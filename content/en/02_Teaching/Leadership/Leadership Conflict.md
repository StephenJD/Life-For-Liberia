# Healthy church audit

Many churches find it helpful to have a “healthy church audit”. You invite a leader from another church to interview a cross section of the leadership and the wider congregation in order to discover of they really have a common vision and to see if the teaching, pastoral and leadership functions within the church are healthy and effective. They then report back to the leadership team to help them improve the quality of their leadership.
