# 7 - The Gospel of Jesus

## Jesus Himself is the Good News

In this study we look at what Jesus said about Himself. It is certainly good news that our sins can be forgiven, and that that we can have peace with God and that when we die we will not face a fearful judgement but mercy and grace and love. But we have seen that the Gospel is more than that; it is the presence of God's Kingdom rule on earth here and now which brings healing and deliverance and hope and peace.

But Jesus' gospel went further even than this. Jesus very clearly presented Himself as the Good News.

## He is the “prophet like Moses”

The LORD your God will raise up for you a **prophet like me** from among your own brothers. You must listen to him. (De 18:15)

He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.” (Isa 2: 3)

In accordance with the ancient prophecy Jesus placed Himself above Moses in authority. Six times in Matt 5:21-48 Jesus quoted from Moses and replaced the Law with His own instruction. “Moses said ... but I say ...”

Jesus made claims to knowing the Father beyond anything Moses could claim:

Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.” And the LORD said, “I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence... But you cannot see my face, for **no-one may see me and live**.” (Ex 33:18-20)

Jesus says He is the only one who has known the Lord face to face; able to speak from having seen God’s face, not just His back:

“No-one knows the Son except the Father, and no-one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.” (Matt 11:27)

“No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.” (Jn 1:18)

“the Father knows me and I know the Father” (Jn 10:15)

“I and the Father are one.” (Jn 10:30)

“I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.” (Jn 16:28)

Before Jesus the people looked to Moses for their instruction, but now Jesus made the Father known.

## He is the anointed one

“I have come from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.” (Jn 6:38)

“I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me.” (Jn 8:42)

“No-one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.” (Jn 6:44)

“Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.” (Jn 10:10)

Jesus is not just another prophet, but a messenger from the very heart of God's presence.

## He is the Prince of Peace

“Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.” (Mk 5:34)

“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives.” (Jn 14:27)

“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” (Matt 11:28-30)

Jesus was not just a peace-maker but a peace giver. Peace is found in Him.

## He is the Eternal King

“You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.” (Jn 18:37)

“The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.” (Jn 3:35)

“The Father judges no-one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son” (Jn 5:22)

“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.” (Matt 25:31-32)

## Jesus is how we know God

No longer will they teach their neighbour, or say to one another, ‘Know the LORD,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the LORD. “For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.” (Jer 31:34)

Jesus presented Himself as the way we can know God.

“I am the way and the truth and the life. No-one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well.” (Jn 14:6-7)

“Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.” (Jn 14:9)

“All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you.” (Jn 16:15)

## Jesus is the victor over our enemy

Jesus' mission was to invaded Satan’s territory and set people free. First He needed to overcome Satan and bind him:

Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. (Lk 4:1-2)

His obedience to the Father gave Jesus full authority and power over Satan and his demons:

“Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.” (Jn 12:31)

“But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. How can anyone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.” (Matt 12:28-29)

“I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.” (Lk 10:18-19)

“Should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?” (Lk 13:16)

## Jesus can forgive us our sins

Before Jesus forgiveness could only be granted through sacrifice, by a priest in God's presence, in the temple. But Jesus claimed the authority from God to grant forgiveness:

“But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins….” He said to the paralysed man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.” (Lk 5:24)

“For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.” (Jn 5:21)

Jesus did not just satisfy God's wrath so that the Father would forgive us; Jesus Himself has the authority to forgive us.

## Conclusion

Jesus is far more than the *means* of our salvation. He is far more than a substitute for our death. He is far more than the light that reveals the Father to us. He is far more than the mediator who reconciles us to God. Jesus Himself is the Gospel. He is the presence of God. He is the Kingdom of God on earth.
