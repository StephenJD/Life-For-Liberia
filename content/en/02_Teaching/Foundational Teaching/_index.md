The subjects of repentance and righteousness often arouse strong emotions amongst Christians because they are both foundational doctrines but also because they touch us deeply; they relate to our deepest needs of acceptance and self-worth. Leaders often have strong opinions about the doctrinal aspects because they are trying to deal with church members whose behaviour is sometimes troublesome. It is important, therefore, that we examine scripture carefully and try to let it instruct us, rather than simply try to justify our own beliefs.
