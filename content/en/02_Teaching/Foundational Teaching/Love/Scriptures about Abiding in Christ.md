**Children of God obey His command to love:**

**We abide in Christ if we love one another:**

**1 John 3:23-24**  And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave us commandment. Now he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.

**We know God if we love one another:**

**We abide in God if we abide in love:**

**1 John 4:15-16**  Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.

**We must love our brothers:**

**1 John 4:20-21**  If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God must love his brother also.

**Loving God causes us to love His children:**

**Abiding in God’s love enables us to love each other:**

**John 15:9-10**  “As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love.”
