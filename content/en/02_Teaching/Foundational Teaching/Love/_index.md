Notice the structure 'He who say's' in vv 4,6,9 similar to the three 'If we say' in 1:6,8,10

What *command* do you think John has in mind in v3-5? (see v7-8)

What *walk* do you think John has in mind in v6?

-   What do you think John is seeking to correct?

-   Why does John use *love* rather than *correct doctrine* as the test?

-   How would you summarise John's test? (Love is the only true test of our knowledge of God.)

-   Who does John apply the test to? (see 2:3, v4, v12-13, 5:13)
