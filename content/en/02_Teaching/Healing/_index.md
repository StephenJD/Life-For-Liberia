We all know that God has the power to heal. But we often question if it is His desire to heal. We know that God wants us to persevere through suffering and assume therefore that through sickness we can grow more Christ like. This leads to uncertainty â€“ 'God may want to heal, but He may have loving reasons not to heal'. So when we pray for God's healing, we pray our best prayer and then trust the outcome to God's sovereignty.
