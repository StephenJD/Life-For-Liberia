# Practical and spiritual hope for rural communities

Two civil wars ending in 2003 killed one in ten people and destroyed 95% of Liberia's infrastructure. There are less than 50 government doctors for the whole country of nearly 4 million. Life expectancy in Liberia is 57 years.

It is among the poorest countries in the world with 85% living below the poverty line.

## Our Aims

Sadly, as in many African nations, there are many people who take advantage of the ignorance of the poor by starting up a church and promising wealth and health to those who give what little they have to the pastor. This widespread evil creates more poverty and brings disgrace on the name of Christ. Our fundamental aim is to facilitate the proclamation and demonstration of the authentic Gospel of Jesus Christ through church planting, leadership training and education.

## How we work

We work directly with local church leaders that we know personally, with whom we are in regular telephone and email communication. Stephen Dolley and Andy Bell visit most years, sometimes with a small team, to develop relationships, encourage the churches and advise on new and existing projects. Every team member finances their trip themselves.

## What we are doing

Our friendship, prayers and annual visits give massive encouragement to the pastors and communities we have befriended. They count this as one of the most valuable contributions we make.

We give training in a number of areas including:

-   Evangelism
-   Healing the sick
-   Disciple-making
-   Church planting
-   Christian leadership

Practical projects:

-   Building schools.
-   Paying for school fees, teachers' salaries and teacher training
-   Providing school materials, laptops, printers, smart-phones, musical instruments

## The Kingdom of God

We promote three different kinds of group:

[Growth Groups](https://life-for-liberia.netlify.app/teaching/discipleship-groups/growth-groups/), [Discovery Groups](https://life-for-liberia.netlify.app/teaching/discipleship-groups/discovery-groups/) and [Missional Communities](https://life-for-liberia.netlify.app/teaching/discipleship-groups/missional-communities/).

Growth groups are very small and are for discipleship.

Discovery Groups are for introducing the gospel to unbelievers, especially when going into a new community.

Missional Communities are for gathering families together within a community to live out the Kingdom of God.

We recommend that churches first introduce Growth Groups to their members and get these well established. Then encourage church members to form Missional Communities around their homes with neighbours.

Then, where you are reaching out to new communities, establish Discovery Groups in unbelievers homes. This is what Jesus instructed when he sent out the disciples two-by two â€“ to find a household of peace and stay there to teach and demonstrate the [Gospel of the Kingdom](https://life-for-liberia.netlify.app/teaching/the-gospel/). When people come to faith, they should be [baptised](https://life-for-liberia.netlify.app/teaching/becoming-a-christian/baptism/) as soon as possible and established in Growth Groups, then impact the wider community through Missional Communities.

All of this can go on without any need for [traditional church buildings](https://life-for-liberia.netlify.app/teaching/church/how-church-buildings-cripple-the-gospel/).
