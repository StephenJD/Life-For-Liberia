Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## Luke 10:5-8 Eat What is Offered to You

>   Luke 10:5-8 Jesus said “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you."

### Note

They were to accept the food and culture of the family, and not impose their own culture. (This shocked the Pharisees because Jews had strict food laws saying they should not eat and drink what unbelievers gave them. See Mark 7:3,14-19, John 4:9).

## Acts 2:1-8 In their own Tongue

>   Acts 2:1-8 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.

>   Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken. Utterly amazed, they asked: “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans? Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?"

## Translation Guidelines

The story shows us that the Holy Spirit wants people to hear the Gospel in their own dialect.

If a gospel story cannot be read in the dialect of the listeners, it must be translated.

We want to take care in translating so the people can have God’s word as accurately as we can manage. This is best done with a small group of people so they can discuss and agree on the best words to use. They do not have to be believers, they just have to be willing helpers.

### Step 1: Understanding

Teach the story, through translation, to the dialect speakers.

-   If any names in the story are difficult or confusing, you could use local names instead.
-   Ask the dialect-speakers lots of questions about the story details to check they have understood the detail correctly.
-   Get the dialect speakers to practice re-telling the story.

### Step 2: Writing down the translation

Now get them to write down the translation.

-   Check that no detail from the story has been added or left out.
-   Do not change things just because you don't like them or do not understand them or because they are culturally offensive.

### Step 3: Try it out

Try the translated story out on some other people to see if you can improve it further.
