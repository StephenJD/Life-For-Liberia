## Training Story Guardians

When you take the Gospel into a new community you will need to teach them many stories. If the new community is not too far away you may be able to teach stories over a period of many months. If you cannot keep visiting you need a different approach…

Effective discipleship can only really take place in small groups. If you have too many people to have small groups, try to select a few people that you will directly train, and let the others observe.

Divide the people between the trainers, giving each group a different story to learn. This way you might be able to teach D1 to D6 in a one hour session.

Or you could teach D1 & D2 (five stories) to everyone on day 1, then on day 2 share out D3-D6 (seven stories).

Teach the chosen story, using the suggested conclusion questions. Do not go into too much detailed discussion, just discuss enough so they are attracted to the Good News.

Tell each group that they are the guardians of that story for their community. They must practice the story and make sure they can retell it accurately.

If the group can write the story in their dialect that will be a valuable resource for the community. Follow the translation guidelines in *G4 Crossing Cultures*.

A community leader could collect copies of the written stories as a community treasure.
