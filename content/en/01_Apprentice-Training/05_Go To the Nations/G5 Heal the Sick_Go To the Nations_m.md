## Luke 10:8-11 The kingdom of God has come near

>   Luke 10:8-11 Jesus said “When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, ‘Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Healing and announcing God's Kingdom provokes openness to hear about Jesus. This is especially important when going to Muslim or traditional-religion (e.g. Poro) areas. Demonstrating the power and presence of the kingdom is far more persuasive than arguments about who Jesus is.
