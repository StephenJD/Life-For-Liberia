### Conclusion

If Muslims say that the Gospel (which they call the Injil) has been corrupted, tell then that the Gospel we have today, is the exact same gospel that Muhammad had in AD600. It is that same Gospel that Muhammad said Muslims should learn from (Surah 43:63) and have faith in (Surah 4:136).

If Muslims raise other objections to teachings about Jesus, invite them to read the Gospel for themselves, and all their questions will be answered.
