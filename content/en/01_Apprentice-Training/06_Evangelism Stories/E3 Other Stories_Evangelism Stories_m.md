## Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd

>   Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.

>   He makes me lie down in green pastures,

>   he leads me beside quiet waters,

>   he refreshes my soul.

>   He guides me along the right paths

>   for his name’s sake.

>   Even though I walk

>   through the darkest valley,

>   I will fear no evil,

>   for you are with me;

>   your rod and your staff,

>   they comfort me.

>   You prepare a table before me

>   in the presence of my enemies.

>   You anoint my head with oil;

>   my cup overflows.

>   Surely your goodness and love will follow me

>   all the days of my life,

>   and I will dwell in the house of the Lord

>   forever.

## Luke 8:43 A Woman Healed

>   Luke 8:43 And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. “Who touched me?” Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.” But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.” Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”

## Luke 5:29 Levi's Dinner Party

>   Luke 5:27 After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him. Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”
