# T3 Motive for a Team

This is the third training in the T-Path: **T**eam Building

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 10:2-3 Ask the Lord to send workers into his harvest

>   Luke 10:2-3 Jesus said, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves."

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Teams are hard! And many teams are pointless! People like to create teams because it makes them feel important. But there has to be a compelling reason to form a team, and without that the team will be fruitless and fail.

The harvest that Jesus sends us into is that reason.

Do you truly believe Jesus is sending you into His harvest field?

Where is that harvest? Write down the places you think Jesus wants you to go.

Do you truly believe you need others alongside you?

You may need several teams. For each place you believe Jesus is calling you to, write down the names of the people you believe you need to be in team with.

Are there any existing teams that you need to withdraw from because they are pointless or fruitless, or Jesus is calling you out of them?

What changes are you going to make in obedience to Jesus?
