Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 16:15 You justify yourselves

>   Luke 16:15 Jesus said, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts".

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Team building is hard! It is mostly our pride that makes it hard. We may have learnt to be humble before Jesus and listen to Him, but it is far more difficult to be humble before one another.

So a good and essential starting point for team building is to commit to Jesus, and to each other, that we will listen to Jesus, and to each other, and not justify ourselves to each other.

What does Jesus want to say to you?
