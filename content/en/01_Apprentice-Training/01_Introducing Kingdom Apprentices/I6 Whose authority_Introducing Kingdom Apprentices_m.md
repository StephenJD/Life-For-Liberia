# I6 Whose authority?

This is the sixth training in the I-Path: **I**ntroducing Kingdom Apprentices.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 21:23-25 By what authority are you doing these things?

>   Matthew 21:23-25 Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. “By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you this authority?” Jesus replied, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. John’s baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?”

What does Jesus want to say to you through this story?

### Conclusion

The chief priests asked a very good question! Any time someone new turns up and starts preaching or teaching we should ask the same question: "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"

When someone starts turning over tables, you want to know who gave them the authority!

We believe we come in Jesus Name and with His authority, but you must be the judge of that.

We do not want to take your church from you, or take control of your church, or ask you for money, or teach some strange doctrines or get you to join our movement.

But we want to be honest and clear with you. Like Jesus, we want to turn over some tables, do a little teaching and healing and then leave. What happens next is up to you. If you conclude that we are helping you to hear and obey Jesus, then we will be happy to share more with you.

### Why "apprentices" instead of "disciples"?

We call obedient disciples of Jesus "apprentices" because it requires practical hand-on experience and practice, and our training takes place in the community on real mission, not in the church classroom.

We train in small groups, teach Gospel stories, and help our apprentices to hear Jesus speak to them and practice their obedience to Him. We train our apprentices to immediately start training up their own apprentices.

Our training is not a magic formula or a rigid unchangeable program, but a listening and learning journey for all of us. It is simply a collection of Gospel stories which we pray the Holy Spirit will be able to use to make each of us into faithful disciples of Jesus. We have only one Master and only one Teacher – Jesus.

Jesus is sending Kingdom-Apprentices to other communities and nations to train obedient disciples who will also go. That is why we would like to come to you and share what Jesus has taught us about making disciples.
