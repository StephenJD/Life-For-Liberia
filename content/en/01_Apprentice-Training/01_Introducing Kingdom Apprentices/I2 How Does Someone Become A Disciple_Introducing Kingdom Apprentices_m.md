What good news is in this story?

What does Jesus want to say to you through this story?

### Some questions

Looking ONLY at this one verse:

How does Jesus describe a disciple in this verse?

How does that person become a disciple? (answer just from this verse)

So what do you need to do to make a disciple? (answer just from this verse)

Now, think about your own growth as a disciple. What has really changed you? Hearing other people tell you about Jesus, or hearing Jesus speak to you?

But what methods do we use to try and make disciples?

Can you see why we are so ineffective at making disciples?

Kingdom-Apprentices make disciples the way Jesus said to do it.
