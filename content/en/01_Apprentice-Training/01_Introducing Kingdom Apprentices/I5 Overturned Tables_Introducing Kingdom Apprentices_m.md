What good news is in this story?

What does Jesus want to say to you through this story?

### Some questions

If you had been standing in the temple at that time when Jesus did this, would you be shocked? Or offended? Or amazed? Or glad?

What do you think would have gone through your mind?

Thinking about your own church and your church services, are there any "tables" you think Jesus may want to overturn?

Kingdom-Apprentices are not afraid to turn over a few tables, and are not upset when Jesus turns our tables over. We serve Jesus, not our traditions.
