# Summary of Introducing "Kingdom Apprentices"
Find us at [Kingdom-Apprentices.net](https://kingdom-apprentices.net/)

"Kingdom Apprentices" is a Disciple-Making Movement to raise up fruitful and obedient disciples of Jesus, transforming lives and whole communities.

Using the same methods that Jesus used, we teach simple Gospel stories and invite people to discuss them and listen to, and obey, what Jesus wants to say to them. The impact of this simple approach has been truly transformative.

This introduction takes the same approach, so we invite you to read the gospel stories carefully and prayerfully and ask Jesus what He wants to say to you through them.
