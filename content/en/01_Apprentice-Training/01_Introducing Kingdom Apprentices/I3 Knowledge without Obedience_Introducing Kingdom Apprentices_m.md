# I3 Knowledge without Obedience

This is the third training in the I-Path: **I**ntroducing Kingdom Apprentices.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 6:46-49 Wise & Foolish Builders

>   Luke 6:46-49 Jesus said “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say? Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the sand. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”

What good news is in this story?

What does Jesus want to say to you through this story?

### Some questions

People come every week to church and hear about Jesus. Because they go to church they call Jesus "Lord". Does learning lots about Jesus make you a disciple? (Answer just from this story).

When we welcome people to church each week, preach to them and then send them home with a smile, we are training them. It is not our words that train them, it is the habit of going to church that trains them. They become church-goers. Is that what Jesus commanded us to do?

What kind of people are you training if you teach lots about Jesus, but forget to make sure they are being obedient?

People need to be taught how to obey Jesus. It does not come naturally. They need to be taught how to read the bible, especially the gospels, how to listen to Jesus speaking to them through the Holy Spirit, how to believe and trust Him and how to do what He says to do. This is what Kingdom-Apprentices do.
