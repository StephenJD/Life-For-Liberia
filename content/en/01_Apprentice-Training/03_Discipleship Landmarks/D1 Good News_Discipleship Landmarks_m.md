# D1 Good News

This is the start of the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

(Words in brackets, like these are guidance for the leader, and not intended to read out to the group)

(Use these stories to invite people to start a new group to learn how to become a disciple of Jesus.)

(If Muslims are present, ask one to read this from the Qu’ran, and afterwards ask the four Q’s. If there are no Muslims, omit the Surah)

## Surah 5:46 We gave Isa the Injil containing guidance and light

>   Surah 5:46 We sent Isa, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Injil (Gospel) containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah - a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.

(**Good News Q**:) What do you like about this story?

(**Listen Q’s**:) Who did Allah give the Injil to?

According to this passage, what is in the Injil?

(**Obedience Q**:) How will you discover this guidance and light?

(**Multiplication Q’s**:) May we share a story from the Injil about Isa, with you and your friends?

## Matthew 11:28-30 Come to me

>   Matthew 11:28-30 Jesus said, “Come to me, all you who are tired and heavy burdened, and I will give you rest. Walk with me and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my walk is easy and my burden is light.”

(**Good News Q**:) What do you like about this story?

(**Listen Q’s**:) What burdens do you have?

What sort of rest does Jesus offer you?

How can you come to Jesus with your burdens?

(**Obedience Q**:) How do you think you could obey Jesus when He says “walk with me and learn from me”?

(Often people ask about church or listening to preachers, so you can ask:)

Does Jesus say “Come to church…”?

Does Jesus say “Learn from the preacher…”?

(Then you can explain that we have not come to start a church, or ask them to come to church, or to leave their church or mosque. We have not come to preach, or tell them what to believe. Many people will not know how to obey this, so you can offer to come back with more stories to help them discover how to walk with Jesus.)

(**Multiplication Q’s**:) Who will you share this story with?

Could we start a little group at your house with some of your friends to discuss more Jesus stories so you can discover how to walk with him and learn from him?

## Acts 26:18 From Darkness to Light

>   Acts 26:18 Jesus said “I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are made righteous by faith in me.”

(**Good News Q**:) What do you like about this story?

(**Listen Q’s**:) What darkness are you aware of in your life?

Who do you think has the right to forgive us our sins?

What do you think it means to be “made righteous”?

(**Obedience Q**:) What do you think Jesus wants to say to you today?

(**Multiplication Q’s**:) Jesus has sent me to you. Who is Jesus sending you to, to share this story with?

Who will you invite to join this group?
