This is the introductory training for the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

Use these stories to invite people to start a new group to learn how to listen to Jesus.

## Surah 5:46 We gave Isa the Injil containing guidance and light

>   Surah 5:46 We sent Isa, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Injil (Gospel) containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah - a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.

We have come to share the guidance and light of the Gospel with you. May we share a story from the Injil about Isa?

## Matthew 11:28-30 Come to me

>   Matthew 11:28-30 Jesus said, “Come to me, all you who are tired and heavy burdened, and I will give you rest. Walk with me and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my walk is easy and my burden is light.”
