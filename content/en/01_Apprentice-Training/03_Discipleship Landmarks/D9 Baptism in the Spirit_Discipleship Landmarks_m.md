# D9 Baptism in the Spirit

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

There are four stories in this training. You may need to take some time to go through them prayerfully and discuss them with your trainer.

## John 3:3-6 You must be Born Again

>   John 3:3-6 Jesus said, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.” “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!” Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit."

## Luke 11:9-13 Ask until you Receive

>   Luke 11:9-13 Jesus said, “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”

>   Acts 19:5-6 “When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.”

### A note for Mentors

Some people say that speaking in tongues is THE evidence of baptism in the Spirit – that if you cannot speak in tongues you have not been baptised in the Holy Spirit. This is not what the bible teaches. Paul teaches about this in 1 Corinthians 12:

>   1 Cor 12:7-11 Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. To **one** there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, **to another** a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, **to another** faith by the same Spirit, **to another** gifts of healing by that one Spirit, **to another** miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, **to another** speaking in different kinds of tongues, and **to still another** the interpretation of tongues. All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.

>   v30 Do all have gifts of healing? **Do all speak in tongues?** Do all interpret? Now eagerly desire the greater gifts.

It is true that most examples of the Holy Spirit being given as recorded in Acts include speaking in tongues, but it is clear from the above passage that this was not always the case. In fact anyone can make up gibberish and call it speaking in tongues. Jesus said a tree is known by its fruit, so we should look for the biblical evidences for baptism in the Holy Spirit in a changed life, not just in the appearance of "manifestations". The final story in this training shows us to look for abounding hope, joy and peace in believing as evidence of the Holy Spirit.
