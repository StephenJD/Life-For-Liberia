This is the final training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

*This story is long. Learn to retell it in your own words.*

## Matthew 25:14-30 Investing Your Life

>   Matthew 25:14-30 Jesus said, “It will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.

>   The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.

>   After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.’ His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

>   The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.’ His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

>   Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’

>   His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. ‘So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'"

What good news is in this story?

What has God given you that He wants you to invest in other people's lives?

Are you regularly taking risks in sharing the Gospel, healing the sick and making disciples?

## Luke 6:39-40 Can the blind lead the blind?

>   Luke 6:39-40 Jesus said, “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.

What good news is in this story?

Gospel stories can only be effectively taught by an apprentice who has made the story their own and has come to love the good news it contains. Each apprentice must pray over the story and listen to Jesus before they can guide others in discovering the good news. Otherwise they will be the blind leading the blind!

Apprentices must understand what the training is about. They must know the training stories well and understand how each story contributes to the training message. If you are not sure why a story is relevant to the training subject, ask other apprentices what they think.

### Conclusion

By now, if you have been obedient to Jesus, you should have plenty of experience starting new Discovery Groups and new Growth Groups. If you are not already training other Kingdom-Apprentices, then now is the time to start. Ask Jesus to lead you to two or three “people of peace” whom you can invest in, to present to Jesus as the fruit of His investment in you.

Also, go through the G-Path (Go to the Nations) stories in your GG, and plan to go to new communities with the Gospel.

We also recommend the P-Path (Prayer) to deepen your prayer-life.

### Apprentice Group (AG)

An Apprentice group (AG) is to train those who want to become Kingdom-Apprentices. It is led by a more experienced Kingdom-Apprentice. The purpose is to make sure apprentices understand the stories and how they relate to the training title, to share insights with each other and to emphasise the need to pray, meditate and obey the stories. It is essential that the apprentices spend time in their GG praying over the story and listening to Jesus and learn to be obedient to it. Apprentices are expected to be starting new groups and training other apprentices.

‘Experts’ do all the training because they are the best at it. But experts only grow by addition, not multiplication. So don't give in to the temptation to do all the training yourself. Jesus did not say make experts, but make disciples! People learn best by teaching, so let new apprentices teach. You need lots of practiced apprentice trainers.

Do you have a passion to make multiplying disciples? Then don't take shortcuts! Jesus said, “Everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.” Proper training is important; “Go slow to go fast”

If apprentices are highly motivated and are also in their own GG, it is possible to train a larger group of Kingdom-Apprentices, but don’t let the group be too large for everyone to contribute fully (six plus the trainer might be a reasonable limit).

Apprentices should practice sharing the “Good News” with each other, using only the words of Jesus in the story without trying to explain it or expand upon it. They should not use any religious words or concepts, or add their own explanations. Practice just using the D1 stories and appropriate questions.
