## Surah 4:171 Allah has no offspring

>   Surah 4:171 “Allah has no offspring”

The Bible confirms that God has no offspring. Jesus describes God as his father in a relational way, not a biological way.

## Matthew 11:27 No One Knows the Son...

>   Matthew 11:27 Jesus said "All things have been given to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."

### Conclusion

Kingdom-Apprentice DNA is **Good News,** **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply**. Look over the D1 and D2 stories again.

The most important step in walking with Jesus is learning to listen to Him. You are unlikely to hear a voice! But if you listen you will get ideas come into your head, or someone else may say something that helps. Just trust Jesus to speak in a way that you can hear. It comes with practice.

Jesus often speaks to us through our discussion. Will you **listen** attentively to each other and not just wait to have your turn to speak?

Will you ask Jesus to show you how He wants you to **obey** each story and listen for His answer?
