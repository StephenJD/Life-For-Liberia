# D13 Healing and the Gospel of the Kingdom

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 4:18-19 Good news to the poor

>   Luke 4:18-19 Jesus said, “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour.”

## Luke 9:1,6 Heal the sick

>   Luke 9:1,6 When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. … So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.

(**Obedience Q’s**:) Will you make sure that when you tell people about Jesus, what you share is Good News to them?

Will you share the Good News of freedom from oppression, healing from sickness, and living in God's favour with your family, friends and community?

Will you offer to heal the sick when you share the Gospel?

Get your trainer to go out with you to show you how to heal the sick. Then go out together as a GG to heal the sick and start new Discovery Groups.

### Healing Guidance

-   Ask what the person wants prayer for (don't assume they want healing)
-   Listen to Jesus for how to pray
-   Speak simply and calmly, without shouting.
-   You might ask Jesus to heal, or command the sickness to go, or bless the person with healing. Whatever you do, do it in faith that Jesus hears and answers.
-   Ask the person if they feel any better or felt God touch them in any way.
-   Keep listening to Jesus, praying and asking the person about any changes. Keep going until you have complete healing, or you feel you should stop.
