Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 5:13-16 Salt and Light

>   Matthew 5:13-16 Jesus said, “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."

(**Listen Q’s**:) How can Christians lose their saltiness?

How can Christians hide their light?

If Christians all go to church on Sundays, is their light visible for all to see, or is it hidden behind walls?

If Christians don’t engage in their community, is their light visible for all to see?

## Luke 5:29-32 Levi's Dinner Party

>   Luke 5:29-32 Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”

(**Listen Q’s**:) Christians often avoid drunks, drug addicts, thieves, layabouts and prostitutes. What does Jesus want for them?

## Luke 18:15-17 Let the little children come

>   Luke 18:15-17 People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”

(**Listen Q’s**:) In church services children are usually kept quiet in a corner. What does Jesus want for the children?

## Luke 22:14-20 The Lord's Supper

>   Luke 22:14-20 Jesus and his disciples reclined at the table. ... And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you."

(**Listen Q’s**:) Did Jesus tell us to remember him with token pieces of bread and little sips of fruit juice?

### Missional Community (MC)

By now, you may be wondering about how “church” fits in with DG’s, GG’s and Kingdom-Apprentices. Well, here is our suggestion for “church”. Instead of copying other people’s traditions, we try to learn from Jesus and do it His way.

Missional Communities (MC’s) help us be salt and light in our communities. They are a great way for GG’s in an area to come together, and are open to anyone who wants to come.

The stories above give you the basic ingredients of a Missional Community:

-   Gathering your local GG’s and neighbours to a meal, celebrating Jesus' life, death and resurrection.
-   Welcoming "sinners" and children.
-   Discussing and planning ways to bless and improve your community.
-   Starting up new GG's for members of the community, including the children.

Will you start a Missional Community with your local GG’s and neighbours?

If anyone in your Missional Community has difficulty with the idea of Breaking Bread over a meal with un-baptised people, go through the N-Path training called "Breaking Bread" (you can find this at <https://kingdom-apprentices.net/en/01_apprentice-training/08_new-wineskins/n6-breaking-bread_new-wineskins_m/> or ask your trainer for a copy).

Here are some other suggestions:

-   Before the meal, tell a bible story.
-   During the meal encourage people to discuss the story.
-   Towards the end of the meal, remind people that you are celebrating Jesus’ life, death and resurrection, and His presence with you today. Raise your cups to Jesus. Someone can pray a prayer of thanks to Jesus and blessing on the gathering.
-   After the meal start discussing community needs and plan how the group can take action to help.
-   Don't let your Missional Community look like a "church service" or a bible-study. It should look more like a family gathering and be lively and fun and engaging. Arrange chairs in circles, not rows like a church!
-   If you have unbelievers present, ask them how they think God may be working in their own lives. Ask them what they can do to cooperate with God and suggest they join a Discovery Group.
-   How can your MC multiply? Is everyone in a GG? Can your MC start a Discovery Group? Or launch another MC nearby or in another community?
-   Before you end, plan when and where you will have your next MC gathering (weekly, or perhaps monthly?).
