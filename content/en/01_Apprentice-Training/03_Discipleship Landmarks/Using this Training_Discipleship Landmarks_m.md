## Discipleship Landmarks Training

A Kingdom-Apprentice is a fruitful, confident and obedient disciple of Jesus who is committed to fulfilling Jesus’ command to make multiplying disciples. Our DNA is **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply**.

This training is designed to be used by any kind of group, including on-line groups. It can also be used by an individual. D5 describes Discovery Groups and Growth Groups.

The first few trainings include some stories from surahs in the Quran for use with Muslim groups. You can omit these for Christian groups.

Use Surah 5:46 (if inviting a Muslim) and Matthew 11:28-30 from D1 to invite people to start a group. At the first group meeting use the next D1 story (Acts 26:18).

## Learning The Stories

We strongly recommend that both the trainer and group members learn the stories by heart so Jesus can keep speaking to you through them. Most stories can easily be learnt word-perfect, but for the longer stories, being able to retell the story in your own words is sufficient.

Use a modern easy to read bible, not the King James!

If any members do not have a bible or cannot read, you can read the passage out loud and let the members record it on their phones.

Whenever you teach a story, if it is something Jesus said, start it with "Jesus said: ". That way the person learning will know that these are the words of Jesus.

Use actions to help people remember the story. Get the members to copy your actions.

Recite the story from memory twice and then say to the group, "**Tell me the same story**".

For a longer story, use this learning tool:

-   Get the members to say every detail they noticed in the story.
-   If they miss anything ask questions to see if they remember the detail.
-   Recite the story from memory twice more.
-   Say, "**Tell me the same story**" until they have got it right.

## 4 Group Rules

These Group Rules have been found to be essential for happy and fruitful groups. Whenever starting any kind of new group, share these Group Rules with the members:

### 1. No Church!

We are not wanting to start a church, or get anyone to start going to church, or to leave their church or mosque.

We are just sharing Jesus stories, so people can become better Christians or Muslims.

### 2. No Preaching Allowed

Members should not preach or teach other members. If people want to hear preaching they can go to church or the mosque!

Each person can share what they think, and no-one should try to correct them or say they are wrong. We do not meet to argue with each other, but to listen to and learn from each other and from Jesus. Children’s groups may need help and reminding not to preach or be bossy to younger children.

### 3. Answer only from the passage

When discussing a passage we ask you to limit your answers to what is in the chosen passage. If people start quoting other scripture, or what they have read or heard from other places, they will sound like an expert and put off those who do not have that depth of knowledge. We need to learn from Jesus, not from our traditions.

### 4. Go at your own speed

There is much that Jesus can teach us through each of these stories, and sufficient time and attention should be given to each story, before moving on to the next. If you progress too quickly without ensuring that the hearers are being obedient to what they are learning, you will train them to be disobedient! They will think that hearing or understanding is all that matters, and that obedience is optional.

Do not wear people out with difficult passages or long meetings (1½ hours is a usual meeting length). You do not need to understand everything, just leave out passages or stories you find too difficult.

Each group must be free to decide when, where and how often they meet and what stories they discuss. They can disband and form new groups if they choose to.

## Questions

Remember, *No Preaching Allowed*! Instead we ask questions to help each person Listen, Obey and Multiply.

#### Listening Questions

Start with Listening questions, like:

-   What do you like about this story?
-   What do you think about this part of the story...?"
-   What good news is in this story?

If the members engage well with these questions, we can try digging a bit deeper with:

-   What does this tell us about people's nature (or character)?
-   What does this tell us about Jesus or God’s nature?

#### Obedience Questions

Once people have thought about the detail of the story, ask Obedience questions, like:

-   What does Jesus want to say to you personally through this story?
-   How will you obey?

It is usually easy to think how a story applies to other people. But whatever it says, ask Jesus what He wants to say to you personally.

#### Multiplication Questions

Finally, ask Multiplication questions like:

Who does Jesus want you to share this story with? (Say their names).

Where does Jesus want us to “Go” to?

Can we start a new group?

Which type of new group shall we start?

These are just suggested questions to get you started. If a question doesn’t work, think of an alternative. But try to make sure you ask Listening, Obedience and Multiplication questions.

## After Each Discussion

Agree the date and time for the next meeting and share the story you will discuss.

Can you copy the bible and D-Path training to people’s smart phones?

Or can you make copies of the D-Path training to give to group members?

Or can members photograph the story?

Or can they record it being read?

Encourage members to read and pray over the story on their own each day before the group meets to discuss it. This makes a huge difference.

Finally, take time to love each other through listening to their concerns and praying for each other.
