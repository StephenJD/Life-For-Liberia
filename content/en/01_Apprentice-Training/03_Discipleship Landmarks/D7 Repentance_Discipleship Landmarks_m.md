# D7 Repentance

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

(Ask the Good News, Listening, Obedience and Multiplication Q’s)

## Mark 1:15 The time has come

>   Mark 1:15 Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent (turn around) and believe the good news!”

(Explain that some translations say “repent from your sins” but the original just says “repent”. Repent means “turn around and go in the opposite direction”)

(**Listen Q’s**:) What direction do you think your life is travelling in?

Why do you think Jesus says we need to “turn around”?

What good news does Jesus want us to believe?

## Luke 24:47 Repentance for the forgiveness of sins

>   Luke 24:47 Jesus said "Repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in My name to all nations."

(**Listen Q’s**:) If we turn our lives around to obey Jesus, what does Jesus promise to do about our sin?

### Conclusion

This is the last training for Discovery Groups.

Those who want to be disciples of Jesus should be in a Growth Group by now, and can continue to D8 - Baptism.

Those who are not ready to join a Growth Group could start a new Discovery Group at D1, or start a Missional Community (see D14). See D5 “Starting New Groups”.
