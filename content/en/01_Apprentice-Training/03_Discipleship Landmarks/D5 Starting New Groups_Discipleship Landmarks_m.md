# D5 Starting New Groups

## Matthew 18:20 Where two or three gather

>   Matthew 18:20 Jesus said "Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."

What good news is in this story?

## Surah 19:34 Isa is the Word of Truth

>   Surah 19:34 That is Isa son of Mary—the Word of truth about which they doubt.

## John 16:13 The Spirit of truth will guide you

>   John 16:13 Jesus said "The Spirit of truth will guide you into all the truth."

What good news is in this story?

## John 7:18 Whoever speaks on their own seeks personal glory

>   John 7:18 Jesus said, “Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.”

What good news is in this story?

Jesus warns us not to love the sound of our own voice and be impressed by our own preaching, but to let Jesus do the talking through the stories he has given us. If we truly seek God’s glory we will value His words high above our own.

## Mark 7:9 You Observe Your Own Traditions

>   Mark 7:9 Jesus said "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!"

We need to learn from Jesus, not from our traditions. That is why we answer only from the passage, and not from what others have told us.

## Different Types of Group

We offer a number of different types of group, but all depend upon the truth of these promises. The groups can be used in families, churches, mosques, schools and out in the community and can include children and young people.

Discovery Groups (DGs) are to help people discover Jesus. They are open to anyone who wants to come, and are often mixed groups of Christians, Muslims and people of other faiths or no faith. They end when they complete D7 - Repentance.

Missional Communities (MCs) help us be salt and light in our communities by taking action on community needs. They are also open to anyone who wants to come. We will learn about these in a later training.

Growth Groups (GGs) are for people who are serious about becoming a Kingdom-Apprentice. A Growth Group is two or three people who meet regularly (usually once or twice a week) to listen to Jesus, learn from the Holy Spirit, love each other and reach out to others.

The aim of Discovery Groups and Missional Communities is to bring people to a place where they really want to be a disciple of Jesus and start a Growth Group.

After a GG has completed the D-Path training, you can use the other story-sets (Prayer, Go to the Nations, Simple Church etc. See www.kingdom-apprentices.net) or work your way slowly through [^1]Luke's Gospel and then John, Mark and Matthew before moving on to other parts of the bible. We recommend you return to at least one of the Gospel's each year.

[^1]: Luke is the best story-teller. John provides lots of application, Mark is full of action, Matthew provides a bit of everything. This suggested order is our recommendation for all new GG's . If you are going through discipleship training you will want to take time in your GG to go through the training stories.

## Starting a new Group

>   To start a new group you must train a new leader for that group, **then leave the group** to continue without you.

>   Leaving the group is essential if we are to multiply. If we do not leave the group, all we can do is to add, not multiply, and we will get exhausted!

Whenever a new group starts, go through the “Using this Training” section at the start of this manual, and start the D-Path at D1, even if the members have already gone through some of the stories in a different group. This is to help ensure sure each member is experiencing the reality of the stories and being obedient to Jesus.

As soon as any member is able to answer the questions properly, get them to take turns to lead the meetings with you assisting them. Once they are confident, leave the group, and go and start another one.

### Don’t use a condom!

Asking people to gather to a public building like a church, mosque or palaver hut is like using a condom! It prevents reproduction. Timid people could not gather a crowd and lead them, so they will not reproduce. But they can invite a few friends and neighbours to share a Jesus story at their home.

### Watering

Paul said, “I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.” When we have “planted” a group we need to “water” it to help it to grow well. This will include faithfully praying for the group’s host and members, phoning the host to encourage them and visiting from time to time to sit in on the group to ensure it is still working well and help with any questions that arise.

### Records

Obtaining regular feedback from groups can help to ensure that they are being effective, and discover if they need extra help or training.

However, many find that writing reports is tedious and difficult. Remember that Jesus said “My burden is light” - keeping records of activity must clearly serve our goal and not become a burden.
