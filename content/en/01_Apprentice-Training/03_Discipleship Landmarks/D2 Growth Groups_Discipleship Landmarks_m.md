They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the sand. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”

### Conclusion

How can you meet with Jesus?

How can you discover truth?

How can you have an unshakeable life?

Would you like to meet in a Growth Group (GG) of two or three people to meet regularly (usually once or twice a week) to listen to Jesus, learn from the Holy Spirit, love each other and reach out to others?

Will you go through each of these stories in your GG?

### Four GG Questions

When the Growth Group meets, you start by reading (or telling) the bible story you have chosen. Each person should then **tell the same story** from memory to make sure everyone understands what they have heard. Then each person should share in discussing these four questions:

1.  What does this tell us about people's character or nature?
2.  What does this tell us about Jesus or God?
3.  What does Jesus want to say to me personally? (How will you obey?)
4.  Who does Jesus want me to share this story with? (Say their names).

Then take turns to pray for each other, and for your outreach to others.

Agree the story for the next meeting. Between meetings pray over the next story every day and see what Jesus says to you, ready for your next meeting.

### Four GG Rules

#### No more than 4 people

Two or three is the ideal size. In larger groups some people will not contribute.

Include small children in a family group. Children who can read can be in their own group –let them ask for help if they want it.

#### No Preaching Allowed

Members should not preach or teach other members. They must help each other listen to Jesus and discover for themselves.

Children’s groups may need help and reminding not to preach or be bossy to younger children.

#### Answer only from the passage

When discussing your passage and answering the GG questions, limit your answers to what is in the chosen passage. If you start quoting other scripture, or what you have learnt from commentaries, or preachers, or bible-school then you will sound like an expert and put off those who do not have your depth of knowledge.

#### Go at your own pace

Go at the pace that suits your group. Do not wear people out with difficult passages or long meetings (1½ hours is a usual GG length). You do not need to understand everything, just leave out passages you find difficult.

GG's must be free from the control of church leaders. They can decide when, where and how often they meet and what stories they discuss. They can disband and form new GG's if they choose to.

Work your way slowly through [^1]Luke's Gospel and then John, Mark and Matthew before moving on to other parts of the bible. We recommend you return to at least one of the Gospel's each year.

[^1]: Luke is the best story-teller. John provides lots of application, Mark is full of action, Matthew provides a bit of everything. This suggested order is our recommendation for all new GG's . If you are going through discipleship training you will want to take time in your GG to go through the training stories.

### Four GG Practices

#### Read the passage each day

You will get much more out of your GG if you read and pray over the agreed passage on your own each day before your GG meets to discuss it.

#### Listen to Jesus and obey Him

When thinking about a passage, it is usually easy to think how it applies to other people. But whatever it says, ask Jesus what He wants to say to you personally. He wants to bless you and help you to become more like Him. But to hear, you must listen!

Be obedient to what Jesus says to you. Obedience is the only thing that counts in being a disciple of Jesus.

#### Pray for each other

Take time to love each other through listening to your concerns and praying for each other.

#### Start New Groups

Share your GG experience with others and help them to start a GG of their own. Pray that you can start GG’s throughout your community and also in surrounding communities.
