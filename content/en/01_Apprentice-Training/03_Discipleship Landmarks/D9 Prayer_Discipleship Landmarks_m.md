Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us. And lead us out of temptation, and deliver us from the evil one.’ For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."
