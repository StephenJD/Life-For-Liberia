Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 8:5-8,11-15 The Four Soils

>   Luke 8:5-8,11-15 Jesus said “A farmer went to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and produced a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.”

>   “This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but when troubles come they fall away. The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life’s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. But the seed on good soil stands for those with a good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persisting produce a crop.

(Use the usual Good News, Obedience and Multiplication Q’s)

(**Listen Q’s**:) What four things must be true if we are good soil? (Hear, Retain, Persist, Produce)

What kind of soil do you think you are? (Most of us are thorny – some growth, but not yet Persisting to Produce a crop).

(**Obedience Q’s**:) What does Jesus want you to persist in?

### Conclusion

Kingdom-Apprentice DNA is **Good News,** **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply**. Look over the D1 to D4 stories again.

“Persisting to produce a crop” is where many apprentices get stuck. They start with enthusiasm but get discouraged by difficulties, just as Jesus describes.

The next training will help you to “produce” by starting a new group.
