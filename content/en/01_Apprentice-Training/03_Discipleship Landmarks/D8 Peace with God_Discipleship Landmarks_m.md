# D8 Peace with God

This is the eighth training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

John 14 is really important and full of deep truth which we need to keep coming back to. The Holy Spirit will teach you more and more as you prayerfully meditate on this chapter. Here we are focusing on what Jesus says about our new relationship with Jesus and the Father.

Believing in Jesus means believing what He says about Himself *and* believing what he says about you.
