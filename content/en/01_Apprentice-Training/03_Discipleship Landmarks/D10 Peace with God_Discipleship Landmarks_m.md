Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

John 14 is really important and full of deep truth which we need to keep coming back to. The Holy Spirit will teach you more and more as you prayerfully meditate on this chapter. Here we are focusing on what Jesus says about our new relationship with Jesus and the Father.

Believing in Jesus means believing what He says about Himself *and* believing what he says about you.

## John 14:1-3 Do not let your hearts be troubled

>   John 14:1-3 Jesus said, “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, *there* you may be also."

(**Listen Q’s**:) The Jews, like many people, already believed in God. What did you used to believe about God that troubled your heart? Did you fear his judgement and wrath? Did you feel ashamed and guilty? Did you feel distant from God?

What does Jesus say that “believing also in me” will change in our relationship with God?

Why did Jesus say “I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you”? What is Jesus trying to reassure us about?

How does this make you feel?

## John 14:6 The way and the truth and the life

>   John 14:6 Jesus said, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."

## John 14:19-20 You are in me, and I am in you

>   John 14:19-20 Jesus said, "Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you."

(**Listen Q’s**:) Why do you “live”? Is it because you are a very good person?

What will you, one day, realize is true?

If you could live every day knowing this, what difference would it make?

## John 14:27 My peace I give you

>   John 14:27 Jesus said, "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid."

(**Listen Q’s**:) Why do these words of Jesus give you peace?

What things could trouble your peace with God?

What does Jesus say about that?
