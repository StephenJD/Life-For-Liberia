This set of Gospel stories are chosen to help a person progress from curiosity about Jesus to become a fruitful, confident and obedient disciple of Jesus.

After teaching each story ask: **What good news is in this story?**

After teaching all the stories for one section, the disciples should go through the stories in their GG, using the GG questions.
