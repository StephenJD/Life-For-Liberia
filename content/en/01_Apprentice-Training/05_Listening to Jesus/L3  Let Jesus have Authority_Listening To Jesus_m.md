# L3 – Let Jesus have Authority

## John 6:60 Who can accept it?

John 6:60,66 On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?” … From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.

Are you willing to hear and accept Jesus’ hard sayings?

Jesus lived according to Kingdom culture and that often clashed with his native culture.

Are you prepared to courageously obey Jesus and walk in the Kingdom, even where it is contrary to your culture?
