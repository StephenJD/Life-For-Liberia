# L7 – My Sheep Hear My Voice

## John 10:27-28 My sheep listen to my voice

>   John 10:27-28 Jesus said, “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand.”

Jesus makes a simple statement of fact: “My sheep listen to my voice”. It is the consequence of being Born Again and filled with the Holy Spirit. If you are in Jesus, you will listen to His voice. So just believe it and practice it!

Jesus does speak to you, and you do hear and listen. Do you recognise that fact?

Do you give special attention to listening to Jesus?

Do you expect to hear Jesus speak to you?

I hope you have found this training path has helped you to really listen carefully to Jesus, especially when He wants to say something unexpected, or challenging to you.

Listening, hearing and obeying is a practice and a journey we are all on. Jesus walks it with us. Have faith, never give up. Have joy and peace in believing.
