# L5 – One Thing is Needful

## Luke 10:38-41 Mary and Martha

>   Luke 10:38-41 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”

>   “Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”

What is Jesus saying to you through this incident?

Martha felt more comfortable serving Jesus rather than listening to him. Many people feel like that.

Doing things can give us a greater sense of achievement than listening.

Listening can seem threatening if we are afraid that we may not hear anything.

What does Jesus want to say to you about this?

Do you have any worries that distract you or hinder you from listening to Jesus?

Our primary need is to sit with and listen to Jesus. Discipleship is not about teaching people good doctrine, or good behaviour. It is teaching people to listen to Jesus. Everything else flows naturally from that.

What does Jesus want you to do about this?

-   In your own devotional life?
-   In your own Growth Group?
-   In your leadership role?
-   In your discipling of others?
-   In your church?
