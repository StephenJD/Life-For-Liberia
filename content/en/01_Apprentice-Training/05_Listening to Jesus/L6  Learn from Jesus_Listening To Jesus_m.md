# L6 – Learn from Jesus

## Matt 11:28-30 Walk with me and learn from me

Matt 11:28-30 "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Walk with me and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my way is easy and my burden is light.”

Who needs to learn from Jesus?

(I hope you answered “Me” and not “Everyone else!”. See L4)

How do you put this invitation into practice personally?

I cannot listen for you, or teach you, or feed you.

I may be able to bring you to Jesus, and show you what He says, and show you how I obey him. But you must hear for yourself and learn from Him. That is what Jesus said.

The main way I listen to Jesus and learn from Him is to memorise and meditate on Jesus’ words. I often spend days or even weeks or months going over the same passage. Praying and listening and asking Jesus to speak deeply into my heart.

Walking and learning also includes obedience. We learn from Jesus as we go out in obedience, loving, healing, sharing, praying.

If “doing” is a distraction for some that stops them listening, then for others, “Listening” is an excuse to never “do”. Jesus made it clear in the story of the wise and foolish builders (see D3) that those who hear but do not “do” are not His disciples.

What would Jesus say to those who think we should spend as much time as possible at church in prayer meetings and bible studies?

What does Jesus want to say to you about walking with Him?
