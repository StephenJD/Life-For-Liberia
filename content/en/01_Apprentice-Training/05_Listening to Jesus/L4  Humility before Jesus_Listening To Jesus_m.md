# L4 – Humility before Jesus

## Luke 18:9-14 I thank you that I am not like other people

>   Luke 18:9-14 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”

It is all too easy for us to become like this Pharisee. We assume we are already living in obedience and think that anything we read in scripture is for other people, not us!

Through familiarity with the Gospels we can easily become deaf to Jesus! We can nod in recognition of the familiar stories without letting them speak to us deeply. We have defences against the words that challenge the status quo.

Will you prayerfully listen to Jesus in this story and see if you sometimes react like this Pharisee?
