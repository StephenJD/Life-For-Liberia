# L2 – Eating and Drinking Jesus

## John 6:56-57 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me

>   John 6:56-57 Jesus said, “Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.”

Food becomes a part of us and sustains our efforts.

How can you “eat His flesh and drink His blood” and “feed on Him”?

What do you have to do with food for it to become part of you? - Prepare it, put it in your mouth, chew it, swallow it, digest it, use its strength.

What are the equivalent steps to feeding on Jesus?

What preparation do you need to do? Perhaps booking out some quiet time, finding a quiet place, turning your phone off…

How would you “put it in your mouth”? – perhaps read it a few times to make sure you understand the words and its basic meaning.

How would you “chew it”?

What might “swallow it” mean? Perhaps memorising the scripture you are meditating on.

How would you “digest” the scripture?

How would you “use its strength”?
