Jesus has called us to do the impossible and make disciples of all the nations. The only way we can do this is by listening to and obeying Jesus. No training manual or book â€“ even the bible itself, is sufficient. We must be listen to and obey the Holy Spirit that Jesus has given us. We must learn to Listen to Jesus.
