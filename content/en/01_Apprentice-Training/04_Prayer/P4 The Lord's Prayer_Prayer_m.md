## Matthew 6:9-10 This Is How You Should Pray

>   Matthew 6:9-10 Jesus said, "This is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be honoured, and your kingdom come, and your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us. And lead us out of temptation, and deliver us from the evil one.’ For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."
