# P12 Deliver us from the evil one

This is the twelfth training in the P-Path: **P**rayer.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

Much of the popular teaching about spiritual warfare is contrary to what we see in Jesus ministry and teaching. Let us learn from Jesus.

## Matthew 4:1-11 Jesus led by the Spirit to be tempted

>   Matthew 4:1-11 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written: ‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’” Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’” Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour. “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship me.” Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’” Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.

## Luke 22:31-32 I have prayed that your faith may not fail

## Luke 10:17-19 I saw Satan fall like lightning

>   Luke 10:17-19 The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.” He replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you."

## Ephesians 6:10-12 Our Struggle Is Not Against Flesh And Blood

>   Ephesians 6:10-12 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armour of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

### Conclusion

Even though "our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but ... against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms." we overcome evil, as Jesus did, by standing firm in the truth, and as the disciples did, by healing and delivering people in the authority of Jesus. Jesus never told us to rebuke or bind Satan or his schemes – only God can do that (see Jude 1:8-10).

Will you wage war with prayer, love, truth, faith and obedience?
