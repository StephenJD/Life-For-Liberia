### Conclusion

Studying scripture is how God starts a conversation with you. Will you then ask Him what He wants to say to you and listen carefully?

Even Jesus' closest disciples had hard hearts and deaf ears! Are you able to recognise that your heart is also hard? Pray for a soft, attentive, willing heart.

Will you listen quietly and carefully to Jesus today – and obey Him?

Sometimes physical quiet and stillness is the way for you to listen to Jesus. Other times it may be through physical activity like walking or running, or dancing or weeding or digging... Learn and practice what works for you to calm your mind and listen to Jesus. Jesus' transfiguration took place after the hard physical exercise of climbing a mountain! Find what works for you.
