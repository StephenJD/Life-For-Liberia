## Luke 6:46-49 Wise and Foolish Builders

>   Luke 6:46-49 Jesus said “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say? As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the sand. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”
