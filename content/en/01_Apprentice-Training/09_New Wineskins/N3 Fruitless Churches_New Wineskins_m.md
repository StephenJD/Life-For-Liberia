## Luke 13:6-9 The Figtree in the Vineyard

Note: a fig tree is a very large tree, with big leaves that block out the sun. A vine is a low-growing plant that is cut back every year.

>   Luke 13:6-9 Jesus said “A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, ‘For three years now I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’ “ ‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone for one more year, and I’ll dig around it and fertilize it. If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.’ ”
