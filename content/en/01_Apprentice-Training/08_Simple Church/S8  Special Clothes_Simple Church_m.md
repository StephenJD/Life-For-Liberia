# S8 – Special Clothes

This is the eighth training in the S-Path: **S**imple Church.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 23:5-7 Everything They Do Is For Show

>   Matthew 23:5-7 Jesus said, “Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries a wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honour at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others."

What does Jesus want to say to you about wearing special clothes for church services?

What does Jesus want to say to you about having special places for leaders to sit?

What does Jesus want to say to you about people calling you "Pastor"?

## James 2:2-7 Fine Clothes and Filthy Old Clothes

>   Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Here’s a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,” have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? But you have dishonoured the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong?

Do you and many others dress up for your church services? What would strangers feel if they came in poor clothes and no shoes?

Does your church dress for mission, to make the poor feel welcome, or to look smart to "honour God" or impress others?

What does Jesus want to say to you about changing the dress-code in your church?
