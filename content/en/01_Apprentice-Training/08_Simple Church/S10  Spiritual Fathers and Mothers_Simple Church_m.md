# S10 – Spiritual Fathers and Mothers

This is the tenth training in the S-Path: **S**imple Church.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 23:8-10 Do Not Call Anyone On Earth ‘Father’

>   Matthew 23:8-10 Jesus said “But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah."

Do you let people address you with any special title, such as "Pastor" or "father" or "mother"?

Do you have a spiritual father or mother or sons or daughters?

Are there people who think of you as their spiritual father or mother?

What does Jesus want to say to you about these titles?

### Conclusion

There are a lot of areas mentioned above where we recognise we have followed the traditions of men instead of obeying Jesus.

I hope that you will listen to Jesus and try your best to obey Him by correcting these outward and inward practices.

The most important thing is to open our spiritual ears to hear Jesus and our hearts to obey Jesus. Without that our 'house' will fall in a terrible destruction (Luke 6:49).
