# S3 - Knowledge without Obedience

This is the third training in the S-Path: **S**imple Church.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 6:46-49 Wise & Foolish Builders

>   Luke 6:46-49 Jesus said “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say? Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the sand. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”

Both builders in this parable have *heard* Jesus' teaching. So what makes you a *wise* builder?

What kind of people are you raising up if you teach lots about Jesus, but forget to make sure they are being obedient?

## John 5:39 You study the Scriptures diligently

>   John 5:39 Jesus said "You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life."

What is the reason that these people are studying the scripture?

These people are very knowledgeable about scripture. They have been going to church for years and have learnt their scriptures well.

Would you be pleased if all your church members were this diligent in bible study?

What is the problem with how these people are studying the scripture?

What does Jesus want to say to you about your approach to bible study and how you teach scripture?

## Matthew 13:14-15 You will be ever hearing but never understanding

>   Matthew 13:14-15 Jesus said, "You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. For this people’s heart has become hard; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes."

If you keep preaching and teaching but do not make sure the hearers are practicing what they are learning, what will the result be?

In your attempts to teach people about Jesus, are you actually training them in disobedience?

What does Jesus want to say to you about this?
