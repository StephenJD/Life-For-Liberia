# S1 - Church - A Command or a Tradition?

This is the first training in the S-Path: **S**imple Church.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Mark 7:9 You Observe Your Own Traditions

>   Mark 7:9 Jesus said "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!"

Ask Jesus to help you recognise where this is true in your church.

## Matthew 28:19-20 Go and make disciples

>   Matthew 28:19-20 Jesus said, "Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you."

There is not a single command in scripture to start churches or run church services!

How effective have you been in making obedient disciples of Jesus?

Do you think that your church is a truly effective means of making obedient disciples of Jesus?

## Matthew 7:21 Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’

>   Matthew 7:21 Jesus said, “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."

When you gave an account of your life to Jesus and you tell him how you faithfully led a church in His name, what will you answer when He says, "But I never asked you to lead a church, I commanded you to make disciples."?
