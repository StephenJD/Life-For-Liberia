# S6 - Personal Glory

This is the sixth training in the S-Path: **S**imple Church.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## John 7:18 To Gain Personal Glory

>   John 7:18 Jesus said, "Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him."

Do you love to impress when you preach? Do you love to get applause and make people laugh? Do you try to be engaging and dramatic and passionate?

None of these things are automatically good or bad – it all depends upon who you are trying to glorify. It is all too easy to try and glorify ourselves whilst preaching about Jesus!

The disciples had constant arguments about position and prestige and we have continued in their footsteps!

What does Jesus want to say to you about your desire for prestige and respect?

What does Jesus want to say to you about the effectiveness of your preaching to change people compared to the power of His word and His Spirit?

Will you spend more time teaching people to listen to Jesus instead of getting them to listen to your preaching?
