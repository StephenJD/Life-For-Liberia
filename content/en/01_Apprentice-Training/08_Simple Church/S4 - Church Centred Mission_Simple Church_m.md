# S4 - Church Centred Mission

This is the fourth training in the S-Path: **S**imple Church.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 11:28-30 Come to me

>   Matthew 11:28-30 Jesus said, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”

Churches are usually centred around a building, the pastor and church programs.

Jesus said, "Come to me..." not "Come to church...".

What does Jesus want to say to you about treating church as the place for people to come to Jesus?

## Matthew 5:15-16 Don't hide your light

>   Matthew 5:15-16 Jesus said, "Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."

Do you think that building a special church building and gathering believers there for worship is in line with what Jesus said?

We shouldn't hide ourselves away but, as much as is possible, meet in public places where all can see us.

## Luke 10:8-9 Heal the sick... and tell them...

>   Luke 10:8-9 Jesus said, “When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’"

What did Jesus say to do in the towns and villages? He never said to build churches and start church services!

What does Jesus want to say to you about church buildings in places you are doing mission?

## John 2:23-24 Jesus Would not Entrust Himself to the Crowds

>   John 2:23-24 Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name. But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people.

Jesus never made appeals for people to follow Him, and never suggested that anyone should pray the "sinner's prayer". Repentance, obedience and baptism were the marks of conversion, not a raised hand.

What fruit has come from your church's revival meetings and crusades? Have you baptised believer's as a result? Have you raised money from them?

What does Jesus want to say to you about your reliance upon revivals and crusades?
