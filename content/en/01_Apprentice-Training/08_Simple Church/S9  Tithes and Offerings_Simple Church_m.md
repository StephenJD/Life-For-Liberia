# S9 – Tithes and Offerings

This is the ninth training in the S-Path: **S**imple Church.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 6:3-4 Let Your Giving be in Secret

>   Matthew 6:3-4 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

Are your offerings taken publicly so everyone can see who gives and who does not? How would someone who is too poor to give feel?

What does Jesus want to say to you about this?

## 2 Corinthians 9:7 Give without Compulsion

>   2 Corinthians 9:7 Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.

How many tithes/offerings are taken at your services?

Do you try to persuade people to give? Do you quote verses about God rewarding our giving? Do you rely on the collection to support your family?

What does Jesus want to say to you about how you take offerings?
