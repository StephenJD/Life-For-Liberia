# S2 - The Cost of Church Services

This is the second training in the S-Path: **S**imple Church.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 13:6-9 Fig Tree in the Vineyard

>   Luke 13:6-9 Jesus said, “A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, ‘For three years now I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’"

A fig tree takes up huge amounts of moisture and goodness from the soil and takes lots of sunlight from the vineyard. Churches are like this. They take up a huge amount of resources.

The vineyard represents disciple-making (see John 15:1-8).

Think about all the resources of time, money, planning, buildings, enthusiasm, good-will, commitment and hard work that goes into keeping church services going each week.

Do all these resources produce a good crop of obedient disciples of Jesus? What does Jesus want to say to you about this?

## Matthew 23:4 Cumbersome loads on people’s shoulders

Matthew 23:4 Jesus said "They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them."

Matthew 11:28 Jesus said "My yoke is easy and my burden is light."

What meetings does your church have each week and each month? Do you have Sunday school followed by the main service? Wednesday and Friday evening meetings? Choir practice? Leadership meetings? Fasting and watch-nights? Morning prayer meetings? Crusades and revivals? What other meetings do you have?

Is coming to all these meetings seen as a sign of commitment to Jesus?

What does Jesus want to say to you about this?
