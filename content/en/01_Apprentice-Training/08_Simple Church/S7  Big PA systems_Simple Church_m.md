# S7 – Big PA systems

This is the seventh training in the S-Path: **S**imple Church.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## John 12:28-29 The crowd said it had thundered

>   John 12:28-29 Jesus said, "Father, glorify your name!” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.” The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered.

Do you try to make your own thunder, or do you leave it to God?

Many West African churches blast their services through powerful PA systems. This seems to be valued as a means of advertising the services. But PA makes no contribution to making obedient disciples, and it is probably damaging the hearing of those in attendance. A loud PA will drive away those who find the noise uncomfortable and it encourages an emphasis on the noise that we can make rather than listening to the quiet voice of Jesus.

What does Jesus want to say to you about your use of loud PA?

We in the *Kingdom Apprentices* family encourage a single simple unpressured offering for sharing with those in great need and for mission. The purpose of the offering should be made clear each time it is taken.
