# M1 Finding Apprentices

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

This is the first training in the M-Path: **M**ultiplying Disciples.

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of Apprenticeship then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Matthew 4:18-20 Follow Me

>   Matt 4:18-20 While walking by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus saw two brothers, Simon and Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” Immediately they left their nets and followed him.

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Jesus saw two brothers working hard at their trade.

Jesus offered a more rewarding "trade" – fishing for men, not just smelly fish!

Simon and Andrew were ordinary labourers, not educated leaders.

Simon and Andrew responded immediately and wholeheartedly.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

Anyone can become a disciple of Jesus.

Being made into a fisher of men requires an apprenticeship ("Follow me, and I will make you...)

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Jesus invites you to join with others in learning how to fish for men in God's Kingdom.

Will you become an apprentice and learn how to be a fisher of men?

Will you find two or three other believers and tell them that if they follow you, you will train them to become fishers of men (or church-planters, or missionaries)?

We want every believer to become a labourer in God's harvest field, so we ask you to find one man, one woman and one child to be your apprentices. It doesn't matter what their ages are relative to yours. Even a child can train two adults. All you need to be able to do is to obey what you learn and pass on what you learn to others.

## Luke 10:2 Ask the Lord to send workers into his harvest

>   Luke 10:2 Jesus said “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

God has prepared many people in this community to come into His Kingdom.

God needs people to labor with Him to bring in the harvest.

God urges us to pray earnestly to Him for laborers.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

This community is a ripe harvest field.

The harvest depends upon much earnest prayer – and obedient laborers.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you pray earnestly, every day, for God to raise up and send out laborers into this community?

Will you become an obedient apprentice labourer for this community?

Will you train up other apprentices to be obedient laborers in God's harvest?
