# M10 Discovery Group Training

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of Discovery then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Luke 8:4-8 The Four Soils

>   Luke 8:4-8 While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.” When he said this, he called out, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”

>   John 6:45 It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

A crowd of people were curious about Jesus.

Jesus told the people a story.

The story was about the different ways people respond to Jesus' words.

Some of the people had ears to hear God speak to them through the story.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

Stories are Jesus' way of reaching out to unbelievers.

Stories can be told to groups of people.

The stories allow people to respond in their own way.

Those who hear God speak to them through the story will come to Jesus.

Some of the hearers will become fruitful disciples.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you try to find groups of people to tell Bible stories to?

Will you allow the people to discuss the stories and discover their meaning for themselves?

Will you help people to apply those stories to themselves?

Will you trust God to speak through the stories into people's hearts.

## John 3:10-11 You are Israel’s teacher

>   John 3:10-11 Jesus said “You are Israel’s teacher, and do you not understand these things? Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony."

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Leaders in any community have a responsibility to try and understand the things of God.

Jesus spent time teaching spiritually open leaders.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We should help community leaders recognise their God-given responsibility to understand the truth.

We should help them listen to Jesus through the bible.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you try to persuade community and religious leaders to let you lead a Discovery Group in their home?

## Discovery Group

The stories above have given you the basic ingredients of a Discovery Group – telling and discussing Bible stories to groups of people and letting them discover what Jesus is saying to them.

Here are some other suggestions:

-   Groups of 4-12 people is ideal. Start more groups if more people are interested.
-   Base the group in the community, not in a church building.
-   Use the Story-Telling training to learn how to tell the stories.
-   Use the GG training to learn the 4 questions to ask.
-   Invite the Discovery Group to become a Missional Community as soon as you can.
-   Look on the website for suggested Discovery Group stories.
