# M4 Understanding the Training Stories

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of training through stories then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Mark 8:17-18 Are your hearts hardened? Do you have ears but fail to hear?

>   Mark 8:17-18 Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: “Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don’t you remember?"

## John 3:11 We speak of what we know

>   John 3:11 Jesus said, "Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony."

Tell the story and get people to retell it . Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Sometimes we hear or read a story but do not properly understand what Jesus means.

Jesus only taught what He knew from God and had seen Himself.

Some people won't even accept our own experience (testimony).

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We can only train using a story if we understand the story ourselves.

We may need help to understand Jesus' meaning.

The stories we tell need to become our stories – the things we have heard God speak to us in our hearts.

Teaching things that have not become our own story is ineffective.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you prayerfully study each training story you are taught and ask Jesus to give you revelation and a clear understanding of how the story applies to the teaching point? Without this your training will fail. The "How will I Obey the Story?" section will show you what the training-goal is. Make sure you can see how the bible story leads to these applications.

Will you put each training story into practice in your own life, so that it becomes your testimony?

Will you use your Apprentice-Growth-Group (AGG) to discuss the training story and get insight from the other members.

Will you ask your trainer and your trainer's trainer to help your understanding?
