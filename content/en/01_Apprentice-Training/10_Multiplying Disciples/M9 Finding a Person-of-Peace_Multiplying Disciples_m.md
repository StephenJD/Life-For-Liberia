# M9 Finding a Person-of-Peace

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## Luke 10:5-7 The Person of Peace

>   Luke 10:5-7 “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house."

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Go out looking for people of peace, and enter their houses (or courtyards).

Offer peace to the house.

Accept hospitality and eat what is offered to us.

Do not move around from house to house.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We should try to share the Gospel with groups of people not just individuals.

We should focus on one receptive family or group and try to go to everyone.

Let people welcome us into their space and relationships, rather than us trying to get them to come into ours.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you go out looking for households or groups of people you can share Good News with?

Will you start by offering peace and blessing from God to the people?

Will you try to enter their world and accept their hospitality rather than be like a stranger trying to judge or change them?

Will you stay and give time for a relationship to develop, rather than rushing away to tell others?

## John 4:4-42 Woman at the Well

Note: This is by far the longest story in our training paths. It is so full of good instruction that it is well worth teaching it. Each community or group will need to work out their own ways of learning the story. They could act it out, or write songs, or draw pictures or collect objects to help them remember it. Or they could record it being read on their phones.

There are many things we can learn from Jesus through this story, and you should share and discuss the story often.

For the purpose of this training we will restrict our discussion to **finding a person of peace**.

>   John 4:6 Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon. When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Will you give me a drink?” (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.” “Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?”

>   Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”

>   He told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.” “I have no husband,” she replied. Jesus said to her, “You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.” “Sir,” the woman said, “I can see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.” “Woman,” Jesus replied, “believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.” The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.” Then Jesus declared, “I, the one speaking to you—I am he.”

>   Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?” Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?” They came out of the town and made their way toward him.

>   Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.” But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” Then his disciples said to each other, “Could someone have brought him food?” “My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. Don’t you have a saying, ‘It’s still four months until harvest’? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. Thus the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true. I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.”

>   Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.” So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. And because of his words many more became believers. They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.”

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

How did Jesus discover if the woman was spiritually open?

Why was the woman (and the disciples) surprised that Jesus asked for water?

What did Jesus do about this cultural barrier? (He crossed over to her culture rather than demanding she conform to His).

How did Jesus introduce a spiritual conversation? (He connected a natural need (thirst) with a spiritual need.)

How did Jesus try to turn this into a group-encounter instead of just talking to one individual? (Go and call your husband, and eventually she called the whole town)

How did the woman try to turn the conversation away from her personal life? (She raised a cultural disagreement)

How did Jesus deal with this attempt to start an argument? (He spoke our personal responsibility to God in true worship)

What shows that this was a "woman of peace"? (She went and told the whole town!)

Why did Jesus speak to the disciples about the harvest? (The person of peace is God's strategy for reaping the harvest).

What did Jesus say had already happened before the harvest? (Others had done the hard work).

How did Jesus respond to the welcome he received?

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

Jesus went searching for a person of peace (like he told the disciple to go... in Luke 10).

He asked for water and accepted what she gave, despite it being against his own culture (Like Luke 10:6)

Jesus made connections between their common natural need (water) and God's provision of spiritual refreshment (the Spirit).

Jesus asked her to bring others from her community.

Jesus avoided impersonal arguments and turned it back to her relationship with God.

Jesus uses the incident to train his disciples in the person-of-peace for reaping the harvest.

Jesus shows us that sowing and watering is necessary before the harvest.

Jesus stayed where he was welcome, rather than quickly going to the next pace.

The towns people believed because they heard from Jesus Himself.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you search and pray for people of peace?

Will cross over cultural barriers to connect with others?

Will you ask individuals to invite their family, friends and community leaders to hear about Jesus?

Will you search for common ground and avoid arguments?

Will you stay and persist in developing friendship and trust once you find a welcome?

Will you invite the group to host a Discovery Group in their home / community?
