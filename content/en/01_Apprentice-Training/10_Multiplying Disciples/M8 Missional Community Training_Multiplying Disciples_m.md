# M8 Missional Community Training

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of a MC then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Matthew 5:13-16 Salt and Light

>   Matthew 5:13-16 “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."

Tell the story and get people to retell it . Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Who do you think Jesus is talking to? (Only the 12 original disciples? Or only church leaders? Or every believer?)

Who should benefit from the salt and the light? (Only church-goers? Only other believers? Everyone in our community?)

Who is the salt and the light? (Only Jesus? Jesus seen in our lives?)

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

How can Christians lose their saltiness? (Being disobedient to Jesus; not loving others; getting involved in arguments; being harsh to their partners or children; being legalistic Christians; ignoring the needs of their community).

How can Christians hide their light? (Hiding away in church buildings and church services; not befriending their neighbours; not telling their community about Jesus)

How can Christians be salt and light in their community? (Get involved in improving the community; helping those in need; loving those who are without friends; start DG's, GG's and MC's)

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you be obedient to Jesus?

Will you move the salt and light out of church and into the community?

What will you do to be salt and light in your community?

What specific needs are there within your community that you and other believers could help with?

Missional Communities are a biblical way to get involved in your community so that you can multiply obedient disciples of Jesus. Will you start a Missional Community with your neighbours?

## Luke 5:29-32 Levi's Dinner Party

>   Luke 5:29-32 Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”

Tell the story and get people to retell it . Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Where did Jesus go to make disciples? (A home in the community, NOT church!)

What kind of people were there? (Sinners, NOT church members)

What sort of event was it? (A meal, not a church service or a bible study)

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

How does this compare with usual church practices?

Which approach do you think is likely to be more effective in multiplying disciples?

Who are the "sinners" in your community that others reject or avoid? (Drunks, drug-addicts, trouble-makers, Muslims, witch-doctors, followers of traditional religions...)

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you follow Jesus' example?

Will you move disciple-making out of church and into the community?

Will you host a meal and invite your neighbours – even those who are rejected as sinners?

This is what Missional Communities try to do.

## Luke 22:10-20 The Lord's Supper

>   Luke 22:10-20 Jesus said, “As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’ He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.” They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.

>   When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. And he said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.” After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.” And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you."

Tell the story and get people to retell it . Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Where did Jesus share the Lord's Supper? (A house, not a church)

What kind of event was this? (A meal, not a church service)

How much do you think they ate and drank? (Enough to fill them, not just tiny nibbles)

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

How does Jesus' meal compare with "breaking bread" in church?

What difference do you think it could make to celebrate the Lord's Supper in a house instead of in church?

What difference do you think it could make to celebrate the Lord's Supper as a meal instead of a church service?

What difference do you think it could make to celebrate the Lord's Supper eating a full meal instead of just tiny nibbles?

Do you remember the story of Levi's Dinner Party? Could you use a Lord's Supper meal to introduce Jesus to unbelievers?

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you follow Jesus' example?

Will you move the Lord's Supper out of church and into the community?

Will you host a meal with your neighbours and celebrate Jesus' life, death and resurrection?

This is what Missional Communities try to do.

## Luke 18:15-17 Let the little children come

>   Luke 18:15-17 People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”

Tell the story and get people to retell it . Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Why do you think the people wanted Jesus to place his hands on their babies?

Why do you think the disciples rebuked them?

In what way do you think the kingdom of God belongs to young children?

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

How are children treated in your church compared with this story?

How are children treated in your community compared with this story?

Are your children brought to Jesus Himself, to develop their own relationship with Him?

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you follow Jesus' example?

Will you lay hands on, and pray for, the little children in your community?

Will you welcome the children into your community meals and tell them about Jesus?

Will you start GG's for children?

This is what Missional Communities try to do.

## Missional Community

The stories above have given you the basic ingredients of a Mission Community

-   Gathering your neighbours to a meal, celebrating Jesus' life, death and resurrection.
-   Welcoming "sinners" and children.
-   Discussing and planning ways to bless and improve your community.
-   Starting up GG's for the members of the community, including the children.

Here are some other suggestions:

-   Before the meal, tell a bible story.
-   During the meal encourage people to discuss the story.
-   Towards the end of the meal, remind people that you are celebrating Jesus life, death and resurrection, and His presence with you today. Raise your cups to Jesus. Someone can pray a prayer of thanks to Jesus and blessing on the gathering.
-   After the meal start discussing community needs and plan how the group can take action to help.
-   If you have unbelievers present, ask them how they think God may be working in their own lives. Ask them what they can do to cooperate with God and suggest they join a Discovery Group.
-   How can your MC multiply? Is everyone in a GG? Can your MC start a Discovery Group? Or launch another MC nearby or in another community?
-   Before you end, plan when and where you will have your next MC gathering (aim to meet every week).
