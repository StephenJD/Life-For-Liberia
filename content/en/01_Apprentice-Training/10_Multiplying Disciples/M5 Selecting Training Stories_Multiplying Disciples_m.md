# M5 Selecting Training Stories

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of training through stories then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Mark 4:33-34 He always taught them with Parables

>   Mark 4:33-34 With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.

## John 5:39-40 You study the Scriptures diligently

>   John 5:39-40 You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.

Tell the story and get people to retell it . Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Jesus used many stories to teach – far more than is recorded in the gospels.

We need to come to Jesus through the stories – otherwise it is all pointless.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We need to choose stories that will help people come to Jesus and obey Him.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you pray for your apprentices that they will encounter Jesus through the stories?

Will you prayerfully select training stories that will help your apprentices grow in obedience to Jesus?

Will you ask Jesus to guide you to other bible stories that will help train your apprentices in obedience to Jesus?

If you find stories that work better for you or for those you are training, then use those instead.

Will you help us all become better trainers by sharing your experience with us? Please let us know what stories you find work well and which do not work well.

## Training Paths

Check on the website often, as we continue to develop our story-based training.

We have several training-paths:

### Multiplication-Tools (M-Path)

>   Luke 10:2 “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."

This path is for training believers to become labourers in the harvest field. This is the starting point for training Multiplying Disciples. You should teach each tool in this order.

The tools are:

1.  Finding Apprentices
2.  Discovery Learning
3.  Apprentice Growth Groups
4.  Understanding Training Stories
5.  Selecting Training Stories
6.  Growth Groups
7.  Story Telling
8.  Missional Communities
9.  Finding a Person-of-Peace
10. Discovery Groups
11. Go and Make Disciples
12. When it Breaks

### Go to the Nations (G-Path)

>   Matt 28:19 "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations..."

This path is to train you in going to other communities and other cultures with the Gospel.

1.  To the Ends of the Earth
2.  Pray for Workers
3.  Zero-Cost Mission
4.  Crossing Culture
5.  Heal the Sick
6.  Story Guardians

### Discipleship Landmarks (D-Path)

>   Matt 28:19-20 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

This path is help a person who has decided they want to follow Jesus to become a fruitful obedient disciple. The first four stories are quite challenging and should not be rushed. You may need to use stories from the Evangelism Path to help a person decide that they truly want to follow Jesus. After Repentance, it should not take very long to disciple the new believer through the rest of the path. As soon as possible the new believer should be encouraged to join an Apprentice Growth Group.

1.  Discovery
2.  Good Soil
3.  Only Jesus
4.  Repentance
5.  Baptism
6.  Baptism in the Spirit
7.  Peace with God
8.  Growth Group
9.  Prayer
10. Sharing your story
11. Healing and the Gospel of the Kingdom
12. Missional Communities
13. Multiplying Your Life

### New Wineskins (N-Path)

>   Luke 5:38-39 "New wine must be poured into new wineskins. And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, ‘The old is better.’”

>   Luke 16:15 He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight."

>   Mark 7:9 “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!"

This path is for challenging the traditional ways believers often think about church and disciple making to show us the Kingdom way of thinking. You can teach these stories in any order. If a pastor or apprentice has a struggle to accept one of the Multiplication-Tools, you can look for a story in this path that may help. If you are training people who are used to traditional churches you may need to teach some of these stories before you can start teaching the Multiplication-Tools.

This path includes stories for:

-   Relationship Hierarchies
-   Self-Replicating Ministry
-   Fruitless churches
-   Release or Control
-   Obedience Based Discipleship
-   Disciples not Members
-   Everyone a Church Planter
-   Who is the Teacher?
-   Discipleship DNA
-   Apprentice or Professor?
-   Leaderless Multiplication
-   Good News – not Condemnation
-   Breaking Bread with unbelievers

### Evangelism (E-Path)

>   Luke 19:10 "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”

This path is simply a growing set of Discovery-stories that can be used to let Jesus speak to unbelievers. We hope you will actively contribute to this collection from your experience in evangelism.

Conversion from another religion or African traditional culture.

Come to me

Finding Treasure

Mad, Bad or God

Do not prevent the children...

I am the light of the world

My peace

Lazarus and the Rich man.

Prodigal son.

### Catalysts (C-Path)

>   John 12:9 Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.

A catalyst is a small ingredient that makes a huge difference to the rate of growth. This path is a collection of individual ingredients that have been found to make a massive difference to the growth of a Disciple Making Movement. It is really important for the leading trainer in any network of apprentices to study and apply these stories. They will want to ensure that these lessons are applied throughout the disciple-making-movement. These stories can be taught in any order and at any time.
