Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## Luke 8:5-8 The Four Soils

>   Luke 8:5-8 “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.”

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Some seed doesn't take root at all.

Some seed grows rapidly but then fails.

Only some of the seed multiplies into a harvest

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We must expect that only some people are truly good soil – even some that seem good turn out to be fruitless.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you keep sharing the Gospel and trying to make disciples, and not get discouraged and give up if an apprentice turns out to be poor soil and unfruitful?

Will you try to find good-soil disciples, and invest your training into them?

Will you warn unfruitful disciples that they seem to be poor soil, and you need to look for better soil?

## Luke 22:3-6 Judas discussed how he might betray Jesus

>   Luke 22:3-6 Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. They were delighted and agreed to give him money. He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

One of Jesus' disciples betrayed Him.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

Judas valued money more than Jesus.

The apprentices that Judas had been training lost their trainer!

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

What do you think may have happened to Judas' apprentices?

What will you do if one of your apprentices gives up obeying Jesus?

What will you do if your trainer gives up obeying Jesus?

What other problems do you think might occur between trainers and apprentices? (sickness, death, moving away, occupied by work or family concerns, unresolved disagreements...)

Don't let someone else's problems make you unfruitful! - Speak to your trainer's trainer, or speak to your hub-trainer.
