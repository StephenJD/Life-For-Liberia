# M2 Discovery Learning

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of Discovery then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Mark 4:34 He always taught them with Parables

>   Mark 4:34 He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.

## John 3:31-32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard.

>   John 3:31-32 Jesus said "The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. He testifies to what he has seen and heard."

## John 4:42 Now we have heard for ourselves

>   John 4:42 They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.”

## John 6:45 Everyone who has heard the Father comes to me.

>   John 6:45 Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Jesus always used stories (parables) to teach.

Jesus did not explain the parables unless people asked Him to.

Jesus explained the parables only to his disciples.

Our words are weak compared to the words of Jesus.

We teach what we think is true, Jesus says what He knows is true.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We should let Jesus speak through the bible into people's hearts and not use our words instead.

Jesus wants people to discover truth for themselves from the stories.

We must avoid telling people what to understand or what to believe.

When using stories for training we may need to help explain them.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you use bible stories to share the Gospel and train others?

Will you avoid preaching to others or telling them what they should learn?

Will you trust Jesus and let people discover truth for themselves?

When sharing bible stories, if you are asked what it means, will you share what the story means to you and what you think Jesus is saying to you and help others apply the story to themselves?

When you are training will you still let discovery happen, but if the teaching points do not emerge naturally then offer guidance to ensure that the training lesson is learnt?
