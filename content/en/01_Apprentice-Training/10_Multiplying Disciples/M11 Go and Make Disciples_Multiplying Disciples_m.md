# M11 Go and Make Disciples

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of being a "missionary" then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Matthew 28:18-20 Go and make disciples of all nations

>   Matt 28:18-20 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”
