## Luke 7:36-50 Simon's Dinner Party

>   Luke 7:36-50 When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.

>   When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.” Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” “Tell me, teacher,” he said.

>   “Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred dollars, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?” Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.” "You have judged correctly,” Jesus said. Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.” Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”

1.  Tell the group they are going to learn the story word-for-word, so they must pay attention.
2.  Read the story to the group **twice**.
3.  Asks lots of questions about the story details – let anyone answer.
4.  Read the story again.
5.  Get one person to tell the story back (you can use gestures as prompts). Ask the group to correct any mistakes that are made as it being told. If the group does not notice a mistake, you should correct it.
6.  Ask if anything was added or left out when the story was retold.
7.  Continue with this practice until everyone has retold the story.
8.  Get the group to act out the story. Have fun – but make sure the story is told exactly.
9.  Help the group to discuss the story. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Jesus is sharing a meal with Simon, who is an unbeliever in Simons house.

A sinful woman was drawn to Jesus.

The Simon thinks that Jesus should not let the sinner-woman near him.

Jesus tells Simon a story and asks him what he learns from it.

Jesus applies the story to Simon and the sinner woman.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We should socialise with unbelievers so we can share Jesus.

We should look for opportunities to share bible stories that are relevant to the situation.

We should ask questions to help the listeners interpret the story themselves instead of telling them what it means.

We should help the person see how the story applies to them.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Why do you think Jesus told Simon a story instead of just telling him off for being judgemental?

Discuss what you think the benefits of story-telling could be compared with normal preaching. Try to come up with as many benefits as you can. (e.g. people who cannot read, more engaging, less confrontational, deeply challenging, easy to pass on, gathers a crowd, adaptable to different cultures, memorable so the Holy Spirit can keep working through the story for days, weeks and months after it was shared.)

Will you use bible stories to help people discover bible truth for themselves?

## Finding a Good Doctor

This is NOT a bible story!

You have a pain in your stomach which won't go away. You go to a doctor and he takes you into his consulting room and without even asking you what is wrong, he take a medicine off his desk and gives it to you, saying "Take this" and he sends you away. Will you go back to that doctor?

So you go to another doctor. This one asks you what your symptoms are and listens carefully to you. Then he opens his medicine cabinet, but there is only one medicine there. He gives it to you, saying "Take this" and he sends you away. Will you go back to that doctor?

So you go to another doctor. This one asks you what your symptoms are and listens carefully to you. Then he opens his medicine cabinet, and there are many medicines there. He reads the labels and looks them up in his book and eventually selects one. He gives it to you, saying "Take this" and he sends you away. Will you go back to that doctor?

What do you need to do to become a good story-teller?

## No Experts

We must not allow the trainer or anyone else to appear like an expert with special knowledge.

During story discussion, if anyone tries to teach anything that is not found in the story, ask "Where is that in the story?" or if anyone asks a question that cannot be answered from the story say, "The story doesn't tell us".

If the point being discussed came up in a previous story the group has learnt you should remind them of that story. Or if the point is important, but hasn't yet been covered, you can teach the bible story that does answer the question (you may suggest you teach it at the next meeting).

## Story Telling Suggestions

-   If you do not have time to teach the bible story by heart, then read it twice and ask the detail-questions. Then go on to the discovery discussion.
-   Change **minor** details to suit the culture (e.g. local names or places, local food e.g. cassava instead of bread, local idioms, easier words). Do not change things just because you don't like them, or you do not understand them or because they are culturally offensive.
-   See "G4 Crossing Culture" for guidance on translating stories into the local dialect.
-   See "G6 Story Guardians" for guidance on teaching stories or training to oral cultures, and teaching many stories in a short time.
