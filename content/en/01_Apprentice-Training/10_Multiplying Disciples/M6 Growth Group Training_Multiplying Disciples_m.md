# M6 Growth Group Training

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of a GG then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Matthew 18:20 Where two or three gather

>   Matthew 18:20 "Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."

## John 16:13 The Spirit of truth will guide you

>   John 16:13 "The Spirit of truth will guide you into all the truth."

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Discuss what you think is good about this story?

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

What is Jesus teaching you from this story?

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you find one or two friends and agree to meet regularly to listen to Jesus through the bible stories?

Will you expect Jesus to teach you?

## Luke 6:46-49 Wise and Foolish Builders

>   Luke 6:46-49 “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say? As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the sand. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

People love to hear about God.

People are not so keen to obey!

People think that maturity as a disciple is about learning more truth.

Jesus says what counts is obedience, not knowledge.

### What comes Out of the Story?

We need to measure discipleship and maturity by obedience, not knowledge.

Only obedience to Jesus pleases God.

Obedience makes us strong, disobedience makes us weak.

### How will I Obey the Story?

Will you agree to meet regularly in a Growth Group to listen to AND OBEY what Jesus teaches you?

## Luke 11:34-36 The Lamp of the Body

>   Luke 11:34-36 “Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness. See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.”

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

What does Jesus mean when he says "the light **within** you"? What kind of light is that?

### What comes Out of the Story?

How could a **part** of your body be in darkness?

What parts of a person's life might be hidden in darkness?

### How will I Obey the Story?

Will you agree to let Jesus' light enter every part of your life?

Will you share your inner life in your Growth Group so that you can support and pray for each other?

## Growth Groups

In obedience to the stories above, a Growth Group (GG) is two or three[^1] people who meet regularly (usually once or twice a week) to learn from Jesus, love each other and share in an adventure of faith. If any member is not yet a Christian, consider including more unbelievers and run your group as a Discovery Group.

[^1]: Where there are four or more people, some can easily become spectators.

### Four Questions

When the Growth Group meets, you start by reading (or telling) the bible story you have chosen. Each person should then repeat the story from memory in their own words to make sure everyone understands what they have heard. Then each person should share in discussing these four questions:

1.  What does this tell us about people's character or nature?
2.  What does this tell us about Jesus or God?
3.  What does Jesus want to say to me personally?
4.  Who does Jesus want me to share this story with?

Then take turns to pray for each one in the group, and for your Missional Community and other outreach.

Agree on the story for the next meeting. Between meetings pray over the next story every day and see what Jesus says to you, ready for your next meeting.

### GG Advice

Do NOT preach! Members should not preach or teach other members. We must help each other listen to Jesus and discover for themselves.

Go at the pace that suits your group. Do not wear people out with difficult passages or long meetings (1½ hours is a usual GG length). You do not need to understand everything, just leave out passages you find difficult.

A good place to start is going through the Discipleship Landmarks stories[^2]. After that work your way slowly through Luke's Gospel[^3] and then John, Mark and Matthew before moving on to other parts of the bible. We recommend you return to at least one of the Gospels each year.

[^3]: Luke is the best story-teller. John provides lots of application, Mark is full of action, Matthew provides a bit of everything. This suggested order is our recommendation for all new GG's .

Include small children in a family group. Children who can read can be in their own group – let them ask for help if they want it. Older children may need reminding not to preach or be bossy to younger children.

GG's must be free from the control of church leaders. They can decide when, where and how often they meet and what stories they discuss. They can disband and form new GG's if they choose to.
