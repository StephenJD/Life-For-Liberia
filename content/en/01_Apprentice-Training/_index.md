This is a set of Training-Paths you may use to help you make disciples of Jesus Christ.

'Introducing Kingdom Apprentices (I-Path)' introduces you to our approach to disciple-making. This is primarily aimed at leaders.

'Young Disciples (Y-Path)' is designed to inspire young people to become like Jesus. It can be used with any age, from pre-school onwards. Adults will enjoy this as well.

'Discipleship Landmarks (D-Path)' This is the main resource for making disciples (we call them apprentices).

'Prayer (P-Path)' This is a great resource for anyone wanting to learn to pray as Jesus taught us to pray.

'Listening to Jesus (L-Path)' is to help an apprentice learn how to listen carefully to Jesus.

'Go To the Nations (G-Path)' This to inspire and prepare an apprentice to go and make disciples in other communities and nations. There is specific training here for sharing Jesus with Muslims.

'Simple Church (S-Path)' is aimed at pastors and leaders to help them think through what Jesus said about many of our familiar church practices.

'New Wineskins (N-Path)' is aimed at church leaders to help them thing through some leadership issues. It also takes a fresh look at breaking-bread.

'Kingdom of God (K-Path)' looks in detail at the Gospel that Jesus and the apostles taught. It's not what we are commonly taught!

'Team-Building (T-Path)' is aimed at those trying to establish team ministry.

'Evangelism Stories (E-Path)' is a collection of gospel stories that have been found effective in outreach. It includes the 'Seven Signs' stories from John's Gospel.

'Creation to Christ (C-Path)' is a collection of 28 stories starting with Creation and ending with the Ascension of Jesus. Many Disciple-Making Movements use this story set for evangelism.
