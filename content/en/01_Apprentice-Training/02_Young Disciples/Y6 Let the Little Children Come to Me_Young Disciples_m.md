This is the sixth training in the Y-Path: **Y**oung Disciples.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 18:15-17 Receive the Kingdom like a child

>   People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”
