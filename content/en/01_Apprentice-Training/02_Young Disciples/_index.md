Telling children what they must do to obey Jesus can be very damaging. They need to be *inspired* to become like Jesus. This training is to help young disciples become inspired to listen to and obey Jesus.

After teaching each story, ask these two questions:

1.  What inspires you about Jesus?

2.  What does Jesus want to say to you?
