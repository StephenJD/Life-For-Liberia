This set of Gospel stories are chosen to help people to see how relevant Jesus is to their lives.

We recommend you use D1 and D2 stories for initial evangelism. But you may feel that other stories are more appropriate initially. The Evangelism Path suggests numerous other stories you might consider.

It is up to you to pray through these stories and see what ideas the Holy Spirit gives you.

Feel free to discuss in the WhatsApp group or through the contact form how any of these stories could be used.
