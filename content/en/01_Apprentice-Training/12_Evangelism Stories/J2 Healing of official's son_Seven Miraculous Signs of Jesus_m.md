## John 4:46-54 Healing of official’s son

>   46 Then Jesus went back to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. A government official was there whose son was sick in Capernaum. 47 When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to go to Capernaum and heal his son, who was about to die. 48 Jesus said to him, “None of you will ever believe unless you see miracles and wonders.”

>   49 “Sir,” replied the official, “come with me before my child dies.”

>   50 Jesus said to him, “Go; your son will live!”

>   The man believed Jesus' words and went. 51 On his way home his servants met him with the news, “Your boy is going to live!”

>   52 He asked them what time it was when his son got better, and they answered, “It was one o'clock yesterday afternoon when the fever left him.” 53 Then the father remembered that it was at that very hour when Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” So he and all his family believed.

>   54 This was the second miracle that Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.
