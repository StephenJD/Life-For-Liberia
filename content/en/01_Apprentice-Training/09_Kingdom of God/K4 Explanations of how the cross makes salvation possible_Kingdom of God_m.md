# K4 Explanations of how the cross makes salvation possible

This is the fourth training in the K-Path: **K**ingdom of God.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

The gospels record many occasions when Jesus told his disciples that he would die and rise again. But we have not seen any mention of the cross!

>   John 1:29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!”

Could Jesus have explained His role as “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” as part of His Gospel message from the beginning?

After the resurrection Jesus explained the theology of His death and resurrection in private conversation with trusted disciples:

>   Luke 24:26-27 Jesus said, “Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?” And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.

Is it conceivable that when the gospels were written, the authors did not understand the role of the cross in salvation?

Is it a terrible accidental omission that the gospel writers offer no explanation of how the cross deals with our sin and makes salvation possible?
