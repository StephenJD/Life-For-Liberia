# K1 The Gospel Jesus Preached

This is the first training in the K-Path: **K**ingdom of God.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Introduction

If someone gave you 30 minutes to tell them the Gospel, would you need to explain why Jesus died on the cross?

Have you ever wondered how Jesus shared the Gospel? After all, Jesus had not died on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins and the Holy Spirit had not been poured out to fill us with God’s presence.

This study is to help us discover what Gospel Jesus preached.

Be warned! The journey is difficult, shocking and perilous. Difficult, because we are so conditioned to understand the Gospel through the lens of the cross it is difficult to conceive of the Gospel in any other way. Shocking, because the central theme of all our preaching and worship – the Cross - is missing from the Gospel Jesus preached. And perilous, because to accept and adopt the Gospel Jesus and the Apostles preached requires the abandonment of much that we have been taught about the Gospel.

## Jesus’ Gospel

In your Growth Group look at the following scriptures: What do they tell us about people and God and the Gospel?

>   Mark 1:15 Jesus said, “The time has come. The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!”

>   Luke 10:1,9 After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go … Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you.’

>   Luke 4:18-19 Jesus said, “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour.”

How might we express the gospel based on these scriptures?

Can you see this same gospel in the great commission?

>   Matthew 28:18-20 Jesus said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples … and surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”
