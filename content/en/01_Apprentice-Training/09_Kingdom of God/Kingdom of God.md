# K7 Proclaiming the Gospel

This is the seventh training in the K-Path: **K**ingdom of God.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

What have we learnt from Jesus about sharing the Gospel?

When I started to learn from Jesus about sharing the gospel I felt like he had taken away a nice easy tool (the bridge illustration) and left me with a really hard to communicate idea of the Kingdom of God. I spent months trying to come up with a Kingdom version of the Four Spiritual Laws, and was really pleased when I eventually boiled it down to three words. I'm not going to tell you those three words because I have never used them. I discovered a much better way to share the gospel. I am ashamed to admit that it took me so long to discover this truly amazing and powerful way of sharing the gospel.

I let Jesus share the gospel:

>   Mattew 11:28-30 Jesus said, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”

There are many other Gospel stories we can use. They are the sword of the spirit. Let's use them.
