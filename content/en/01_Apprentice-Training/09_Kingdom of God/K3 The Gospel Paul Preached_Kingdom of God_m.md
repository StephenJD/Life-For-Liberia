# K3 The Gospel Paul Preached

This is the third training in the K-Path: **K**ingdom of God.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

When we come to Paul we have to take care to distinguish between the theology he wrote about in his letters to believing churches, and what he preached to unbelievers. In this study we are trying to discover the gospel Paul preached to unbelievers.

What does the book of Acts tell us about the Gospel Paul preached?

>   Acts 19:8 Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.

>   Acts 28:31 Paul proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with all boldness and without hindrance!

We have discovered a remarkable unity across the four Gospels and Acts showing us what the Gospel was that Jesus and the Apostles preached to unbelievers. It was known as “The Gospel of the Kingdom”.
