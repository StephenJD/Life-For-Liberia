# K5 Forgiveness in the Gospel Message

This is the fifth training in the K-Path: **K**ingdom of God.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

>   Luke 24:47 Jesus said “Repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in My name to all nations.”

We know that Jesus had to die on the cross for our sins to be forgiven. What explanation does Jesus give for forgiveness?

>   Matthew 9:2-6 Some men brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven." At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is blaspheming!" Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
