# K6 The "Four Spiritual Laws"

This is the sixth training in the K-Path: **K**ingdom of God.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

The "Four Spiritual Laws" were devised in the 1950's by Crusade for Christ as an easy way to share the gospel. They are four powerful biblical truths:

1: God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.

2: Human sin has separated us from God and His plan for us.

3: Jesus is God’s provision for human sin, through whom we can know God’s love and plan for us.

4: We must each invite Jesus to be our Saviour and Lord.

This approach is a reasoned explanation of the need for salvation and the mechanism of salvation. It puts explaining sin and its remedy at the heart of the gospel message.

However, we have discovered that this is not the way Jesus, or the apostles, shared the Gospel. What reason does Paul give for sticking to the Gospel Jesus preached:

>   1 Corinthians 4:20 “The kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.”
