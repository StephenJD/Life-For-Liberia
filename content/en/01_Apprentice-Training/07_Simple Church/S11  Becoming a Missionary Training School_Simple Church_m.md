# S11 – Becoming a Missionary Training School

Is Jesus calling you to stop focussing on your church and start to make obedient disciples who will go and make obedient disciples?

If so, how can you do this?

### Conclusion

There are a lot of areas mentioned above where we recognise we have followed the traditions of men instead of obeying Jesus.

I hope that you will listen to Jesus and try your best to obey Him by correcting these outward and inward practices.

The most important thing is to open our spiritual ears to hear Jesus and our hearts to obey Jesus. Without that our 'house' will fall in a terrible destruction (Luke 6:49).
