# T1 I'm OK. It's the others...

### Conclusion

Team building is hard! It is mostly our pride that makes it hard. We may have learnt to be humble before Jesus and listen to Him, but it is far more difficult to be humble before one another.

So a good and essential starting point for team building is to commit to Jesus, and to each other, that we will listen to Jesus, and to each other, and not justify ourselves to each other.

# T2 Motive to Lead

This is the second training in the T-Path: **T**eam Building

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 22:24-26 The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them

>   Luke 22:24-26 A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves."

## Luke 17:7-10 We have only done our duty

>   Luke 17:7-10 Jesus said “Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, ‘Come along now and sit down to eat’? Won’t he rather say, ‘Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink’? Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do? So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’ ”

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 10:2-3 Ask the Lord to send workers into his harvest

### Conclusion

Teams are hard! And many teams are pointless! People like to create teams because it makes them feel important. But there has to be a compelling reason to form a team, and without that the team will be fruitless and fail.

The harvest that Jesus sends us into is that reason.

Do you truly believe Jesus is sending you into His harvest field?

Where is that harvest? Write down the places you think Jesus wants you to go.

Do you truly believe you need others alongside you?

You may need several teams. For each place you believe Jesus is calling you to, write down the names of the people you believe you need to be in team with.

Are there any existing teams that you need to withdraw from because they are pointless or fruitless, or Jesus is calling you out of them?

What changes are you going to make in obedience to Jesus?

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 18:19 Where two of you agree

>   Matthew 18:19 Jesus said “Truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven."
