### Inspired to Follow

Telling children what they must do to obey Jesus can be very damaging. They need to be *inspired* to become like Jesus. This training is to help young disciples become inspired to listen to and obey Jesus.

After teaching each story, ask these two questions:

1.  What inspires you about Jesus?
2.  What does Jesus want to say to you?

Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.” “Why were you searching for me?” he asked. “Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?”
