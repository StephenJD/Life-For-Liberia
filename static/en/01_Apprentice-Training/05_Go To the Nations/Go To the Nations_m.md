# G3 Zero-Cost Mission

This is the third training in the G-Path: **G**o to the nations.

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## Luke 10:3,8 Take No Purse

>   Luke 10:3,8 Jesus said "Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road...When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you."

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Imagine you had been set on a scary mission you felt unprepared for. Why might you stop and greet everyone you met along the way?

Discuss the reasons why giving money to your hosts is a bad idea.

-   It creates wrong and damaging expectations.
-   It reinforces donor dependency.
-   It encourages people to come for the food or money they can get instead of for the Good News.
-   It encourages people to reduce the number of people invited so they can keep more of the money for themselves.
-   It makes going on mission more difficult because you have to raise the money to give away.

# G4 Crossing Culture

This is the fourth training in the G-Path: **G**o to the nations.

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## Luke 10:5-8 Eat What is Offered to You

>   Luke 10:5-8 Jesus said “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you."

What good news is in this story?

### Note

They were to accept the food and culture of the family, and not impose their own culture. (This shocked the Pharisees because Jews had strict food laws saying they should not eat and drink what unbelievers gave them. See Mark 7:3,14-19, John 4:9).

## Acts 2:1-8 In their own Tongue

>   Acts 2:1-8 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.

>   Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken. Utterly amazed, they asked: “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans? Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?"

## Translation Guidelines

The story shows us that the Holy Spirit wants people to hear the Gospel in their own dialect.

If a gospel story cannot be read in the dialect of the listeners, it must be translated.

We want to take care in translating so the people can have God’s word as accurately as we can manage. This is best done with a small group of people so they can discuss and agree on the best words to use. They do not have to be believers, they just have to be willing helpers.

### Step 1: Understanding

Teach the story, through translation, to the dialect speakers.

-   If any names in the story are difficult or confusing, you could use local names instead.
-   Ask the dialect-speakers lots of questions about the story details to check they have understood the detail correctly.
-   Get the dialect speakers to practice re-telling the story.

### Step 2: Writing down the translation

Now get them to write down the translation.

-   Check that no detail from the story has been added or left out.
-   Do not change things just because you don't like them or do not understand them or because they are culturally offensive.

### Step 3: Try it out

Try the translated story out on some other people to see if you can improve it further.

# G5 Heal the Sick

This is the fifth training in the G-Path: **G**o to the nations.

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## Luke 10:8-11 The kingdom of God has come near

>   Luke 10:8-11 Jesus said “When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, ‘Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Healing and announcing God's Kingdom provokes openness to hear about Jesus. This is especially important when going to Muslim or traditional-religion (e.g. Poro) areas. Demonstrating the power and presence of the kingdom is far more persuasive than arguments about who Jesus is.

# G6 Have Courage

This is sixth G-Path training. **G**o to the Nations.

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

Going into a new community can by scary! Imagine you are about to enter a new community as you discuss these stories.

## Matthew 12:28-25 Jesus has Bound the Strong Man

>   Matthew 12:28-29 Jesus said, “If it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. How can anyone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house."

What good news is in this story?

## Matthew 10:16 Be Shrewd and Innocent

>   Matthew 10:16 Jesus said, “I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves."

What good news is in this story?

## Hebrews 10:35-38 Have Confidence

>   Hebrews 10:35-38 Do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised ... But my righteous one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back.

# G7 Prepare the Way

This is the seventh training in the G-Path: **G**o to the nations.

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## Luke 3:4 Prepare the way for the Lord

>   Luke 3:4 Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.

What good news is in this story?

### Prepare Our Hearts

Go through this training, praying and listening to Jesus.

### Prepare Our Skills

Learn at least Discipleship Landmarks D1-D6 stories by heart.

Across the world it has been clearly shown that people who have learnt the stories by heart are far more effective in mission than those who have not.

### Prepare the community we wish to visit.

It is important to visit the town chief, Imam and other key community leaders a day or two before trying to gather people to share the Gospel. Explain you want to come to heal the sick and teach stories about Jesus. We found that sometimes telling the town chief was not enough – he might fail to pass the message on to the rest of the village. So get several people to promise to spread the news of your visit.

Avoid the three C’s: **C**hurch, **C**hristianity and **C**onversion.

It is important that you **don't** talk about Christianity, conversion, changing their beliefs, going to church or starting a church. Many communities will either be hostile to these ideas or will have very wrong ideas about them.

Instead explain you want to help them to learn more about Jesus, so they can become better leaders who learn to listen to and obey Jesus (or Isa).

### Prepare our strategy

The goal is to teach the community to listen to Jesus and obey Him.

The strategy is to establish on-going Discovery Groups and/or Growth Groups in the community.

Therefore the community needs to be taught a good number of stories and be taught how to discuss them and listen to Jesus.

#### Teach the Stories

If you have more than one day, then take the first day to teach everyone D1(Discovery) and D2(Growth Groups). If you only have one day, teach D1-D6, following the guidelines in *G9 Story Guardians*.

Teach the chosen story, using the suggested conclusion questions. Do not go into too much detailed discussion, just discuss enough so they are attracted to the Good News.

If you have just taught D1 then offer to teach them three more stories (D2). They now have seven wonderful stories that they can teach each other and discuss more fully with their families and friends. Teaching D1 & D2 should take under 2 hours.

#### Teach them to Pray

After learning the story, show the group how to pray for each other and pray for healing. Don’t do all the praying yourself – get them to pray and heal each other in Jesus’ name. Get them to write their names down for you, along with the story number and name, so you can give this a community leader.

#### Go house to house

Then have the group members take you round the community. As they go from house to house, get them to share the story they have just learnt and then pray for the people. Retelling the story will reinforce their memory and give you the opportunity to correct any small mistakes.

#### Start a Growth Group that evening

Arrange to meet with the group in the evening to have a GG discussion about one of the stories they have learnt. Pray that Jesus will clearly speak to each member of the group through the story.

Teach them the 4 GG Questions, the 4 GG Rules and the 4 GG Practices. Then get one of the group to lead the discussion, with you assisting and guiding.

If the group could write the story in their dialect that would be a good additional step. A community leader could collect copies of the written stories as a community treasure.

#### Find the Person of Peace for the community

Pray that God will show you who is the most faithful person in the community. Give them the list of story guardians and explain that they are intended to be discussed in order (D1 to D6). Have a GG with this person to model the discussion, emphasising the need to listen to Jesus and obey Him.

#### Baptisms

When the community has gone through D1 to D6 you should arrange to re-visit and have a special day to teach D7- Baptism in the Spirit, and then baptise all the new believers, pray for them to be baptised in the Holy Spirit and have a big feast to celebrate this major Landmark in Discipleship.

#### Going on

The Baptism in the Spirit stories will probably take four GG meetings to go through. After that there are seventeen Discipleship Landmark stories in D8-D13. Hopefully by now you will have enough Story Guardians in the community for you to teach all these stories in a day or two.

# G8 Story Guardians

This is the eighth training in the G-Path: **G**o to the nations.

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## 1 Timothy 6:20-21 Guard what has been entrusted to your care

>   1 Timothy 6:20-21 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith.

### Conclusion

Will you be a guardian of Bible Stories?

Will you learn them and make sure you keep them accurate?

Will you train up story guardians in the communities you reach out to?

Will you go through this story in your GG?

## Training Story Guardians

When you take the Gospel into a new community you will need to teach them many stories. If the new community is not too far away you may be able to teach stories over a period of many months. If you cannot keep visiting you need a different approach…

Effective discipleship can only really take place in small groups. If you have too many people to have small groups, try to select a few people that you will directly train, and let the others observe.

Divide the people between the trainers, giving each group a different story to learn. This way you might be able to teach D1 to D6 in a one hour session.

Or you could teach D1 & D2 (five stories) to everyone on day 1, then on day 2 share out D3-D6 (seven stories).

Teach the chosen story, using the suggested conclusion questions. Do not go into too much detailed discussion, just discuss enough so they are attracted to the Good News.

Tell each group that they are the guardians of that story for their community. They must practice the story and make sure they can retell it accurately.

If the group can write the story in their dialect that will be a valuable resource for the community. Follow the translation guidelines in *G4 Crossing Cultures*.

A community leader could collect copies of the written stories as a community treasure.

# G9 Blessing Muslims

This is the ninth training in the G-Path: **G**o to the nations.

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

### Muslim Disciples of Jesus

If you are visiting a Muslim community, do all you can to keep any new disciples part of their Muslim community, attending their Mosque and bringing the Good News of Jesus to their Muslim brothers and sisters. If the entire Mosque is following Jesus, they may want to worship and pray in a new way, but they should be urged not to mimic a western or African style church.

## Surah 5:82 Christians devoted to learning

>   Surah 5:82 "You are sure to find those closest in affection towards the believers are those who say, “We are Christians”, for there are among them those devoted to learning and ascetics. These people are not given to arrogance…"

## Surah 19:33-34 Jesus is the Word of Truth

>   Surah 19:33-34 So Peace is upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the Day I get resurrected alive. That is Jesus son of Mary—the Word of truth about which they doubt.

## Surah 4:158-159 Jesus will be our Judge

>   Surah 4:158-159 Allah raised him up to Himself. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. Every one of the People of the Book will definitely believe in him before his death. And on the Day of Judgment Jesus will be a witness against them.

### Conclusion

If Muslims say that the Gospel (which they call the Injil) has been corrupted, tell then that the Gospel we have today, is the exact same gospel that Muhammad had in AD600. It is that same Gospel that Muhammad said Muslims should learn from (Surah 43:63) and have faith in (Surah 4:136).

If Muslims raise other objections to teachings about Jesus, invite them to read the Gospel for themselves, and all their questions will be answered.
