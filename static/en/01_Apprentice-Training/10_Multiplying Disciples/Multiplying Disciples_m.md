### M-Path Training

This set of Gospel stories are chosen to help an obedient disciple of Jesus become effective in multiplying disciples in a community.

# M1 Finding Apprentices

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

This is the first training in the M-Path: **M**ultiplying Disciples.

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of Apprenticeship then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Matthew 4:18-20 Follow Me

>   Matt 4:18-20 While walking by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus saw two brothers, Simon and Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” Immediately they left their nets and followed him.

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Jesus saw two brothers working hard at their trade.

Jesus offered a more rewarding "trade" – fishing for men, not just smelly fish!

Simon and Andrew were ordinary labourers, not educated leaders.

Simon and Andrew responded immediately and wholeheartedly.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

Anyone can become a disciple of Jesus.

Being made into a fisher of men requires an apprenticeship ("Follow me, and I will make you...)

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Jesus invites you to join with others in learning how to fish for men in God's Kingdom.

Will you become an apprentice and learn how to be a fisher of men?

Will you find two or three other believers and tell them that if they follow you, you will train them to become fishers of men (or church-planters, or missionaries)?

We want every believer to become a labourer in God's harvest field, so we ask you to find one man, one woman and one child to be your apprentices. It doesn't matter what their ages are relative to yours. Even a child can train two adults. All you need to be able to do is to obey what you learn and pass on what you learn to others.

## Luke 10:2 Ask the Lord to send workers into his harvest

>   Luke 10:2 Jesus said “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

God has prepared many people in this community to come into His Kingdom.

God needs people to labor with Him to bring in the harvest.

God urges us to pray earnestly to Him for laborers.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

This community is a ripe harvest field.

The harvest depends upon much earnest prayer – and obedient laborers.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you pray earnestly, every day, for God to raise up and send out laborers into this community?

Will you become an obedient apprentice labourer for this community?

Will you train up other apprentices to be obedient laborers in God's harvest?

# M2 Discovery Learning

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of Discovery then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Mark 4:34 He always taught them with Parables

>   Mark 4:34 He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.

## John 3:31-32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard.

>   John 3:31-32 Jesus said "The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. He testifies to what he has seen and heard."

## John 4:42 Now we have heard for ourselves

>   John 4:42 They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.”

## John 6:45 Everyone who has heard the Father comes to me.

>   John 6:45 Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Jesus always used stories (parables) to teach.

Jesus did not explain the parables unless people asked Him to.

Jesus explained the parables only to his disciples.

Our words are weak compared to the words of Jesus.

We teach what we think is true, Jesus says what He knows is true.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We should let Jesus speak through the bible into people's hearts and not use our words instead.

Jesus wants people to discover truth for themselves from the stories.

We must avoid telling people what to understand or what to believe.

When using stories for training we may need to help explain them.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you use bible stories to share the Gospel and train others?

Will you avoid preaching to others or telling them what they should learn?

Will you trust Jesus and let people discover truth for themselves?

When sharing bible stories, if you are asked what it means, will you share what the story means to you and what you think Jesus is saying to you and help others apply the story to themselves?

When you are training will you still let discovery happen, but if the teaching points do not emerge naturally then offer guidance to ensure that the training lesson is learnt?

# M3 Apprentice Growth Groups

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## John 4:1-2 It was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples

>   John 4:1-2 Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John— although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.

### What is *In* the Story?

Jesus had a rapidly growing number of disciples (not just the 12).

Jesus did not baptise the next-generation disciples.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

Jesus taught His disciples to make disciples and baptise them.

Everyone would have wanted Jesus to baptise them, but Jesus refused, because he needed to train them to multiply.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you teach your apprentices to go and make multiplying disciples?

Will you refuse to be the big-man who trains everyone?

## Disciple Making Movements

Jesus trained his disciples to start self-replicating movements of disciple makers wherever they went. As a consequence of this training the Kingdom of God grew very rapidly in the early decades of the church.

Over the last 20 years missionaries have rediscovered Jesus' disciple-making methods and applied them with incredible results. We are learning to obey what Jesus taught – and we are seeing the same rapid growth in His Kingdom. This approach is very different from traditional approaches to discipleship and church planting. We refer to Jesus' strategy as Disciple Making Movements (DMM).

## No Magic Formula

Before we start you must understand that the tools and training we teach are not a magic formula. Our "method" is no more than a collection of biblical tools which we pray the Holy Spirit will be able to use to make each of us into faithful disciples of Jesus. We have only one Master and only one Teacher – Jesus. So when you learn and apply this training, and when you train others, please emphasise that this is not a rigid unchangeable program, but a listening and learning journey for all of us. However, it is clear that Jesus' approach to discipleship is what, today, we would call an apprenticeship.

## Apprenticeships

Jesus trained three disciples in his inner circle (Luke 9:28) and twelve in his discipleship group (Luke 6:13). But He also sent out the seventy two (Luke 10:1) and at His death there were more than 500 disciples (1 Cor 15:6). So we try to follow the same pattern.

To do what Jesus did we need to stop thinking of the pastor as the leader or disciple-maker. If we are going to grow like yeast (Luke 13:20-21) then we must think and talk about every believer being a leader, a trainer, a church-planter. So we talk about apprentices and apprenticeships. In a Disciple-Making-Movement (DMM) everyone is both a trainer and an apprentice.

Jesus trained three disciples (Peter, James and John). Peter, James and John were apprentices to Jesus. But each of them trained three other disciples, so as well as being apprentices they were also trainers. This is what it looks like:

|                         | **Generation 1** | **Generation 2**      |
|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Jesus -\>               | Peter -\>        | three other disciples |
|                         | James -\>        | three other disciples |
|                         | John -\>         | three other disciples |
| **Total in Generation** | **3**            | **9**                 |

Jesus had twelve apprentices in two generations. Jesus chose all twelve but trained them in two generations. But it didn't stop there. It is quite clear that the twelve were active in training up other disciples (John 4:1-2). But it seems that Jesus advised the nine to train just two apprentices each. So the nine generation-2 disciples trained up 18, and the 18 trained two each which added another 36, and the 36 trained two each which brings us to the 72 disciples that Jesus sent out on mission in Luke 10.

|                  | **Gen 1** | **Gen 2**                   | **Gen 3**    | **Gen 4**    | **Gen 5** |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Jesus -\>        | Peter -\> | three other apprentices -\> | two each -\> | two each -\> | two each  |
|                  | James -\> | three other apprentices -\> | two each -\> | two each -\> | two each  |
|                  | John -\>  | three other apprentices -\> | two each -\> | two each -\> | two each  |
| **Total in Gen** | **3**     | **9**                       | **18**       | **36**       | **72**    |

We don't know for sure if this is how the 72 were trained, but it is a very reasonable guess and it serves as a suitable model for us to follow.

## Finding Apprentices

Like Jesus did, we aim to train three apprentices in each generation, but for new believers or young children two apprentices may be more appropriate. As a trainer, you should find three (or two) apprentices to train, and then help them to find their own apprentices. So, like Jesus, every trainer is giving care to two-generations. Your apprentices will also care for two-generations.

## Being an Apprentice

Peter, James and John were giving training to the other disciples at the same time that they were receiving training from Jesus; they were apprentices as well as trainers. They formed a special growth-group together, learning from each other and going on mission together (Mark 5:37), as well as learning from Jesus. So everyone giving training is also an apprentice. And every apprentice should also be a trainer.

## Apprentice Growth Groups (AGG)

During training, your apprentices should be in an Apprentice Growth Group (AGG) with their fellow apprentices (one or two others). AGG's work slightly differently from ordinary Growth Groups (GG) that we will teach later. The main difference is that a GG is for mutual discipleship and there is no "leader", but an AGG is for training so there is a trainer and apprentices.

Your role as a trainer is to help your apprentices see what Jesus put into the stories, what Jesus intended the story to teach us, and how Jesus wants us to obey it today. Your apprentices need to hear Jesus speaking to them through the stories and allow the stories to change their thinking, their priorities and their practice. We call this process Discovery which you learnt about in M02. Discovery is central to all our discipleship and training. Remember you are teaching obedience to Jesus, not a factory-line making identical robot disciple-makers.

To remind you of the slightly different approach between a GG and an AGG we use different questions; instead of the 4 GG questions we use:

1.  What is *In* the Story?
2.  What comes *Out* of the Story?
3.  How will I *Obey* the Story?

When training your AGG you guide the discovery process to ensure that the training lesson is learnt. You should still use Discovery, but if the teaching points do not emerge naturally, you ask questions and suggest interpretations to highlight the lesson.

## Training in an Apprentice Growth Group

When you gather your apprentices for their AGG you teach the training story and help them through the three AGG questions. If you have heard Jesus for yourself through the training story, you should be able to teach the story out of your own heart from memory. It is better to train out of your heart rather than from the training-guide. But if you need to, you can use the training-guide to remind you of the teaching-points from the story.

After the AGG discussion, each apprentice should feel confident that they can train their apprentices in the same story. You should give any assistance an apprentice needs to pass the training on (like Jesus, you train the three and help them train the nine.)

Likewise, each apprentice should be receiving help from two trainers: you and also your trainer. You are also an apprentice, so if you have a question or difficulty that your trainer cannot help with, you can simply ask their trainer. We see this kind of referring up the training path in John's gospel:

## John 12:20 Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus

>   John 12:20 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival. They came to Philip with a request. “Sir,” they said, “we would like to see Jesus.” Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.

(Philip did not need Andrew's permission to see Jesus – remember when the disciples tried to stop people going directly to Jesus, He told them off – See Luke 18:15-17)

## AGG Meeting

The structure of an AGG should come very naturally, but as a reminder you can think of Look-Back, Look-Up, Look-Forward. This is sometimes called a 3/3 group (three-thirds):

Look-Back:

1.  Each share any highlights or needs from the previous week.
2.  Each one should recite the previous week's training stories.
3.  Report and rejoice in each person's obedience to the previous AGG training.
4.  Report and rejoice in each person's passing on the previous AGG training to our apprentices.
5.  Briefly pray about what has been shared.

Look-Up: Teach the training story you have chosen.

Look-Forward:

1.  What is Jesus asking us to obey in the new training?
2.  Discuss any problems we anticipate in teaching the new training to our apprentices.
3.  Agree the topic, time and place for the next AGG.

# M4 Understanding the Training Stories

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of training through stories then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Mark 8:17-18 Are your hearts hardened? Do you have ears but fail to hear?

>   Mark 8:17-18 Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: “Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don’t you remember?"

## John 3:11 We speak of what we know

>   John 3:11 Jesus said, "Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony."

Tell the story and get people to retell it . Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Sometimes we hear or read a story but do not properly understand what Jesus means.

Jesus only taught what He knew from God and had seen Himself.

Some people won't even accept our own experience (testimony).

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We can only train using a story if we understand the story ourselves.

We may need help to understand Jesus' meaning.

The stories we tell need to become our stories – the things we have heard God speak to us in our hearts.

Teaching things that have not become our own story is ineffective.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you prayerfully study each training story you are taught and ask Jesus to give you revelation and a clear understanding of how the story applies to the teaching point? Without this your training will fail. The "How will I Obey the Story?" section will show you what the training-goal is. Make sure you can see how the bible story leads to these applications.

Will you put each training story into practice in your own life, so that it becomes your testimony?

Will you use your Apprentice-Growth-Group (AGG) to discuss the training story and get insight from the other members.

Will you ask your trainer and your trainer's trainer to help your understanding?

# M5 Selecting Training Stories

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of training through stories then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Mark 4:33-34 He always taught them with Parables

>   Mark 4:33-34 With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.

## John 5:39-40 You study the Scriptures diligently

>   John 5:39-40 You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.

Tell the story and get people to retell it . Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Jesus used many stories to teach – far more than is recorded in the gospels.

We need to come to Jesus through the stories – otherwise it is all pointless.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We need to choose stories that will help people come to Jesus and obey Him.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you pray for your apprentices that they will encounter Jesus through the stories?

Will you prayerfully select training stories that will help your apprentices grow in obedience to Jesus?

Will you ask Jesus to guide you to other bible stories that will help train your apprentices in obedience to Jesus?

If you find stories that work better for you or for those you are training, then use those instead.

Will you help us all become better trainers by sharing your experience with us? Please let us know what stories you find work well and which do not work well.

## Training Paths

Check on the website often, as we continue to develop our story-based training.

We have several training-paths:

### Multiplication-Tools (M-Path)

>   Luke 10:2 “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."

This path is for training believers to become labourers in the harvest field. This is the starting point for training Multiplying Disciples. You should teach each tool in this order.

The tools are:

1.  Finding Apprentices
2.  Discovery Learning
3.  Apprentice Growth Groups
4.  Understanding Training Stories
5.  Selecting Training Stories
6.  Growth Groups
7.  Story Telling
8.  Missional Communities
9.  Finding a Person-of-Peace
10. Discovery Groups
11. Go and Make Disciples
12. When it Breaks

### Go to the Nations (G-Path)

>   Matt 28:19 "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations..."

This path is to train you in going to other communities and other cultures with the Gospel.

1.  To the Ends of the Earth
2.  Pray for Workers
3.  Zero-Cost Mission
4.  Crossing Culture
5.  Heal the Sick
6.  Story Guardians

### Discipleship Landmarks (D-Path)

>   Matt 28:19-20 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

This path is help a person who has decided they want to follow Jesus to become a fruitful obedient disciple. The first four stories are quite challenging and should not be rushed. You may need to use stories from the Evangelism Path to help a person decide that they truly want to follow Jesus. After Repentance, it should not take very long to disciple the new believer through the rest of the path. As soon as possible the new believer should be encouraged to join an Apprentice Growth Group.

1.  Discovery
2.  Good Soil
3.  Only Jesus
4.  Repentance
5.  Baptism
6.  Baptism in the Spirit
7.  Peace with God
8.  Growth Group
9.  Prayer
10. Sharing your story
11. Healing and the Gospel of the Kingdom
12. Missional Communities
13. Multiplying Your Life

### New Wineskins (N-Path)

>   Luke 5:38-39 "New wine must be poured into new wineskins. And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, ‘The old is better.’”

>   Luke 16:15 He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight."

>   Mark 7:9 “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!"

This path is for challenging the traditional ways believers often think about church and disciple making to show us the Kingdom way of thinking. You can teach these stories in any order. If a pastor or apprentice has a struggle to accept one of the Multiplication-Tools, you can look for a story in this path that may help. If you are training people who are used to traditional churches you may need to teach some of these stories before you can start teaching the Multiplication-Tools.

This path includes stories for:

-   Relationship Hierarchies
-   Self-Replicating Ministry
-   Fruitless churches
-   Release or Control
-   Obedience Based Discipleship
-   Disciples not Members
-   Everyone a Church Planter
-   Who is the Teacher?
-   Discipleship DNA
-   Apprentice or Professor?
-   Leaderless Multiplication
-   Good News – not Condemnation
-   Breaking Bread with unbelievers

### Evangelism (E-Path)

>   Luke 19:10 "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”

This path is simply a growing set of Discovery-stories that can be used to let Jesus speak to unbelievers. We hope you will actively contribute to this collection from your experience in evangelism.

Conversion from another religion or African traditional culture.

Come to me

Finding Treasure

Mad, Bad or God

Do not prevent the children...

I am the light of the world

My peace

Lazarus and the Rich man.

Prodigal son.

### Catalysts (C-Path)

>   John 12:9 Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.

A catalyst is a small ingredient that makes a huge difference to the rate of growth. This path is a collection of individual ingredients that have been found to make a massive difference to the growth of a Disciple Making Movement. It is really important for the leading trainer in any network of apprentices to study and apply these stories. They will want to ensure that these lessons are applied throughout the disciple-making-movement. These stories can be taught in any order and at any time.

-   Monitoring / reporting progress
-   Extraordinary prayer (personal & GG)
-   New-wine fasting & prayer walking
-   Zero-Cost Mission
-   Creativeness and Adapting to Needs
-   Listening to Feedback and Sharing Experiences
-   Young mobile disciples
-   Women and Children Leaders
-   Cultural Songs and Stories
-   Training Hubs

# M6 Growth Group Training

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of a GG then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Matthew 18:20 Where two or three gather

>   Matthew 18:20 "Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."

## John 16:13 The Spirit of truth will guide you

>   John 16:13 "The Spirit of truth will guide you into all the truth."

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Discuss what you think is good about this story?

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

What is Jesus teaching you from this story?

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you find one or two friends and agree to meet regularly to listen to Jesus through the bible stories?

Will you expect Jesus to teach you?

## Luke 6:46-49 Wise and Foolish Builders

>   Luke 6:46-49 “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say? As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the sand. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

People love to hear about God.

People are not so keen to obey!

People think that maturity as a disciple is about learning more truth.

Jesus says what counts is obedience, not knowledge.

### What comes Out of the Story?

We need to measure discipleship and maturity by obedience, not knowledge.

Only obedience to Jesus pleases God.

Obedience makes us strong, disobedience makes us weak.

### How will I Obey the Story?

Will you agree to meet regularly in a Growth Group to listen to AND OBEY what Jesus teaches you?

## Luke 11:34-36 The Lamp of the Body

>   Luke 11:34-36 “Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness. See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.”

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

What does Jesus mean when he says "the light **within** you"? What kind of light is that?

### What comes Out of the Story?

How could a **part** of your body be in darkness?

What parts of a person's life might be hidden in darkness?

### How will I Obey the Story?

Will you agree to let Jesus' light enter every part of your life?

Will you share your inner life in your Growth Group so that you can support and pray for each other?

## Growth Groups

In obedience to the stories above, a Growth Group (GG) is two or three[^1] people who meet regularly (usually once or twice a week) to learn from Jesus, love each other and share in an adventure of faith. If any member is not yet a Christian, consider including more unbelievers and run your group as a Discovery Group.

[^1]: Where there are four or more people, some can easily become spectators.

### Four Questions

When the Growth Group meets, you start by reading (or telling) the bible story you have chosen. Each person should then repeat the story from memory in their own words to make sure everyone understands what they have heard. Then each person should share in discussing these four questions:

1.  What does this tell us about people's character or nature?
2.  What does this tell us about Jesus or God?
3.  What does Jesus want to say to me personally?
4.  Who does Jesus want me to share this story with?

Then take turns to pray for each one in the group, and for your Missional Community and other outreach.

Agree on the story for the next meeting. Between meetings pray over the next story every day and see what Jesus says to you, ready for your next meeting.

### GG Advice

Do NOT preach! Members should not preach or teach other members. We must help each other listen to Jesus and discover for themselves.

Go at the pace that suits your group. Do not wear people out with difficult passages or long meetings (1½ hours is a usual GG length). You do not need to understand everything, just leave out passages you find difficult.

A good place to start is going through the Discipleship Landmarks stories[^2]. After that work your way slowly through Luke's Gospel[^3] and then John, Mark and Matthew before moving on to other parts of the bible. We recommend you return to at least one of the Gospels each year.

[^2]: See https://life-for-liberia.netlify.app/teaching/multiplying-disciples/discipleship-landmarks/

[^3]: Luke is the best story-teller. John provides lots of application, Mark is full of action, Matthew provides a bit of everything. This suggested order is our recommendation for all new GG's .

Include small children in a family group. Children who can read can be in their own group – let them ask for help if they want it. Older children may need reminding not to preach or be bossy to younger children.

GG's must be free from the control of church leaders. They can decide when, where and how often they meet and what stories they discuss. They can disband and form new GG's if they choose to.

# M7 Story Telling Training

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## Luke 7:36-50 Simon's Dinner Party

>   Luke 7:36-50 When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.

>   When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.” Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” “Tell me, teacher,” he said.

>   “Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred dollars, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?” Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.” "You have judged correctly,” Jesus said. Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.” Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”

1.  Tell the group they are going to learn the story word-for-word, so they must pay attention.
2.  Read the story to the group **twice**.
3.  Asks lots of questions about the story details – let anyone answer.
4.  Read the story again.
5.  Get one person to tell the story back (you can use gestures as prompts). Ask the group to correct any mistakes that are made as it being told. If the group does not notice a mistake, you should correct it.
6.  Ask if anything was added or left out when the story was retold.
7.  Continue with this practice until everyone has retold the story.
8.  Get the group to act out the story. Have fun – but make sure the story is told exactly.
9.  Help the group to discuss the story. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Jesus is sharing a meal with Simon, who is an unbeliever in Simons house.

A sinful woman was drawn to Jesus.

The Simon thinks that Jesus should not let the sinner-woman near him.

Jesus tells Simon a story and asks him what he learns from it.

Jesus applies the story to Simon and the sinner woman.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We should socialise with unbelievers so we can share Jesus.

We should look for opportunities to share bible stories that are relevant to the situation.

We should ask questions to help the listeners interpret the story themselves instead of telling them what it means.

We should help the person see how the story applies to them.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Why do you think Jesus told Simon a story instead of just telling him off for being judgemental?

Discuss what you think the benefits of story-telling could be compared with normal preaching. Try to come up with as many benefits as you can. (e.g. people who cannot read, more engaging, less confrontational, deeply challenging, easy to pass on, gathers a crowd, adaptable to different cultures, memorable so the Holy Spirit can keep working through the story for days, weeks and months after it was shared.)

Will you use bible stories to help people discover bible truth for themselves?

## Finding a Good Doctor

This is NOT a bible story!

You have a pain in your stomach which won't go away. You go to a doctor and he takes you into his consulting room and without even asking you what is wrong, he take a medicine off his desk and gives it to you, saying "Take this" and he sends you away. Will you go back to that doctor?

So you go to another doctor. This one asks you what your symptoms are and listens carefully to you. Then he opens his medicine cabinet, but there is only one medicine there. He gives it to you, saying "Take this" and he sends you away. Will you go back to that doctor?

So you go to another doctor. This one asks you what your symptoms are and listens carefully to you. Then he opens his medicine cabinet, and there are many medicines there. He reads the labels and looks them up in his book and eventually selects one. He gives it to you, saying "Take this" and he sends you away. Will you go back to that doctor?

What do you need to do to become a good story-teller?

## No Experts

We must not allow the trainer or anyone else to appear like an expert with special knowledge.

During story discussion, if anyone tries to teach anything that is not found in the story, ask "Where is that in the story?" or if anyone asks a question that cannot be answered from the story say, "The story doesn't tell us".

If the point being discussed came up in a previous story the group has learnt you should remind them of that story. Or if the point is important, but hasn't yet been covered, you can teach the bible story that does answer the question (you may suggest you teach it at the next meeting).

## Story Telling Suggestions

-   If you do not have time to teach the bible story by heart, then read it twice and ask the detail-questions. Then go on to the discovery discussion.
-   Change **minor** details to suit the culture (e.g. local names or places, local food e.g. cassava instead of bread, local idioms, easier words). Do not change things just because you don't like them, or you do not understand them or because they are culturally offensive.
-   See "G4 Crossing Culture" for guidance on translating stories into the local dialect.
-   See "G6 Story Guardians" for guidance on teaching stories or training to oral cultures, and teaching many stories in a short time.

# M8 Missional Community Training

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of a MC then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Matthew 5:13-16 Salt and Light

>   Matthew 5:13-16 “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."

Tell the story and get people to retell it . Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Who do you think Jesus is talking to? (Only the 12 original disciples? Or only church leaders? Or every believer?)

Who should benefit from the salt and the light? (Only church-goers? Only other believers? Everyone in our community?)

Who is the salt and the light? (Only Jesus? Jesus seen in our lives?)

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

How can Christians lose their saltiness? (Being disobedient to Jesus; not loving others; getting involved in arguments; being harsh to their partners or children; being legalistic Christians; ignoring the needs of their community).

How can Christians hide their light? (Hiding away in church buildings and church services; not befriending their neighbours; not telling their community about Jesus)

How can Christians be salt and light in their community? (Get involved in improving the community; helping those in need; loving those who are without friends; start DG's, GG's and MC's)

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you be obedient to Jesus?

Will you move the salt and light out of church and into the community?

What will you do to be salt and light in your community?

What specific needs are there within your community that you and other believers could help with?

Missional Communities are a biblical way to get involved in your community so that you can multiply obedient disciples of Jesus. Will you start a Missional Community with your neighbours?

## Luke 5:29-32 Levi's Dinner Party

>   Luke 5:29-32 Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”

Tell the story and get people to retell it . Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Where did Jesus go to make disciples? (A home in the community, NOT church!)

What kind of people were there? (Sinners, NOT church members)

What sort of event was it? (A meal, not a church service or a bible study)

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

How does this compare with usual church practices?

Which approach do you think is likely to be more effective in multiplying disciples?

Who are the "sinners" in your community that others reject or avoid? (Drunks, drug-addicts, trouble-makers, Muslims, witch-doctors, followers of traditional religions...)

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you follow Jesus' example?

Will you move disciple-making out of church and into the community?

Will you host a meal and invite your neighbours – even those who are rejected as sinners?

This is what Missional Communities try to do.

## Luke 22:10-20 The Lord's Supper

>   Luke 22:10-20 Jesus said, “As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’ He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.” They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.

>   When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. And he said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.” After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.” And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you."

### What is *In* the Story?

Where did Jesus share the Lord's Supper? (A house, not a church)

What kind of event was this? (A meal, not a church service)

How much do you think they ate and drank? (Enough to fill them, not just tiny nibbles)

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

How does Jesus' meal compare with "breaking bread" in church?

What difference do you think it could make to celebrate the Lord's Supper in a house instead of in church?

What difference do you think it could make to celebrate the Lord's Supper as a meal instead of a church service?

What difference do you think it could make to celebrate the Lord's Supper eating a full meal instead of just tiny nibbles?

Do you remember the story of Levi's Dinner Party? Could you use a Lord's Supper meal to introduce Jesus to unbelievers?

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you follow Jesus' example?

Will you move the Lord's Supper out of church and into the community?

Will you host a meal with your neighbours and celebrate Jesus' life, death and resurrection?

This is what Missional Communities try to do.

## Luke 18:15-17 Let the little children come

>   Luke 18:15-17 People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”

Tell the story and get people to retell it . Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Why do you think the people wanted Jesus to place his hands on their babies?

Why do you think the disciples rebuked them?

In what way do you think the kingdom of God belongs to young children?

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

How are children treated in your church compared with this story?

How are children treated in your community compared with this story?

Are your children brought to Jesus Himself, to develop their own relationship with Him?

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you follow Jesus' example?

Will you lay hands on, and pray for, the little children in your community?

Will you welcome the children into your community meals and tell them about Jesus?

Will you start GG's for children?

This is what Missional Communities try to do.

## Missional Community

The stories above have given you the basic ingredients of a Mission Community

-   Gathering your neighbours to a meal, celebrating Jesus' life, death and resurrection.
-   Welcoming "sinners" and children.
-   Discussing and planning ways to bless and improve your community.
-   Starting up GG's for the members of the community, including the children.

Here are some other suggestions:

-   Before the meal, tell a bible story.
-   During the meal encourage people to discuss the story.
-   Towards the end of the meal, remind people that you are celebrating Jesus life, death and resurrection, and His presence with you today. Raise your cups to Jesus. Someone can pray a prayer of thanks to Jesus and blessing on the gathering.
-   After the meal start discussing community needs and plan how the group can take action to help.
-   If you have unbelievers present, ask them how they think God may be working in their own lives. Ask them what they can do to cooperate with God and suggest they join a Discovery Group.
-   How can your MC multiply? Is everyone in a GG? Can your MC start a Discovery Group? Or launch another MC nearby or in another community?
-   Before you end, plan when and where you will have your next MC gathering (aim to meet every week).

# M9 Finding a Person-of-Peace

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## Luke 10:5-7 The Person of Peace

>   Luke 10:5-7 “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house."

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Go out looking for people of peace, and enter their houses (or courtyards).

Offer peace to the house.

Accept hospitality and eat what is offered to us.

Do not move around from house to house.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We should try to share the Gospel with groups of people not just individuals.

We should focus on one receptive family or group and try to go to everyone.

Let people welcome us into their space and relationships, rather than us trying to get them to come into ours.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you go out looking for households or groups of people you can share Good News with?

Will you start by offering peace and blessing from God to the people?

Will you try to enter their world and accept their hospitality rather than be like a stranger trying to judge or change them?

Will you stay and give time for a relationship to develop, rather than rushing away to tell others?

## John 4:4-42 Woman at the Well

Note: This is by far the longest story in our training paths. It is so full of good instruction that it is well worth teaching it. Each community or group will need to work out their own ways of learning the story. They could act it out, or write songs, or draw pictures or collect objects to help them remember it. Or they could record it being read on their phones.

There are many things we can learn from Jesus through this story, and you should share and discuss the story often.

For the purpose of this training we will restrict our discussion to **finding a person of peace**.

>   John 4:6 Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon. When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Will you give me a drink?” (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.” “Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?”

>   Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”

>   He told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.” “I have no husband,” she replied. Jesus said to her, “You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.” “Sir,” the woman said, “I can see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.” “Woman,” Jesus replied, “believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.” The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.” Then Jesus declared, “I, the one speaking to you—I am he.”

>   Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?” Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?” They came out of the town and made their way toward him.

>   Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.” But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” Then his disciples said to each other, “Could someone have brought him food?” “My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. Don’t you have a saying, ‘It’s still four months until harvest’? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. Thus the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true. I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.”

>   Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.” So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. And because of his words many more became believers. They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.”

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

How did Jesus discover if the woman was spiritually open?

Why was the woman (and the disciples) surprised that Jesus asked for water?

What did Jesus do about this cultural barrier? (He crossed over to her culture rather than demanding she conform to His).

How did Jesus introduce a spiritual conversation? (He connected a natural need (thirst) with a spiritual need.)

How did Jesus try to turn this into a group-encounter instead of just talking to one individual? (Go and call your husband, and eventually she called the whole town)

How did the woman try to turn the conversation away from her personal life? (She raised a cultural disagreement)

How did Jesus deal with this attempt to start an argument? (He spoke our personal responsibility to God in true worship)

What shows that this was a "woman of peace"? (She went and told the whole town!)

Why did Jesus speak to the disciples about the harvest? (The person of peace is God's strategy for reaping the harvest).

What did Jesus say had already happened before the harvest? (Others had done the hard work).

How did Jesus respond to the welcome he received?

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

Jesus went searching for a person of peace (like he told the disciple to go... in Luke 10).

He asked for water and accepted what she gave, despite it being against his own culture (Like Luke 10:6)

Jesus made connections between their common natural need (water) and God's provision of spiritual refreshment (the Spirit).

Jesus asked her to bring others from her community.

Jesus avoided impersonal arguments and turned it back to her relationship with God.

Jesus uses the incident to train his disciples in the person-of-peace for reaping the harvest.

Jesus shows us that sowing and watering is necessary before the harvest.

Jesus stayed where he was welcome, rather than quickly going to the next pace.

The towns people believed because they heard from Jesus Himself.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you search and pray for people of peace?

Will cross over cultural barriers to connect with others?

Will you ask individuals to invite their family, friends and community leaders to hear about Jesus?

Will you search for common ground and avoid arguments?

Will you stay and persist in developing friendship and trust once you find a welcome?

Will you invite the group to host a Discovery Group in their home / community?

# M10 Discovery Group Training

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

If people have difficulty accepting the idea of Discovery then use appropriate stories from the "New Wineskins" N-path.

## Luke 8:4-8 The Four Soils

>   Luke 8:4-8 While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.” When he said this, he called out, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”

>   John 6:45 It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

A crowd of people were curious about Jesus.

Jesus told the people a story.

The story was about the different ways people respond to Jesus' words.

Some of the people had ears to hear God speak to them through the story.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

Stories are Jesus' way of reaching out to unbelievers.

Stories can be told to groups of people.

The stories allow people to respond in their own way.

Those who hear God speak to them through the story will come to Jesus.

Some of the hearers will become fruitful disciples.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you try to find groups of people to tell Bible stories to?

Will you allow the people to discuss the stories and discover their meaning for themselves?

Will you help people to apply those stories to themselves?

Will you trust God to speak through the stories into people's hearts.

## John 3:10-11 You are Israel’s teacher

>   John 3:10-11 Jesus said “You are Israel’s teacher, and do you not understand these things? Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony."

Tell the story and get people to retell it. Help the group to discuss the stories. Help them to see the points and applications below.

### What is *In* the Story?

Leaders in any community have a responsibility to try and understand the things of God.

Jesus spent time teaching spiritually open leaders.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

We should help community leaders recognise their God-given responsibility to understand the truth.

We should help them listen to Jesus through the bible.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?

Will you try to persuade community and religious leaders to let you lead a Discovery Group in their home?

## Discovery Group

The stories above have given you the basic ingredients of a Discovery Group – telling and discussing Bible stories to groups of people and letting them discover what Jesus is saying to them.

Here are some other suggestions:

-   Groups of 4-12 people is ideal. Start more groups if more people are interested.
-   Base the group in the community, not in a church building.
-   Use the Story-Telling training to learn how to tell the stories.
-   Use the GG training to learn the 4 questions to ask.
-   Invite the Discovery Group to become a Missional Community as soon as you can.
-   Look on the website for suggested Discovery Group stories.

# M11 Go and Make Disciples

## Matthew 28:18-20 Go and make disciples of all nations

>   Matt 28:18-20 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

He commands us to Go.

He commands us to Make disciples.

He commands us to Baptise disciples.

He commands us to teach disciples to Obey.

### What comes *Out* of the Story?

Jesus' authority gives us authority to make disciples.

We should make disciples where they are, not invite people to come to church to be discipled.

We should make disciples, not just church members.

We should make disciples in all nations, all counties, all communities.

### How will I *Obey* the Story?
