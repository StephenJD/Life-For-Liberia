**Listening To Jesus**

**L-Path Training**

### Summary

Jesus has called us to do the impossible and make disciples of all the nations. The only way we can do this is by listening to and obeying Jesus. No training manual or book – even the bible itself, is sufficient. We must be listen to and obey the Holy Spirit that Jesus has given us. We must learn to Listen to Jesus.

# L1 – Called to be Fruitful

**Aim**: To become a truly prophetic people who hear and obey our extraordinary Lord.

## John 15:5,8 Bear Much Fruit

>   John 15:5,8 Jesus said, “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing … This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.”

## John 15:16 Chosen to bear much lasting fruit

>   John 15:16 Jesus said, “You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you.”

What big dreams is Jesus encouraging you to dream through these promises?

What risks are you prepared to take to make these dreams a reality?

Where do you need to “be” if you are to see these promises become true in your life?

# L2 – Eating and Drinking Jesus

## John 6:56-57 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me

>   John 6:56-57 Jesus said, “Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.”

Food becomes a part of us and sustains our efforts.

How can you “eat His flesh and drink His blood” and “feed on Him”?

What do you have to do with food for it to become part of you? - Prepare it, put it in your mouth, chew it, swallow it, digest it, use its strength.

What are the equivalent steps to feeding on Jesus?

What preparation do you need to do? Perhaps booking out some quiet time, finding a quiet place, turning your phone off…

How would you “put it in your mouth”? – perhaps read it a few times to make sure you understand the words and its basic meaning.

How would you “chew it”?

What might “swallow it” mean? Perhaps memorising the scripture you are meditating on.

How would you “digest” the scripture?

How would you “use its strength”?

# L3 – Let Jesus have Authority

## John 6:60 Who can accept it?

>   John 6:60,66 On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?” … From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.

Are you willing to hear and accept Jesus’ hard sayings?

Jesus lived according to Kingdom culture and that often clashed with his native culture.

Are you prepared to courageously obey Jesus and walk in the Kingdom, even where it is contrary to your culture?

# L4 – Humility before Jesus

## Luke 18:9-14 I thank you that I am not like other people

>   Luke 18:9-14 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”

It is all too easy for us to become like this Pharisee. We assume we are already living in obedience and think that anything we read in scripture is for other people, not us!

Through familiarity with the Gospels we can easily become deaf to Jesus! We can nod in recognition of the familiar stories without letting them speak to us deeply. We have defences against the words that challenge the status quo.

Will you prayerfully listen to Jesus in this story and see if you sometimes react like this Pharisee?

# L5 – One Thing is Needful

## Luke 10:38-41 Mary and Martha

>   Luke 10:38-41 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”

>   “Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”

What is Jesus saying to you through this incident?

Martha felt more comfortable serving Jesus rather than listening to him. Many people feel like that.

Doing things can give us a greater sense of achievement than listening.

Listening can seem threatening if we are afraid that we may not hear anything.

What does Jesus want to say to you about this?

Do you have any worries that distract you or hinder you from listening to Jesus?

Our primary need is to sit with and listen to Jesus. Discipleship is not about teaching people good doctrine, or good behaviour. It is teaching people to listen to Jesus. Everything else flows naturally from that.

What does Jesus want you to do about this?

-   In your own devotional life?
-   In your own Growth Group?
-   In your leadership role?
-   In your discipling of others?
-   In your church?

# L6 – Learn from Jesus

## Matt 11:28-30 Walk with me and learn from me

>   Matt 11:28-30 "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Walk with me and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my way is easy and my burden is light.”

Who needs to learn from Jesus?

(I hope you answered “Me” and not “Everyone else!”. See L4)

How do you put this invitation into practice personally?

I cannot listen for you, or teach you, or feed you.

I may be able to bring you to Jesus, and show you what He says, and show you how I obey him. But you must hear for yourself and learn from Him. That is what Jesus said.

The main way I listen to Jesus and learn from Him is to memorise and meditate on Jesus’ words. I often spend days or even weeks or months going over the same passage. Praying and listening and asking Jesus to speak deeply into my heart.

Walking and learning also includes obedience. We learn from Jesus as we go out in obedience, loving, healing, sharing, praying.

If “doing” is a distraction for some that stops them listening, then for others, “Listening” is an excuse to never “do”. Jesus made it clear in the story of the wise and foolish builders (see D3) that those who hear but do not “do” are not His disciples.

What would Jesus say to those who think we should spend as much time as possible at church in prayer meetings and bible studies?

What does Jesus want to say to you about walking with Him?

# L7 – My Sheep Hear My Voice

## John 10:27-28 My sheep listen to my voice

>   John 10:27-28 Jesus said, “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand.”

Jesus makes a simple statement of fact: “My sheep listen to my voice”. It is the consequence of being Born Again and filled with the Holy Spirit. If you are in Jesus, you will listen to His voice. So just believe it and practice it!

Jesus does speak to you, and you do hear and listen. Do you recognise that fact?

Do you give special attention to listening to Jesus?

Do you expect to hear Jesus speak to you?

I hope you have found this training path has helped you to really listen carefully to Jesus, especially when He wants to say something unexpected, or challenging to you.

Listening, hearing and obeying is a practice and a journey we are all on. Jesus walks it with us. Have faith, never give up. Have joy and peace in believing.
