### What is "Kingdom Apprentices"?

Find us at [Kingdom-Apprentices.net](https://kingdom-apprentices.net/)

"Kingdom Apprentices" is a Disciple-Making Movement to raise up fruitful and obedient disciples of Jesus, transforming lives and whole communities.

Using the same methods that Jesus used, we teach simple Gospel stories and invite people to discuss them and listen to, and obey, what Jesus wants to say to them. The impact of this simple approach has been truly transformative.

This introduction takes the same approach, so we invite you to read the gospel stories carefully and prayerfully and ask Jesus what He wants to say to you through them.

# I1 Kingdom Apprentices

This is the first training in the I-Path: **I**ntroducing Kingdom Apprentices.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 28:18-20 Go and Make Disciples

>   Matthew 28:18-20 Jesus said “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

What good news is in this story?

What does Jesus want to say to you through this story?

### Some questions

Approximately how many people usually attend your church services?

How many of these do you think Jesus would describe as His disciples?

"Kingdom Apprentices" came about because we realised that although we could run churches, we were ineffective in raising up obedient disciples.

# I2 How Does Someone Become A Disciple?

This is the second training in the I-Path: **I**ntroducing Kingdom Apprentices.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## John 6:45 Everyone who has heard the Father comes to me

>   Jesus said, "Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me."

What good news is in this story?

What does Jesus want to say to you through this story?

### Some questions

Looking ONLY at this one verse:

How does Jesus describe a disciple in this verse?

How does that person become a disciple? (answer just from this verse)

So what do you need to do to make a disciple? (answer just from this verse)

Now, think about your own growth as a disciple. What has really changed you? Hearing other people tell you about Jesus, or hearing Jesus speak to you?

But what methods do we use to try and make disciples?

Can you see why we are so ineffective at making disciples?

Kingdom-Apprentices make disciples the way Jesus said to do it.

# I3 Knowledge without Obedience

This is the third training in the I-Path: **I**ntroducing Kingdom Apprentices.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 6:46-49 Wise & Foolish Builders

>   Luke 6:46-49 Jesus said “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say? Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the sand. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”

### Some questions

People come every week to church and hear about Jesus. Because they go to church they call Jesus "Lord". Does learning lots about Jesus make you a disciple? (Answer just from this story).

When we welcome people to church each week, preach to them and then send them home with a smile, we are training them. It is not our words that train them, it is the habit of going to church that trains them. They become church-goers. Is that what Jesus commanded us to do?

What kind of people are you training if you teach lots about Jesus, but forget to make sure they are being obedient?

People need to be taught how to obey Jesus. It does not come naturally. They need to be taught how to read the bible, especially the gospels, how to listen to Jesus speaking to them through the Holy Spirit, how to believe and trust Him and how to do what He says to do. This is what Kingdom-Apprentices do.

# I4 Two Sons

This is the fourth training in the I-Path: **I**ntroducing Kingdom Apprentices.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 21:28-31 A Man who had Two Sons

>   Matthew 21:28-31 Jesus said, "There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’ ‘I will not,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went. Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go. Which of the two did what his father wanted?” “The first,” they answered.

What good news is in this story?

What does Jesus want to say to you through this story?

### Some questions

We all know people like these sons. Some are slow and reluctant to respond, but later change their mind. Others are full of enthusiasm but then never do what they said.

Which of the two types of people are more enjoyable to teach?

Which of the two are more fruitful?

Perhaps you are very fortunate to have people who are both enthusiastic to respond and also faithful in obedience.

Which of these types would Jesus describe you as?

Kingdom-Apprentices work with people who are faithful to obey Jesus.

# I5 Overturned Tables

This is the fifth training in the I-Path: **I**ntroducing Kingdom Apprentices.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 21:12 Jesus overturned the tables

>   Matthew 21:12 Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.

What good news is in this story?

What does Jesus want to say to you through this story?

### Some questions

If you had been standing in the temple at that time when Jesus did this, would you be shocked? Or offended? Or amazed? Or glad?

What do you think would have gone through your mind?

Thinking about your own church and your church services, are there any "tables" you think Jesus may want to overturn?

Kingdom-Apprentices are not afraid to turn over a few tables, and are not upset when Jesus turns our tables over. We serve Jesus, not our traditions.

# I6 Whose authority?

This is the sixth training in the I-Path: **I**ntroducing Kingdom Apprentices.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 21:23-25 By what authority are you doing these things?

>   Matthew 21:23-25 Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. “By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you this authority?” Jesus replied, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. John’s baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?”

>   What good news is in this story?

What does Jesus want to say to you through this story?

### Conclusion

The chief priests asked a very good question! Any time someone new turns up and starts preaching or teaching we should ask the same question: "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"

When someone starts turning over tables, you want to know who gave them the authority!

We believe we come in Jesus Name and with His authority, but you must be the judge of that.

We do not want to take your church from you, or take control of your church, or ask you for money, or teach some strange doctrines or get you to join our movement.

But we want to be honest and clear with you. Like Jesus, we want to turn over some tables, do a little teaching and healing and then leave. What happens next is up to you. If you conclude that we are helping you to hear and obey Jesus, then we will be happy to share more with you.

### Why "apprentices" instead of "disciples"?

We call obedient disciples of Jesus "apprentices" because it requires practical hand-on experience and practice, and our training takes place in the community on real mission, not in the church classroom.

We train in small groups, teach Gospel stories, and help our apprentices to hear Jesus speak to them and practice their obedience to Him. We train our apprentices to immediately start training up their own apprentices.

Our training is not a magic formula or a rigid unchangeable program, but a listening and learning journey for all of us. It is simply a collection of Gospel stories which we pray the Holy Spirit will be able to use to make each of us into faithful disciples of Jesus. We have only one Master and only one Teacher – Jesus.

Jesus is sending Kingdom-Apprentices to other communities and nations to train obedient disciples who will also go. That is why we would like to come to you and share what Jesus has taught us about making disciples.
