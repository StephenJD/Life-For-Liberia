### E-Path Training

This set of Gospel stories are chosen to help people to see how relevant Jesus is to their lives.

We recommend you use D1 and D2 stories for initial evangelism. But you may feel that other stories are more appropriate initially. The Evangelism Path suggests numerous other stories you might consider.

It is up to you to pray through these stories and see what ideas the Holy Spirit gives you.

Feel free to discuss in the WhatsApp group or through the contact form how any of these stories could be used.

# E1 For Community / Religious Leaders

This is part of the E-Path: **E**vangelism Stories.

Motto: **Love one another – Go and make disciples**

## Luke 9:23

Luke 9:23 Jesus said “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it. What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self?"

## Luke 11:46

>   Luke 11:46 Jesus said “And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them."

## Luke 12:2

>   Luke 12:2 Jesus said "There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs. I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him."

## Luke 16:13-15

>   Luke 16:13-15 Jesus said “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money (or Poro/Sande).” The Pharisees (Poro priests), who loved money (Poro/Sande), heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight."

## 2 Corinthians 6:14

>   2 Corinthians 6:14 Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.” Therefore, “Come out from them and be separate," says the Lord.

## John 15:15-16 Friendship with God

The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

## Luke 8:43 A Woman Healed

>   Luke 8:43 And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. “Who touched me?” Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.” But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.” Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”

>   Luke 5:27 After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him. Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”
