As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. At this the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’ The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go. But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ he demanded. His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.’ But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened. Then the master called the servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said, ‘I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?’ In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed. This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”

This is the twelfth training in the P-Path: **P**rayer.

Much of the popular teaching about spiritual warfare is contrary to what we see in Jesus ministry and teaching. Let us learn from Jesus.

## Matthew 4:1-11 Jesus led by the Spirit to be tempted

>   Matthew 4:1-11 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written: ‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’” Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’” Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour. “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship me.” Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’” Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.

## Ephesians 6:10-12 Our Struggle Is Not Against Flesh And Blood

>   Ephesians 6:10-12 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armour of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Even though "our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but ... against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms." we overcome evil, as Jesus did, by standing firm in the truth, and as the disciples did, by healing and delivering people in the authority of Jesus. Jesus never told us to rebuke or bind Satan or his schemes – only God can do that (see Jude 1:8-10).

Will you wage war with prayer, love, truth, faith and obedience?

# P13 Listen To Jesus

This is the thirteenth training in the P-Path: **P**rayer.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## John 5:39-40 Study Scripture then Listen...

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Studying scripture is how God starts a conversation with you. Will you then ask Him what He wants to say to you and listen carefully?

Even Jesus' closest disciples had hard hearts and deaf ears! Are you able to recognise that your heart is also hard? Pray for a soft, attentive, willing heart.

Will you listen quietly and carefully to Jesus today – and obey Him?

Sometimes physical quiet and stillness is the way for you to listen to Jesus. Other times it may be through physical activity like walking or running, or dancing or weeding or digging... Learn and practice what works for you to calm your mind and listen to Jesus. Jesus' transfiguration took place after the hard physical exercise of climbing a mountain! Find what works for you.

## Luke 18:1-8 God is Not Like an Unjust Judge

>   Luke 18:1-8 Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’ For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’ And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”

He often falls into the fire or into the water. I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.” “You unbelieving and perverse generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.” Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment. Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” He replied, “Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”
