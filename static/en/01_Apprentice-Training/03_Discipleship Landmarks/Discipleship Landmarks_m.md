# Using this Training

## Discipleship Landmarks Training

A Kingdom-Apprentice is a fruitful, confident and obedient disciple of Jesus who is committed to fulfilling Jesus’ command to make multiplying disciples. Our DNA is **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply**.

This training is designed to be used by any kind of group, including on-line groups. It can also be used by an individual. D5 describes Discovery Groups and Growth Groups.

The first few trainings include some stories from surahs in the Quran for use with Muslim groups. You can omit these for Christian groups.

Use Surah 5:46 (if inviting a Muslim) and Matthew 11:28-30 from D1 to invite people to start a group. At the first group meeting use the next D1 story (Acts 26:18).

## Learning The Stories

We strongly recommend that both the trainer and group members learn the stories by heart so Jesus can keep speaking to you through them. Most stories can easily be learnt word-perfect, but for the longer stories, being able to retell the story in your own words is sufficient.

Use a modern easy to read bible, not the King James!

If any members do not have a bible or cannot read, you can read the passage out loud and let the members record it on their phones.

Whenever you teach a story, if it is something Jesus said, start it with "Jesus said: ". That way the person learning will know that these are the words of Jesus.

Use actions to help people remember the story. Get the members to copy your actions.

Recite the story from memory twice and then say to the group, "**Tell me the same story**".

For a longer story, use this learning tool:

-   Get the members to say every detail they noticed in the story.
-   If they miss anything ask questions to see if they remember the detail.
-   Recite the story from memory twice more.
-   Say, "**Tell me the same story**" until they have got it right.

## 4 Group Rules

These Group Rules have been found to be essential for happy and fruitful groups. Whenever starting any kind of new group, share these Group Rules with the members:

### 1. No Church!

We are not wanting to start a church, or get anyone to start going to church, or to leave their church or mosque.

We are just sharing Jesus stories, so people can become better Christians or Muslims.

### 2. No Preaching Allowed

Members should not preach or teach other members. If people want to hear preaching they can go to church or the mosque!

Each person can share what they think, and no-one should try to correct them or say they are wrong. We do not meet to argue with each other, but to listen to and learn from each other and from Jesus. Children’s groups may need help and reminding not to preach or be bossy to younger children.

### 3. Answer only from the passage

When discussing a passage we ask you to limit your answers to what is in the chosen passage. If people start quoting other scripture, or what they have read or heard from other places, they will sound like an expert and put off those who do not have that depth of knowledge. We need to learn from Jesus, not from our traditions.

### 4. Go at your own speed

There is much that Jesus can teach us through each of these stories, and sufficient time and attention should be given to each story, before moving on to the next. If you progress too quickly without ensuring that the hearers are being obedient to what they are learning, you will train them to be disobedient! They will think that hearing or understanding is all that matters, and that obedience is optional.

Do not wear people out with difficult passages or long meetings (1½ hours is a usual meeting length). You do not need to understand everything, just leave out passages or stories you find too difficult.

Each group must be free to decide when, where and how often they meet and what stories they discuss. They can disband and form new groups if they choose to.

## Questions

Remember, *No Preaching Allowed*! Instead we ask questions to help each person Listen, Obey and Multiply.

#### Listening Questions

Start with Listening questions, like:

-   What do you like about this story?
-   What do you think about this part of the story...?"
-   What good news is in this story?

If the members engage well with these questions, we can try digging a bit deeper with:

-   What does this tell us about people's nature (or character)?
-   What does this tell us about Jesus or God’s nature?

#### Obedience Questions

Once people have thought about the detail of the story, ask Obedience questions, like:

-   What does Jesus want to say to you personally through this story?
-   How will you obey?

It is usually easy to think how a story applies to other people. But whatever it says, ask Jesus what He wants to say to you personally.

#### Multiplication Questions

Finally, ask Multiplication questions like:

Who does Jesus want you to share this story with? (Say their names).

Where does Jesus want us to “Go” to?

Can we start a new group?

Which type of new group shall we start?

These are just suggested questions to get you started. If a question doesn’t work, think of an alternative. But try to make sure you ask Listening, Obedience and Multiplication questions.

## After Each Discussion

Agree the date and time for the next meeting and share the story you will discuss.

Can you copy the bible and D-Path training to people’s smart phones?

Or can you make copies of the D-Path training to give to group members?

Or can members photograph the story?

Or can they record it being read?

Encourage members to read and pray over the story on their own each day before the group meets to discuss it. This makes a huge difference.

Finally, take time to love each other through listening to their concerns and praying for each other.

# D1 Good News

This is the introductory training for the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

Use these stories to invite people to start a new group to learn how to listen to Jesus.

## Surah 5:46 We gave Isa the Injil containing guidance and light

>   Surah 5:46 We sent Isa, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Injil (Gospel) containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah - a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.

We have come to share the guidance and light of the Gospel with you. May we share a story from the Injil about Isa?

## Matthew 11:28-30 Come to me

>   Matthew 11:28-30 Jesus said, “Come to me, all you who are tired and heavy burdened, and I will give you rest. Walk with me and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my walk is easy and my burden is light.”

What do you like about this story?

Does Jesus say “Come to church…”?

Explain that we have not come to start a church, or ask you to come to church, or to leave your church or mosque.

Does Jesus say “Learn from the preacher…”?

Explain that we have not come to preach, or tell you what to believe.

What burdens do you have?

What sort of rest does Jesus offer you?

How can you come to Jesus with your burdens?

What do you think “walk with me and learn from me” means?  
Who will you share this story with?

Would you like me to come back another time so you can hear more Jesus stories and so learn to walk with him and learn from him?

## Acts 26:18 From Darkness to Light

>   Acts 26:18 Jesus said “I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are made righteous by faith in me.”

What good news is in this story?

Jesus has sent us to you. Who is Jesus sending you to?

Who could you invite to join this group?

# D2 Listen

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

Remind the group of the 4 group rules.

## Surah 4:171 Allah has no offspring

>   Surah 4:171 “Allah has no offspring”

The Bible confirms that God has no offspring. Jesus describes God as his father in a relational way, not a biological way.

## Matthew 11:27 No One Knows the Son...

>   Matthew 11:27 Jesus said "All things have been given to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."

What good news is in this story?

Who do we need to listen to?

## John 6:45 Everyone who has heard the Father

>   John 6:45 Jesus said "Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me."

What good news is in this story?

Who do we need to listen to?

## John 6:63 The Spirit gives life

>   John 6:63 Jesus said "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for **nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit** and life. Yet there are some of you who do not believe.”

What good news is in this story?

Who do we need to listen to?

### Conclusion

Kingdom-Apprentice DNA is **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply**. Look over the D1 to D2 stories again.

How does this group help you to listen?

Which questions do you find really help you to listen?

Will you listen attentively to each other and not just wait to have your turn to speak?

Will you ask Jesus to show you what each story means and listen for His answer?

You are unlikely to hear a voice! But if you listen you will get ideas come into your head, or someone else may say something that helps. Just trust Jesus to speak in a way that you can hear. It comes with practice.

# D3 Obey

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Surah 43:63 Isa said “Fear God, and obey me.”

>   Surah 43:63 When Isa came with the clarifications, he said, “I have come to you with wisdom, and to clarify for you some of what you disagree about. So fear God, and obey me."

## Luke 6:46-49 Wise & Foolish Builders

>   Luke 6:46-49 Jesus said “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say? Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the storm struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the sand. The moment the storm struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”

What good news is in this story?

How can you have an unshakeable life?

### Conclusion

Kingdom-Apprentice DNA is **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply**. Look over the D1 to D3 stories again.

How does this group help you to obey Jesus?

Which questions do you find really help you to obey?

# D4 Multiply

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 8:5-8,11-15 The Four Soils

>   Luke 8:5-8,11-15 Jesus said “A farmer went to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.”

>   “This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but when troubles come they fall away. The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life’s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. But the seed on good soil stands for those with a good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.

What good news is in this story?

What kind of soil do you think you are?

### Conclusion

Kingdom-Apprentice DNA is **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply**. Look over the D1 to D4 stories again.

Which stories say something about multiplying?

How does this group help you to Multiply?

Which questions do you find really help you to multiply?

The next training will help you to multiply by starting a new group.

# D5 Starting New Groups

## Matthew 18:20 Where two or three gather

>   Matthew 18:20 Jesus said "Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."

What good news is in this story?

## Surah 19:34 Isa is the Word of Truth

>   Surah 19:34 That is Isa son of Mary—the Word of truth about which they doubt.

## John 16:13 The Spirit of truth will guide you

>   John 16:13 Jesus said "The Spirit of truth will guide you into all the truth."

What good news is in this story?

## John 7:18 Whoever speaks on their own seeks personal glory

>   John 7:18 Jesus said, “Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.”

What good news is in this story?

Jesus warns us not to love the sound of our own voice and be impressed by our own preaching, but to let Jesus do the talking through the stories he has given us. If we truly seek God’s glory we will value His words high above our own.

## Mark 7:9 You Observe Your Own Traditions

>   Mark 7:9 Jesus said "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!"

We need to learn from Jesus, not from our traditions. That is why we answer only from the passage, and not from what others have told us.

## Different Types of Group

We offer a number of different types of group, but all depend upon the truth of these promises. The groups can be used in families, churches, mosques, schools and out in the community and can include children and young people.

Discovery Groups (DGs) are to help people discover Jesus. They are open to anyone who wants to come, and are often mixed groups of Christians, Muslims and people of other faiths or no faith. They end when they complete D7 - Repentance.

Missional Communities (MCs) help us be salt and light in our communities by taking action on community needs. They are also open to anyone who wants to come. We will learn about these in a later training.

Growth Groups (GGs) are for people who are serious about becoming a Kingdom-Apprentice. A Growth Group is two or three people who meet regularly (usually once or twice a week) to listen to Jesus, learn from the Holy Spirit, love each other and reach out to others.

The aim of Discovery Groups and Missional Communities is to bring people to a place where they really want to be a disciple of Jesus and start a Growth Group.

After a GG has completed the D-Path training, you can use the other story-sets (Prayer, Go to the Nations, Simple Church etc. See www.kingdom-apprentices.net) or work your way slowly through [^1]Luke's Gospel and then John, Mark and Matthew before moving on to other parts of the bible. We recommend you return to at least one of the Gospel's each year.

[^1]: Luke is the best story-teller. John provides lots of application, Mark is full of action, Matthew provides a bit of everything. This suggested order is our recommendation for all new GG's . If you are going through discipleship training you will want to take time in your GG to go through the training stories.

## Starting a new Group

>   To start a new group you must train a new leader for that group, **then leave the group** to continue without you.

>   Leaving the group is essential if we are to multiply. If we do not leave the group, all we can do is to add, not multiply, and we will get exhausted!

Whenever a new group starts, go through the “Using this Training” section at the start of this manual, and start the D-Path at D1, even if the members have already gone through some of the stories in a different group. This is to help ensure sure each member is experiencing the reality of the stories and being obedient to Jesus.

As soon as any member is able to answer the questions properly, get them to take turns to lead the meetings with you assisting them. Once they are confident, leave the group, and go and start another one.

### Don’t use a condom!

Asking people to gather to a public building like a church, mosque or palaver hut is like using a condom! It prevents reproduction. Timid people could not gather a crowd and lead them, so they will not reproduce. But they can invite a few friends and neighbours to share a Jesus story at their home.

### Watering

Paul said, “I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.” When we have “planted” a group we need to “water” it to help it to grow well. This will include faithfully praying for the group’s host and members, phoning the host to encourage them and visiting from time to time to sit in on the group to ensure it is still working well and help with any questions that arise.

### Records

Obtaining regular feedback from groups can help to ensure that they are being effective, and discover if they need extra help or training.

However, many find that writing reports is tedious and difficult. Remember that Jesus said “My burden is light” - keeping records of activity must clearly serve our goal and not become a burden.

# D6 Only Jesus

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 9:57-62 Foxes have holes

>   Luke 9:57-62 As they were walking along the road, a man said to Jesus, “I will follow you wherever you go.” Jesus replied, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” He said to another man, “Follow me.” But the man replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” Still another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-bye to my family.” Jesus replied, “No-one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.”

What good news is in this story?

## Matthew 10:37-39 Anyone who loves their father...

>   Matthew 10:37-39 Jesus said “Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Do you think Jesus was mad or evil to say these things?

Are you ready to follow Jesus like this? Or do you need more time to discover who Jesus truly is?

# D7 Repentance

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Mark 1:15 The time has come

>   Mark 1:15 Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent (turn around) and believe the good news!”

What good news is in this story?

## Luke 24:47 Repentance for the forgiveness of sins

>   Luke 24:47 Jesus said "Repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in My name to all nations."

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

What does Jesus say we must repent from?

What does Jesus say we must believe?

What are the results of believing?

By now, those who want to be disciples of Jesus should be in a Growth Group, and can continue to D8 - Baptism.

Those who are not ready to join a Growth Group could start a new Discovery Group at D1, or start a Missional Community (see D14) with the M-Path stories. See D5 “Starting New Groups”.

# D8 Baptism

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

*Explain that baptism is like having a bath in the river. The next story will explain what baptism means for a disciple of Jesus.*

## Luke 24:7 Crucified and Raised Again

>   Jesus said "The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.”

What good news is in this story?

## Matthew 28:19 Go and make disciples

>   Matthew 28:19 Jesus said "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.”

What good news is in this story?

## Romans 6:3-8 Buried with him through baptism

>   Romans 6:3-8 All of us who were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death. We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin – because anyone who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.

### Conclusion

What words are used to explain what going under the water symbolises?

What words are used to explain what coming out of the water symbolises?

What happens inside us when we going under the water in baptism?

What happens inside us when we come out of the water in baptism?

If you have been obedient to D6 "Only Jesus" and D7 "Repentance" and you understand this training on Baptism then you are ready to be baptised. But before you are baptised, we recommend you go through the next training: D9-Baptism in the Holy Spirit. These two go together.

# D9 Baptism in the Spirit

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

There are four stories in this training. You may need to take some time to go through them prayerfully and discuss them with your trainer.

## John 3:3-6 You must be Born Again

>   John 3:3-6 Jesus said, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.” “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!” Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit."

What good news is in this story?

## Luke 11:9-13 Ask until you Receive

>   Luke 11:9-13 Jesus said, “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”

What good news is in this story?

## Acts 19:5-6 Tongues and Prophecy

>   Acts 19:5-6 “When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.”

What good news is in this story?

## Romans 15:13 The Spirit gives Joy in Believing

>   Romans 15:13 “May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

What do you think Jesus meant by "you must be born again"?

What are the two-parts to being born-again?

How can you receive the Holy Spirit?

What is the evidence of having received the Holy Spirit?

Will you ask your Christian trainer to baptise you in water?

Will you ask your Christian trainer to baptise you in the Holy Spirit?

### A note for Mentors

Some people say that speaking in tongues is THE evidence of baptism in the Spirit – that if you cannot speak in tongues you have not been baptised in the Holy Spirit. This is not what the bible teaches. Paul teaches about this in 1 Corinthians 12:

>   1 Cor 12:7-11 Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. To **one** there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, **to another** a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, **to another** faith by the same Spirit, **to another** gifts of healing by that one Spirit, **to another** miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, **to another** speaking in different kinds of tongues, and **to still another** the interpretation of tongues. All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.

>   v30 Do all have gifts of healing? **Do all speak in tongues?** Do all interpret? Now eagerly desire the greater gifts.

It is true that most examples of the Holy Spirit being given as recorded in Acts include speaking in tongues, but it is clear from the above passage that this was not always the case. In fact anyone can make up gibberish and call it speaking in tongues. Jesus said a tree is known by its fruit, so we should look for the biblical evidences for baptism in the Holy Spirit in a changed life, not just in the appearance of "manifestations". The final story in this training shows us to look for abounding hope, joy and peace in believing as evidence of the Holy Spirit.

# D10 Peace with God

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

John 14 is really important and full of deep truth which we need to keep coming back to. The Holy Spirit will teach you more and more as you prayerfully meditate on this chapter. Here we are focusing on what Jesus says about our new relationship with Jesus and the Father.

Believing in Jesus means believing what He says about Himself *and* believing what he says about you.

## John 14:1-3 Do not let your hearts be troubled

>   John 14:1-3 Jesus said, “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, *there* you may be also."

What good news is in this story?

## John 14:6 The way and the truth and the life

>   John 14:6 Jesus said, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."

## John 14:19-20 You are in me, and I am in you

>   John 14:19-20 Jesus said, "Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you."

What good news is in this story?

## John 14:27 My peace I give you

>   John 14:27 Jesus said, "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid."

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Who do we need to believe in?

Where does our true life come from?

How does Jesus describe the relationship between us and Him?

How does Jesus describe the relationship between himself and God?

What does that mean our relationship with God is when we come through Jesus?

Why does that give you peace?

What things could trouble your peace with God?

What does Jesus say about that?

# D11 Prayer

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

## Matthew 6:7-8 Not Like the Pagans with Many Words

>   Matthew 6:7-8 Jesus said, "When you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him."

What good news is in this story?

## Matthew 6:31-33 Do not Worry like the Pagans

>   Matthew 6:31-33 Jesus said, "So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."

Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us. And lead us out of temptation, and deliver us from the evil one.’ For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."

>   Matthew 26:39 Jesus said, "nevertheless, not my will, but Your will be done"

What good news is in this story?

## John 15:16 Pray for Fruitfulness

## Luke 8:26-39 Tell how much God has done for you

>   Luke 8:26-39 When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!” For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.

>   Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him. And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into Hell. A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.

>   When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.

>   Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. Then all the people of the region asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, “Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.

### Conclusion

Will you make sure that when you tell people about Jesus, what you share is Good News to them?

Will you share the Good News of freedom from oppression, healing from sickness, and living in God's favour with your family, friends and community?

Will you offer to heal the sick when you share the Gospel?

*The trainer should go out with the apprentice to demonstrate healing, and the GG should go out together to practice healing.*

### Healing Guidance

-   Ask what the person wants prayer for (don't assume they want healing)
-   Listen to Jesus for how to pray
-   Speak simply and calmly, without shouting.
-   You might ask Jesus to heal, or command the sickness to go, or bless the person with healing. Whatever you do, do it in faith that Jesus hears and answers.
-   Ask the person if they feel any better or felt God touch them in any way.
-   Keep listening to Jesus, praying and asking the person about any changes. Keep going until you have complete healing, or you feel you should stop.

## Matthew 5:13-16 Salt and Light

>   Matthew 5:13-16 Jesus said, “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."

### Conclusion

How can Christians lose their saltiness?

How can Christians hide their light?

### Missional Community (MC)

Missional Communities (MC’s) help us be salt and light in our communities. They are open to anyone who wants to come.

The stories above give you the basic ingredients of a Missional Community:

-   Gathering your neighbours to a meal, celebrating Jesus' life, death and resurrection.
-   Welcoming "sinners" and children.
-   Discussing and planning ways to bless and improve your community.
-   Starting up GG's for members of the community, including the children.

Will you start a Missional Community with your neighbours?

If anyone in your Missional Community has difficulty with the idea of Breaking Bread over a meal with un-baptised people, go through the N-Path training called "Breaking Bread" (you can find this at <https://kingdom-apprentices.net/en/01_apprentice-training/09_new-wineskins/n6-breaking-bread_new-wineskins_m/> or ask your trainer for a copy).

Here are some other suggestions:

-   Before the meal, tell a bible story.
-   During the meal encourage people to discuss the story.
-   Towards the end of the meal, remind people that you are celebrating Jesus’ life, death and resurrection, and His presence with you today. Raise your cups to Jesus. Someone can pray a prayer of thanks to Jesus and blessing on the gathering.
-   After the meal start discussing community needs and plan how the group can take action to help.
-   Don't let your Missional Community look like a "church service" or a bible-study. It should look more like a family gathering and be lively and fun and engaging. Arrange chairs in circles, not rows like a church!
-   If you have unbelievers present, ask them how they think God may be working in their own lives. Ask them what they can do to cooperate with God and suggest they join a GG or a Discovery Group.
-   How can your MC multiply? Is everyone in a GG? Can your MC start a Discovery Group? Or launch another MC nearby or in another community?
-   Before you end, plan when and where you will have your next MC gathering (aim to meet every week).

# D15 Multiplying Your Life

*This story is long. Learn to retell it in your own words.*

## Matthew 25:14-30 Investing Your Life

>   Matthew 25:14-30 Jesus said, “It will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.

>   The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.

>   After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.’ His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

>   The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.’ His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

>   Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’

>   His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. ‘So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'"

What has God given you that He wants you to invest in other people's lives?

Are you regularly taking risks in sharing the Gospel, healing the sick and making disciples?

## Luke 6:39-40 Can the blind lead the blind?

>   Luke 6:39-40 Jesus said, “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.

What good news is in this story?

Gospel stories can only be effectively taught by an apprentice who has made the story their own and has come to love the good news it contains. Each apprentice must pray over the story and listen to Jesus before they can guide others in discovering the good news. Otherwise they will be the blind leading the blind!

Apprentices must understand what the training is about. They must know the training stories well and understand how each story contributes to the training message. If you are not sure why a story is relevant to the training subject, ask other apprentices what they think.

### Conclusion

By now, if you have been obedient to Jesus, you should have plenty of experience starting new Discovery Groups and new Growth Groups. If you are not already training other Kingdom-Apprentices, then now is the time to start. Ask Jesus to lead you to two or three “people of peace” whom you can invest in, to present to Jesus as the fruit of His investment in you.

Also, go through the G-Path (Go to the Nations) stories in your GG, and plan to go to new communities with the Gospel.

We also recommend the P-Path (Prayer) to deepen your prayer-life.

### Apprentice Group (AG)

An Apprentice group (AG) is to train those who want to become Kingdom-Apprentices. It is led by a more experienced Kingdom-Apprentice. The purpose is to make sure apprentices understand the stories and how they relate to the training title, to share insights with each other and to emphasise the need to pray, meditate and obey the stories. It is essential that the apprentices spend time in their GG praying over the story and listening to Jesus and learn to be obedient to it. Apprentices are expected to be starting new groups and training other apprentices.

‘Experts’ do all the training because they are the best at it. But experts only grow by addition, not multiplication. So don't give in to the temptation to do all the training yourself. Jesus did not say make experts, but make disciples! People learn best by teaching, so let new apprentices teach. You need lots of practiced apprentice trainers.

Do you have a passion to make multiplying disciples? Then don't take shortcuts! Jesus said, “Everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.” Proper training is important; “Go slow to go fast”

If apprentices are highly motivated and are also in their own GG, it is possible to train a larger group of Kingdom-Apprentices, but don’t let the group be too large for everyone to contribute fully (six plus the trainer might be a reasonable limit).

Apprentices should practice sharing the “Good News” with each other, using only the words of Jesus in the story without trying to explain it or expand upon it. They should not use any religious words or concepts, or add their own explanations. Practice just using the D1 stories and appropriate questions.
