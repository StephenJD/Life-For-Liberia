### D-Path Training

This set of Gospel stories are chosen to help a person progress from curiosity about Jesus to become a fruitful, confident and obedient disciple of Jesus.

After teaching each story ask: **What good news is in this story?**

After teaching all the stories for one section, the disciples should go through the stories in their GG, using the GG questions.

# Using this Training

## Personal Obedience

A trainer is simply an apprentice who has already learnt a training story, is living in obedience to it and now wants to pass it on.

These stories can only be effectively taught by an apprentice who has made the story their own and has come to love the good news it contains. Each story is followed by the simple question "What good news is in this story?" It is up to the trainer to have prayed over the story and listened to Jesus so they can guide their apprentices in discovering the good news.

Trainers must understand what the training is about. They must know the training stories well and understand how each story contributes to the training message. If you are not sure why a story is relevant to the training subject, ask other trainers what they think.

Do you have a passion for people to learn the training? Then don't take shortcuts!

## No Experts

Experts do all the training because they are the best at it. But experts only grow by addition, not multiplication. So don't give in to the temptation to do all the training yourself. Jesus did not say make experts, but make disciples! People learn best by teaching, so let new apprentices teach. You need lots of practiced apprentice trainers.

## Growth Groups for Discipleship

This training is a carefully selected series of Gospel stories that Growth Groups can use to help disciples (apprentices) grow in the essential landmarks of discipleship. There is much that the Holy Spirit can teach us through each of these stories, and sufficient time and attention should be given to each story, before moving on to the next.

There are two essential and separate steps. First a trainer teaches the story to the GG. This Training Step is NOT a GG and does not use the GG questions. It is normally much briefer than a GG meeting would be. Don't let it drag on or degenerate into preaching.

The second step is for the GG members to meet to discuss the story and learn to be obedient to it. They may continue discussing the story for several weeks before they are ready to move on to the next story. They should not rush.

## Do NOT train people to be disobedient!

Jesus said that the wise builder is one who hears **and obeys** his words (Luke 6:46). The aim of this training is to raise up disciples who are obedient to Jesus.

For this reason, this training should **not** be rushed through. If you progress through this training too quickly without ensuring that the hearers are being obedient to what they are learning, you will train them to be disobedient! They will think that hearing or understanding is all that matters, and obedience is optional.

## Tell me the same story

We strongly recommend that both the trainers and GG members learn the training stories by heart so the Holy Spirit can keep speaking to you through them.

Most stories can easily be learnt word-perfect, but for the longer stories, being able to retell the story in your own words is sufficient.

Whenever you teach a story, if it is something Jesus said, start it with "Jesus said: ". That way the person learning will know that these are the words of Jesus.

1.  Use actions as much as possible each time you tell the story and get the apprentices to copy your actions.
2.  Recite the story from memory twice.
3.  Get the apprentices to say every detail they noticed in the story.
4.  If they miss anything ask questions to see if they remember the detail.
5.  Recite the story from memory twice more.
6.  Say, "**Tell me the same story**" until they have got it right.

After teaching every story ask "What good news is in this story?". This reminds both the trainer and the apprentice that the Gospel is Good News.

## An Example Training session

*Example for training D3:*

Today we will go through the next training in Discipleship-Landmarks. It is called D3-Four Soils. Let's say the motto together: "Love one another – Go and make disciples".

The first story is from Luke 8:5-8,11-15.

*Follow the "Teaching the Story" instructions above.*

*If they miss out any detail in step 3, ask questions like these:*

>   Who sowed the seed? How did he sow it? Where did some wasted seed fall? What happened to it? Where did the next seed fall?

Now **tell me the same story**. Let's say it all together... Luke 8:5-8,11-15 “A farmer went to sow his seed..."

*Instead of the GG questions, ask* "What good news is in this story?" *Don't rush this. They need to see the good news so they will want to spend time in their GG discussing it.*

*At the end of the training use the Conclusion questions.*

The best way to learn the story is to teach it! So will you teach this story to someone else every day this week?

### Summary of How to Train:

1.  Training Pathway name: "Discipleship-Landmarks"
2.  Training Number and Title: "D3-Four Soils."
3.  Motto: "Love one another – Go and make disciples"
4.  Story reference and recite the story from memory twice.
5.  Ask lots of simple "What is in the story" questions.
6.  Recite the story from memory twice with them copying your actions.
7.  "Tell me the same story" until they have learnt it and can say it on their own.
8.  Ask "What good news is in this story?"
9.  Ask the conclusion questions.
10. Encourage them to teach the story to someone else every day this week. The best way to learn the story is to teach it!

## Progressing through the Training

Teach D1-Discovery and D2-Growth Groups in one session if possible.

If they agree to meet in a GG, arrange to meet with them the first time to help them use the four GG questions. Start with the first training story as the text. Let them lead the discussion, but be careful not to let it drag out into a long boring session. Encourage them to pray and listen to Jesus.

Once the disciples are regularly meeting on their own as a GG and have gone over the D1 & D2 stories, you can then teach them the next training. Progress through the training at a rate that suits their growth in obedience. If you cannot give them the next training as soon as they are ready for it, encourage them to keep meeting in their GG and to go through Luke's Gospel from the beginning.

# D1 Discovery

This is the first training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Acts 26:18 From Darkness to Light

>   Acts 26:18 Jesus said “I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are made righteous by faith in me.”

What good news is in this story?

## Matthew 11:27 No One Knows the Son...

What good news is in this story?

## John 6:45 Everyone who has heard the Father

>   John 6:63 Jesus said "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for **nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit** and life. Yet there are some of you who do not believe.”

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Who needs to come to God's light?

How are we made righteous?

Who can tell us the truth about God?

Who do we need to listen to?

Can living a good and righteous life get us into heaven?

Will you go through each of these stories in your GG?

# D2 Growth Groups

This is the second training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 18:20 Where two or three gather

>   Matthew 18:20 Jesus said "Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."

What good news is in this story?

## John 16:13 The Spirit of truth will guide you

>   John 16:13 Jesus said "The Spirit of truth will guide you into all the truth."

What good news is in this story?

## Luke 6:46-49 Wise & Foolish Builders

>   Luke 6:46-49 Jesus said “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say? Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the sand. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

How can you meet with Jesus?

How can you discover truth?

How can you have an unshakeable life?

Would you like to meet in a Growth Group (GG) of two or three people to meet regularly (usually once or twice a week) to listen to Jesus, learn from the Holy Spirit, love each other and reach out to others?

Will you go through each of these stories in your GG?

### Four GG Questions

When the Growth Group meets, you start by reading (or telling) the bible story you have chosen. Each person should then **tell the same story** from memory to make sure everyone understands what they have heard. Then each person should share in discussing these four questions:

1.  What does this tell us about people's character or nature?
2.  What does this tell us about Jesus or God?
3.  What does Jesus want to say to me personally? (How will you obey?)
4.  Who does Jesus want me to share this story with? (Say their names).

Then take turns to pray for each other, and for your outreach to others.

Agree the story for the next meeting. Between meetings pray over the next story every day and see what Jesus says to you, ready for your next meeting.

### Four GG Rules

#### No more than 4 people

Two or three is the ideal size. In larger groups some people will not contribute.

Include small children in a family group. Children who can read can be in their own group –let them ask for help if they want it.

#### No Preaching Allowed

Members should not preach or teach other members. They must help each other listen to Jesus and discover for themselves.

Children’s groups may need help and reminding not to preach or be bossy to younger children.

#### Answer only from the passage

When discussing your passage and answering the GG questions, limit your answers to what is in the chosen passage. If you start quoting other scripture, or what you have learnt from commentaries, or preachers, or bible-school then you will sound like an expert and put off those who do not have your depth of knowledge.

#### Go at your own pace

Go at the pace that suits your group. Do not wear people out with difficult passages or long meetings (1½ hours is a usual GG length). You do not need to understand everything, just leave out passages you find difficult.

GG's must be free from the control of church leaders. They can decide when, where and how often they meet and what stories they discuss. They can disband and form new GG's if they choose to.

Work your way slowly through [^1]Luke's Gospel and then John, Mark and Matthew before moving on to other parts of the bible. We recommend you return to at least one of the Gospel's each year.

[^1]: Luke is the best story-teller. John provides lots of application, Mark is full of action, Matthew provides a bit of everything. This suggested order is our recommendation for all new GG's . If you are going through discipleship training you will want to take time in your GG to go through the training stories.

### Four GG Practices

#### Read the passage each day

You will get much more out of your GG if you read and pray over the agreed passage on your own each day before your GG meets to discuss it.

#### Listen to Jesus and obey Him

When thinking about a passage, it is usually easy to think how it applies to other people. But whatever it says, ask Jesus what He wants to say to you personally. He wants to bless you and help you to become more like Him. But to hear, you must listen!

Be obedient to what Jesus says to you. Obedience is the only thing that counts in being a disciple of Jesus.

#### Pray for each other

Take time to love each other through listening to your concerns and praying for each other.

#### Start New Groups

Share your GG experience with others and help them to start a GG of their own. Pray that you can start GG’s throughout your community and also in surrounding communities.

# D3 Four Soils

This is the third training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 8:5-8,11-15 The Four Soils

>   Luke 8:5-8,11-15 Jesus said “A farmer went to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.”

>   “This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but when troubles come they fall away. The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life’s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. But the seed on good soil stands for those with a good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

What kind of soil do you think you are?

Will you go through this story in your GG?

# D4 Only Jesus

This is the fourth training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 9:57-62 Foxes have holes

>   Luke 9:57-62 As they were walking along the road, a man said to Jesus, “I will follow you wherever you go.” Jesus replied, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” He said to another man, “Follow me.” But the man replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” Still another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-bye to my family.” Jesus replied, “No-one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.”

What good news is in this story?

## Matthew 10:37-39 Anyone who loves their father...

>   Matthew 10:37-39 Jesus said “Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."

What good news is in this story?

## Luke 24:7 Crucified and Raised Again

>   Jesus said "The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.”

What good news is in this story?

What good news is in this story?

## Romans 6:3-8 Buried with him through baptism

>   Romans 6:3-8 All of us who were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death. We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin – because anyone who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.

What words are used to explain what going under the water symbolises?

What words are used to explain what coming out of the water symbolises?

What happens inside us when we going under the water in baptism?

What happens inside us when we come out of the water in baptism?

If you have been obedient to D4 "Only Jesus" and D5 "Repentance" and you understand this training on Baptism then you are ready to be baptised. But before you are baptised, we recommend you go through the next training: D7-Baptism in the Holy Spirit. These two go together.

Will you go through each of these stories in your GG?

# D7 Baptism in the Spirit

This is the seventh training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

There are four stories in this training. You may need to take some time to go through them prayerfully and discuss them with your mentor.

## John 3:3-6 You must be Born Again

>   John 3:3-6 Jesus said, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.” “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!” Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit."

What good news is in this story?

## Luke 11:9-13 Ask until you Receive

>   Luke 11:9-13 Jesus said, “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”

What good news is in this story?

## Acts 19:5-6 Tongues and Prophecy

>   Acts 19:5-6 “When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.”

What good news is in this story?

## Romans 15:13 The Spirit gives Joy in Believing

>   Romans 15:13 “May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

What do you think Jesus meant by "you must be born again"?

What are the two-parts to being born-again?

How can you receive the Holy Spirit?

What is the evidence of having received the Holy Spirit?

Will you ask your Christian mentor to baptise you in water?

Will you ask your Christian mentor to baptise you in the Holy Spirit?

Will you go through each of these stories in your GG?

### A note for Mentors

Some people say that speaking in tongues is THE evidence of baptism in the Spirit – that if you cannot speak in tongues you have not been baptised in the Holy Spirit. This is not what the bible teaches. Paul teaches about this in 1 Corinthians 12:

>   1 Cor 12:7-11 Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. To **one** there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, **to another** a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, **to another** faith by the same Spirit, **to another** gifts of healing by that one Spirit, **to another** miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, **to another** speaking in different kinds of tongues, and **to still another** the interpretation of tongues. All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.

>   v30 Do all have gifts of healing? **Do all speak in tongues?** Do all interpret? Now eagerly desire the greater gifts.

It is true that most examples of the Holy Spirit being given as recorded in Acts include speaking in tongues, but it is clear from the above passage that this was not always the case. In fact anyone can make up gibberish and call it speaking in tongues. Jesus said a tree is known by its fruit, so we should look for the biblical evidences for baptism in the Holy Spirit in a changed life, not just in the appearance of "manifestations". The final story in this training shows us to look for abounding hope, joy and peace in believing as evidence of the Holy Spirit.

# D8 Peace with God

This is the eighth training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

John 14 is really important and full of deep truth which we need to keep coming back to. The Holy Spirit will teach you more and more as you prayerfully meditate on this chapter. Here we are focusing on what Jesus says about our new relationship with Jesus and the Father.

Believing in Jesus means believing what He says about Himself *and* believing what he says about you.

## John 14:1-2 Do not let your hearts be troubled

>   John 14:1-2 Jesus said, “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?"

What good news is in this story?

## John 14:6 The way and the truth and the life

>   John 14:6 Jesus said, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."

What good news is in this story?

## John 14:19-20 You are in me, and I am in you

>   John 14:19-20 Jesus said, "Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you."

What good news is in this story?

## John 14:27 My peace I give you

>   John 14:27 Jesus said, "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid."

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Who do we need to believe in?

Where does our true life come from?

How does Jesus describe the relationship between us and Him?

How does Jesus describe the relationship between himself and God?

What does that mean our relationship with God is when we come through Jesus?

Why does that give you peace?

What things could trouble your peace with God?

What does Jesus say about that?

Will you go through each of these stories in your GG?

# D9 Prayer

This is the ninth training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 6:7-8 Not Like the Pagans with Many Words

>   Matthew 6:7-8 Jesus said, "When you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him."

What good news is in this story?

## Matthew 6:31-33 Do not Worry like the Pagans

>   Matthew 6:31-33 Jesus said, "So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."

What good news is in this story?

## John 11:41-42 I know that You always hear Me.

>   John 11:41-42 Jesus said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. And I know that You always hear Me.”

What good news is in this story?

## Matthew 6:9-10, 26:39 Pray for God's Will to be Done

>   Matthew 6:9-10 Jesus said, "This is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be honoured, and your kingdom come, and your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us. And lead us out of temptation, and deliver us from the evil one.’ For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."

>   Matthew 26:39 Jesus said, "nevertheless, not my will, but Your will be done"

What good news is in this story?

## John 15:16 Pray for Fruitfulness

>   John 15:16 Jesus said, “You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you.”

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Why do we not need to pray about our basic needs?

What does Jesus say we should pray for?

How might "seeking first His Kingdom" cause your basic needs to be met?

How do you know God hears your prayers?

What is the best prayer we can pray?

Will you learn to pray by copying other people, or will you learn from Jesus how to pray?

Will you go through each of these stories in your GG?

# D10 Sharing your story

This is the tenth training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

*This story is long. It does not need to be learned perfectly, just well enough to pass the story on, like you would re-tell any story someone told you.*

*The teacher should explore the story with the apprentice using the conclusion questions.*

## Luke 8:26-39 Tell how much God has done for you

>   Luke 8:26-39 When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!” For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.

>   Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him. And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into Hell. A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.

>   When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.

>   Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. Then all the people of the region asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, “Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.

What good news is in this story?

### Conclusion

Why was Legion afraid of Jesus when he first met Him?

Why were the demons afraid of Jesus?

The only kind of power that the people knew about was evil power.

Why do you think the town people might have been afraid of Jesus?

Who is the only one in the story who was not afraid of Jesus?

Why was he not afraid?

What did Jesus tell him to do?

What effect would this have on the people's fear of Jesus?

What difference has Jesus made to your life?

Will you tell your family, friends and community what Jesus has done for you?

Will you go through each of these stories in your GG?

# D11 Healing and the Gospel of the Kingdom

This is the eleventh training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Will you share the Good News of freedom from oppression, healing from sickness, and living in God's favour with your family, friends and community?

Will you go through each of these stories in your GG?

*The mentor should go out with the apprentice to demonstrate healing, and the GG should go out together to practice healing.*

### Healing Guidance

1.  Ask what the person wants prayer for (don't assume they want healing)
2.  Listen to Jesus for how to pray
3.  Speak simply and calmly, without shouting.
4.  You might ask Jesus to heal, or command the sickness to go, or bless the person with healing. Whatever you do, do it in faith that Jesus hears and answers.
5.  Ask the person if they feel any better or felt God touch them in any way.
6.  Keep listening to Jesus, praying and asking the person about any changes. Keep going until you have complete healing, or you feel you should stop.

## Matthew 5:13-16 Salt and Light

>   Matthew 5:13-16 Jesus said, “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."

### Conclusion

How can Christians lose their saltiness?

Will you start GG's for children?

Will you celebrate the Lord's Supper with your neighbours over a proper meal?

Will you go through each of these stories in your GG?

### Missional Community

Missional Communities are a biblical way to get involved in your community so that you can multiply obedient disciples of Jesus. Will you start a Missional Community with your neighbours?

The stories above give you the basic ingredients of a Missional Community

-   Gathering your neighbours to a meal, celebrating Jesus' life, death and resurrection.
-   Welcoming "sinners" and children.
-   Discussing and planning ways to bless and improve your community.
-   Starting up GG's for the members of the community, including the children.

If anyone in your Missional Community has difficulty with the idea of Breaking Bread over a meal with un-baptised people, go through the N-Path training called "Breaking Bread" (you can find this at <https://kingdom-apprentices.net/en/01_apprentice-training/09_new-wineskins/n6-breaking-bread_new-wineskins_m/> or ask your mentor for a copy).

Here are some other suggestions:

-   Before the meal, tell a bible story.
-   During the meal encourage people to discuss the story.
-   Towards the end of the meal, remind people that you are celebrating Jesus life, death and resurrection, and His presence with you today. Raise your cups to Jesus. Someone can pray a prayer of thanks to Jesus and blessing on the gathering.
-   After the meal start discussing community needs and plan how the group can take action to help.
-   Don't let your Missional Community look like a "church service" or a bible-study. It should look more like a family gathering and be lively and fun and engaging. Arrange chairs in circles, not rows like a church!
-   If you have unbelievers present, ask them how they think God may be working in their own lives. Ask them what they can do to cooperate with God and suggest they join a GG or a Discovery Group.
-   How can your MC multiply? Is everyone in a GG? Can your MC start a Discovery Group? Or launch another MC nearby or in another community?
-   Before you end, plan when and where you will have your next MC gathering (aim to meet every week).

## Matthew 25:14-30 Investing Your Life

>   Matthew 25:14-30 Jesus said, “It will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.

>   The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.

>   After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.’ His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

>   The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.’ His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

>   Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’

>   His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. ‘So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'"
