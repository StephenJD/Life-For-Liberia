This set of Jesus stories are chosen to help a person progress through a series of important “landmarks” from curiosity about Jesus to become a Kingdom-Apprentice.

# Using this Training

This introduction is for training leaders who want to start a new group. If you are leading a group, go straight to D1.

## Discipleship Landmarks Training

A Kingdom-Apprentice is a fruitful, confident and obedient disciple of Jesus who is committed to fulfilling Jesus’ command to make multiplying disciples. Our DNA (or values) is **Good News,** **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply**.

This training is designed to be used by any kind of group, including on-line groups. It can also be used by an individual. This training describes 4 types of group: Growth Groups (D5), Discovery Groups (D5), Mission Communities (D14) and Apprentice Training Groups (D15).

Nearly all the stories are taken from the Gospels, using Luke wherever possible, and most are short quotes from Jesus himself. The reason for this is to make the training as easy as possible for those who either cannot read, or do not have a bible. If they have just the New Testament, or just the Gospels, they have all the material they need. If they have only Luke and John, they will have most of the stories. If they have only their memory, they will still do very well.

The first few trainings include some stories from surahs in the Quran for use with Muslim groups. You can omit these for Christian groups.

## The Discovery Principle

Jesus said, “I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.” (John 8:28)

If Jesus did not add His own words of explanation and preaching, then neither should we! We call this “Discovery” – we don’t allow preaching or explanations. We let Jesus do the teaching and let the person we are sharing with “discover” for themselves what Jesus is saying to them. You can explain the meaning of words, but *not* the meaning of the story.

To help a person discover the meaning, we ask questions to help them see **Good News** then **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply** (our DNA).

If they ask a question, see if the answer is in the passage, then read that part of the passage again and help them discover the answer themselves.

If they ask you something that the passage does not explain, say “I haven't come to tell you what to believe, but to help you discover Jesus for yourself. I can come back to share more stories that will help you discover the answer to your question.”

This isn’t just a new method of teaching, it is a deep Jesus-centred principle that should affect all our spiritual teaching, no matter what the context is. The role of the teacher is to bring the bible stories that help a person to discover the truth.

### Group Questions

Whatever type of group you lead, we use the same 4 DNA questions:

#### Good News Questions

Ask a *personal* question like:

“What *good news* is in this story?” or “What do you *like* about this story?”

**Don’t** ask an *academic* question like:

“What do you *think* about this story?” or “What do you *understand* from this story?”

If they are unsure how to answer, offer to read it again.

#### Listening Questions

We want the person to think about each part of the story by asking listening questions, such as:

“Is there anything else you think is good news in this story?”

“What do you think Jesus meant by...?”

“Why do you think Jesus said this?”

“What does this tell us about people's nature (or character)?”

“What does this tell us about Jesus or God’s nature?”

Listen to the Holy Spirit for questions to ask. Try to ask a listening question about each part of the story where you think there is good news. But don't make it heavy, or like an exam. Don't worry if they don't see the same revelation that you have seen.

#### Obedience Questions

Once people have thought about the detail of the story, ask Obedience questions, like:

“What does Jesus want to say to you personally through this story?”

“How will you obey?”

If they answer in an impersonal way, saying what people ought to do, try to get them to say how they will respond personally and specifically.

#### Multiplication Questions

Finally, ask these two Multiplication questions, something like:

“Is there someone you would like to share this story with?”

“Would you like to invite them to come next time we meet to share the story together?”

## Living the Story

Jesus said to go and make disciples. To make a disciple you must be a disciple, because we reproduce what we are, not what we say. If you are training apprentices to start groups and multiply, it is essential that you are also leading your own Discovery Group with non-church members.

So for each story you teach from the D-Path, you need to be living the story yourself. In other words, you need to have prayed through the story and listened to what Jesus wants to say to you and obeyed it. We need to share the story from our heart into the heart of the person we are sharing it with. Prayerfully go through the notes and questions for the story. Understand how the questions relate to the passage and the training title. Then prepare your own *listening* questions to ask.

## Learning The Stories

We strongly recommend that both the trainer and group members learn the stories by heart so Jesus can keep speaking to you through them and you can be more confident and effective when you share the story.

Most stories can easily be learnt word-perfect, but for the longer stories, being able to retell the story in your own words is sufficient.

Use a modern easy to read bible, not the King James!

If any members do not have a bible or cannot read, you can read the passage out loud and let the members record it on their phones.

Whenever you teach a story, if it is something Jesus said, start it with **"Jesus said:"**. That way the person learning will know that these are the words of Jesus.

Use actions to help people remember the story. Get the members to copy your actions.

Recite the story from memory twice and then say to the group, **"Tell me the same story"**.

For a longer story, use this learning tool:

-   Get the members to say every detail they noticed in the story.
-   If they miss anything ask questions to see if they remember the detail.
-   Recite the story from memory twice more.
-   Say, "**Tell me the same story**" until they have got it right.

## Starting a Discovery Group

Discovery groups are for outreach. They are very easy to start if you take this approach:

-   First learn the D1 stories and practice sharing them to a friend.
-   Go into the community with an experienced Discovery Group leader (or a courageous friend).
-   Meet someone and say, “Hello. What is your name? My name is.... Do you have a few minutes for me to share a story about Jesus with you?”
-   Tell the story all through, without adding your own words, or explaining it.
-   Then go straight to the 4 DNA questions...

When training new Apprentices, first demonstrate these steps using role-play, then get them to role-play the steps. New apprentices usually add lots of their own words, and end up making it more difficult. Correct them until they do it exactly as instructed. Once they are confident, they can find their own natural style.

Jesus said, “Love each other as I have loved you” so when we share Jesus stories, we do so - in the same way that Jesus loves us - heart to heart, bringing the father to them.

When sharing Jesus with someone, we have precious seed to plant in their heart. We need to plant it like seed - with care and love, not just emptying a barrow load of teaching.

### After Each Discussion

After the discussion, turn the passage into a prayer for the group members. Then take time to love each other through listening to their concerns and praying for each other.

Agree the date and time for the next meeting and share the story you will discuss next time.

Encourage members to read and pray over the story on their own each day before the group meets to discuss it. This makes a huge difference.

Can you copy the bible and D-Path training to people’s smart phones?

Or can you make copies of the D-Path training to give to group members?

Or can members photograph or WhatsApp the story?

Or can they record it being read?

## 4 Group Rules

These Group Rules have been found to be essential for happy and fruitful groups. Whenever starting any kind of new group, share these Group Rules with the members:

### 1. No Church

We are not wanting to start a church, or get anyone to start going to church, or to leave their church or mosque.

We are just sharing Jesus stories, so people can become better Christians or Muslims.

### 2. No Preaching

Members should not preach or teach other members. If people want to hear preaching they can go to church or the mosque!

Each person can share what they think, and no-one should try to correct them or say they are wrong. We do not meet to argue with each other, but to listen to and learn from each other and from Jesus. Children’s groups may need help and reminding not to preach or be bossy to younger children.

### 3. Answer only from the passage

When discussing a passage we ask you to limit your answers to what is in the chosen passage. If people start quoting other scripture, or what they have read or heard from other places, they will sound like an expert and put off those who do not have that depth of knowledge. We need to learn from Jesus, not from our traditions.

### 4. Go at your own speed

There is much that Jesus can teach us through each of these stories, and sufficient time and attention should be given to each story, before moving on to the next. If you progress too quickly without ensuring that the hearers are being obedient to what they are learning, you will train them to be disobedient! They will think that hearing or understanding is all that matters, and that obedience is optional.

Do not wear people out with difficult passages or long meetings (1½ hours is a usual meeting length). You do not need to understand everything, just leave out passages or stories you find too difficult.

Each group must be free to decide when, where and how often they meet and what stories they discuss. They can disband and form new groups if they choose to.

# D1 Good News

This is the start of the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

(Words in brackets, like these are guidance for the leader, and not intended to read out to the group)

(Use these stories to invite people to start a new group to learn how to become a disciple of Jesus.)

(If Muslims are present, ask one to read this from the Qu’ran, and afterwards ask the four Q’s. If there are no Muslims, omit the Surah)

## Surah 5:46 We gave Isa the Injil containing guidance and light

>   Surah 5:46 We sent Isa, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Injil (Gospel) containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah - a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.

(**Good News Q**:) What do you like about this story?

(**Listen Q’s**:) Who did Allah give the Injil to?

According to this passage, what is in the Injil?

(**Obedience Q**:) How will you discover this guidance and light?

(**Multiplication Q’s**:) May we share a story from the Injil about Isa, with you and your friends?

## Matthew 11:28-30 Come to me

>   Matthew 11:28-30 Jesus said, “Come to me, all you who are tired and heavy burdened, and I will give you rest. Walk with me and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my walk is easy and my burden is light.”

(**Good News Q**:) What do you like about this story?

(**Listen Q’s**:) What burdens do you have?

What sort of rest does Jesus offer you?

How can you come to Jesus with your burdens?

(**Obedience Q**:) How do you think you could obey Jesus when He says “walk with me and learn from me”?

(Often people ask about church or listening to preachers, so you can ask:)

Does Jesus say “Come to church…”?

Does Jesus say “Learn from the preacher…”?

(Then you can explain that we have not come to start a church, or ask them to come to church, or to leave their church or mosque. We have not come to preach, or tell them what to believe. Many people will not know how to obey this, so you can offer to come back with more stories to help them discover how to walk with Jesus.)

(**Multiplication Q’s**:) Who will you share this story with?

Could we start a little group at your house with some of your friends to discuss more Jesus stories so you can discover how to walk with him and learn from him?

## Acts 26:18 From Darkness to Light

>   Acts 26:18 Jesus said “I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are made right with God by faith in me.”

(**Good News Q**:) What do you like about this story?

(**Listen Q’s**:) What darkness are you aware of in your life?

Who do you think has the right to forgive us our sins?

What do you think it means to be “made right with God”?

(**Obedience Q**:) What do you think Jesus wants to say to you today?

(**Multiplication Q’s**:) Jesus has sent me to you. Who is Jesus sending you to, to share this story with?

Who will you invite to join this group?

# D2 Listen

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

(Explain the 4 group rules from the introduction: No Church, No Preaching, Answer only from the passage, Go at your own speed.)

(If there are no Muslims, omit the Surah)

## Surah 4:171 Allah has no offspring

>   Surah 4:171 “Allah has no offspring”

The Bible confirms that God has no offspring. Jesus describes God as his father in a relational way, not a biological way.

## Matthew 11:27 No One Knows the Son...

>   Matthew 11:27 Jesus said "All things have been given to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."

(**Good News Q**:) What do you like about this story?

(**Listen Q’s**:) Who truly knows what God is like?

Who must we listen to if we are to truly discover what God is like?

(**Obedience Q**:) What do you think Jesus is saying to you about this?

(**Multiplication Q’s**:) Who will you share this story with? Will you invite them to join this group?

## John 6:45 Everyone who has heard the Father

>   John 6:45 Jesus said "Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me."

(Use the usual Good News, Obedience and Multiplication Q’s. Here is a suggested Listen Q:)

(**Listen Q’s**:) According to Jesus, what has to happen before a person comes to Jesus?

## John 6:63 The Spirit gives life

>   John 6:63 Jesus said "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life. Yet there are some of you who do not believe.”

(Use the usual Good News, Obedience and Multiplication Q’s)

(**Listen Q’s**:) Where does true life come from?

Why do you think Jesus says “the flesh counts for nothing”?

Why do you think some people don’t believe Jesus?

### Conclusion

Kingdom-Apprentice DNA is **Good News,** **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply**. Look over the D1 and D2 stories again.

The most important step in walking with Jesus is learning to listen to Him. You are unlikely to hear a voice! But if you listen you will get ideas come into your head, or someone else may say something that helps. Just trust Jesus to speak in a way that you can hear. It comes with practice.

Jesus often speaks to us through our discussion. Will you **listen** attentively to each other and not just wait to have your turn to speak?

Will you ask Jesus to show you how He wants you to **obey** each story and listen for His answer?

# D3 Obey

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

(If Muslims are present, ask one to read this from the Qu’ran, and afterwards ask the four Q’s. If there are no Muslims, omit the Surah)

## Surah 43:63 Isa said “Fear God, and obey me.”

>   Surah 43:63 When Isa came with the clarifications, he said, “I have come to you with wisdom, and to clarify for you some of what you disagree about. So fear God, and obey me."

(**Good News Q**:) What do you like about this story?

(**Listen Q’s**:) According to this passage what does Isa bring us?

Who does this passage say we should obey?

(**Obedience Q**:) How will you discover how to obey Isa?

(**Multiplication Q’s**:) May we share a story from the Injil about Isa, with you and your friends?

## Luke 6:46-49 Wise & Foolish Builders

>   Luke 6:46-49 Jesus said “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say? Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the storm struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the sand. The moment the storm struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”

(Use the usual Good News, Obedience and Multiplication Q’s)

(**Listen Q’s**:) What kind of people is Jesus complaining about? – Are they church goers?

How can you have an unshakeable life?

### Conclusion

Kingdom-Apprentice DNA is **Good News,** **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply**. Look over the D1 to D3 stories again.

Are you listening to Jesus and obeying Him?

# D4 Multiply

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 8:5-8,11-15 The Four Soils

>   Luke 8:5-8,11-15 Jesus said “A farmer went to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and produced a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.”

>   “This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but when troubles come they fall away. The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life’s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. But the seed on good soil stands for those with a good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persisting produce a crop.

(Use the usual Good News, Obedience and Multiplication Q’s)

(**Listen Q’s**:) What four things must be true if we are good soil? (Hear, Retain, Persist, Produce)

What kind of soil do you think you are? (Most of us are thorny – some growth, but not yet Persisting to Produce a crop).

(**Obedience Q’s**:) What does Jesus want you to persist in?

### Conclusion

Kingdom-Apprentice DNA is **Good News,** **Listen**, **Obey** and **Multiply**. Look over the D1 to D4 stories again.

“Persisting to produce a crop” is where many apprentices get stuck. They start with enthusiasm but get discouraged by difficulties, just as Jesus describes.

The next training will help you to “produce” by starting a new group.

# D5 Starting New Groups

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

(With each story ask the Good News, Listening, Obedience and Multiplication Q’s)

(If there are no Muslims, omit the Surah)

## Surah 19:34 Isa is the Word of Truth

>   Surah 19:34 That is Isa son of Mary—the Word of truth about which they doubt.

(**Listen Q’s**:) Who is the Word of Truth?

## Matthew 18:20 Where two or three gather

>   Matthew 18:20 Jesus said "Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."

(**Listen Q’s**:) When we gather in a small group, who is with us?

## John 16:13 The Spirit of truth will guide you

>   John 16:13 Jesus said "The Spirit of truth will guide you into all the truth."

(**Listen Q’s**:) Why don't we need a church leader to lead the group?

(This is why we have the “No Church” rule)

## John 14:10 The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority

>   John 14:10 Jesus said to Philip, “Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.”

(**Listen Q’s**:) What was Philip struggling to believe?

Did Jesus try to come up with his own words to help Philip understand?

Who does Jesus rely on to enable Philip to believe?

(This is why we have the “No preaching” rule)

## Mark 7:9 You Observe Your Own Traditions

>   Mark 7:9 Jesus said "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!"

(**Listen Q’s**:) What might happen if we just repeat what we have learnt from our church or other preachers?

How can we be sure to obey Jesus instead of traditions?

(This is why we have the “Answer only from the passage” rule.)

## John 16:12 I have much more to say to you

John 16:12 Jesus said, "I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear."

(**Listen Q’s**:) How did Jesus set the pace for teaching His disciples?

(This is why we have the “Go at your own pace” rule.)

## Different Types of Group

(If any members of the group are willing to try to start a new group, or are sure they want to become a disciple of Jesus, go through the rest of this section with them.)

We offer a number of different types of group, but all depend upon the truth of these promises and use the same four questions and the same four rules. The groups can be used in families, churches, mosques, schools and out in the community and can include children and young people.

All the groups rely on the same discovery principle (see the D-Path Introduction for more detail). So, in one sense, all the groups are discovery groups, but we use the term “Discovery Group” in a specific way:

**Discovery Groups (DGs)** are for those who need to Discover who Jesus is, so they can listen to Him and obey Him. They are open to anyone who wants to start their journey of learning about Jesus. They are often mixed groups of Christians, Muslims and people of other faiths or no faith. They end when they complete D7 - Repentance. Apprentices should continue their journey of faith in a Growth Group.

**Growth Groups (GGs**) are for people who are serious about becoming a Kingdom-Apprentice. A Growth Group is two or three people who meet regularly (usually once or twice a week) to listen to Jesus, learn from the Holy Spirit, love each other and reach out to others. Experience has shown that three is the best GG size. Anyone who knows they want to be a disciple of Jesus should now be encouraged to start a Growth Group. They can continue in the DG if they wish, but should also meet with one or two others in a GG to discuss the stories in more depth. Remember Rule 4: “Go at your own pace”; the new GG can go back to earlier stories if they wish to spend more time in them, or progress through the D-Path at a faster rate than the DG, as long as they are listening to Jesus and obeying Him.

Missional Community groups (MCs) and Apprentice Training groups (ATs) are described later in the D-Path.

After a GG has completed the D-Path training, you can use the other training paths (Prayer, Go to the Nations, Simple Church etc. See www.kingdom-apprentices.net) or work your way slowly through [^1]Luke's Gospel and then John, Mark and Matthew before moving on to other parts of the bible. We recommend you return to at least one of the Gospel's each year.

[^1]: Luke is the best story-teller. John provides lots of application, Mark is full of action, Matthew provides a bit of everything. This suggested order is our recommendation for all new GG's . If you are going through discipleship training you will want to take time in your GG to go through the training stories.

## Multiplying Groups

>   **Train:** To start a new group you must train a new leader for that group by taking them through the “Using this Training” section at the start of this manual.

**Start:** Go with your new leader to start a new group. A new group should start the D-Path at D1, even if some of the members have already gone through some of the stories in a different group. This is to help ensure sure each member is experiencing the reality of the stories and being obedient to Jesus.

>   **Observe:** Let your new leader lead the meetings with you observing but not interfering. After the meeting you can share any advice you have.

>   **Delegate:** As soon as any member is able to answer the questions properly, get them to take turns to lead the meetings with your new leader assisting them. This is the next-generation leader.

>   **Leave:** Leaving the group is essential if we are to multiply. If we do not leave the group, all we can do is to add, not multiply, and we will get exhausted!

### Don’t use a condom!

Asking people to gather to a public building like a church, mosque or palaver hut is like using a condom! It prevents reproduction. Timid people could not gather a crowd and lead them, so they will not reproduce. But they can invite a few friends and neighbours to share a Jesus story at their home.

### Watering

Paul said, “I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.” When we have “planted” a group we need to “water” it to help it to grow well. This will include faithfully praying for the group’s leader and members, phoning the leader to encourage them and visiting from time to time to sit in on the group to ensure it is still working well and help with any problems that arise.

### Records

Obtaining regular feedback from groups can help to ensure that they are being effective, and discover if they need extra help or training. However, many find that writing reports is tedious and difficult. Remember that Jesus said “My burden is light” - keeping records of activity must clearly serve our goal and not become a burden. There is a feedback form at the end of the D-Path you can use if you find it helpful.

# D6 Only Jesus

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

(Ask the Good News, Listening, Obedience and Multiplication Q’s)

## Luke 9:57-62 Foxes have holes

>   Luke 9:57-62 As they were walking along the road, a man said to Jesus, “I will follow you wherever you go.” Jesus replied, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” He said to another man, “Follow me.” But the man replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” Still another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-bye to my family.” Jesus replied, “No-one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.”

(**Listen Q’s**:) If I answered you like Jesus did, what would you think about me?

How do you think the three people that Jesus answered felt about His answer?

What difference does it make, that it was Jesus who said this?

How do you think you would feel if Jesus said these things to you right now?

## Matthew 10:37-39 Anyone who loves their father...

>   Matthew 10:37-39 Jesus said “Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."

(**Listen Q’s**:) Do you think Jesus is truly worth such a commitment?

Are you ready to follow Jesus like this? Or do you need more time to discover who Jesus truly is?

# D7 Repentance

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

(Ask the Good News, Listening, Obedience and Multiplication Q’s)

## Mark 1:15 The time has come

>   Mark 1:15 Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent (turn around) and believe the good news!”

(Explain that some translations say “repent from your sins” but the original just says “repent”. Repent means “turn around and go in the opposite direction”)

(**Listen Q’s**:) What direction do you think your life is travelling in?

Why do you think Jesus says we need to “turn around”?

What good news does Jesus want us to believe?

## Luke 24:47 Repentance for the forgiveness of sins

>   Luke 24:47 Jesus said "Repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in My name to all nations."

(**Listen Q’s**:) If we turn our lives around to obey Jesus, what does Jesus promise to do about our sin?

### Conclusion

This is the last training for Discovery Groups.

Those who want to be disciples of Jesus should be in a Growth Group by now, and can continue to D8 - Baptism.

Those who are not ready to join a Growth Group could start a new Discovery Group at D1, or start a Missional Community (see D14). See D5 “Starting New Groups”.

# D8 Baptism

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

We assume that you are now in a GG and you no longer have a group leader. Continue to use the four questions you have got used to.

Baptism is like having a bath in the river. The next story will help you discover what baptism means for a disciple of Jesus.

## Luke 24:7 Crucified and Raised Again

>   Jesus said "The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.”

## Matthew 28:19 Go and make disciples

>   Matthew 28:19 Jesus said "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.”

## Romans 6:3-8 Buried with him through baptism

>   Romans 6:3-8 All of us who were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death. We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin – because anyone who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.

(**Listen Q’s**:) What words are used to explain what going under the water symbolises?

What words are used to explain what coming out of the water symbolises?

What happens inside us when we going under the water in baptism?

What happens inside us when we come out of the water in baptism?

(**Obedience Q’s**:) Have you been obedient to D6 "Only Jesus" and D7 "Repentance"?

Do you understand this training on Baptism?

How will you obey?

Before you are baptised, we recommend you go through the next training: D9-Baptism in the Holy Spirit. These two go together.

# D9 Baptism in the Spirit

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

There are four stories in this training. You may need to take some time to go through them prayerfully and discuss them with your trainer.

## John 3:3-6 You must be Born Again

>   John 3:3-6 Jesus said, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.” “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!” Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit."

(**Listen Q’s**:) What do you think Jesus is referring to when he says that to enter the Kingdom of God we must be “born of water”? Look at D8 if you aren’t sure.

What do you think Jesus is referring to when he says that to enter the Kingdom of God we must also be “born of the Spirit”?

Is being “born again” something that you can do by being baptised and praying a prayer of commitment?

## Luke 11:9-13 Ask until you Receive

>   Luke 11:9-13 Jesus said, “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”

## Acts 19:5-6 Tongues and Prophecy

>   Acts 19:5-6 “When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.”

(**Listen Q’s**:) Do you have any idea what “they spoke with tongues and prophesied” means? If not, ask your trainer to show you in the bible.

Some people say that speaking in tongues is THE evidence of baptism in the Spirit – that if you cannot speak in tongues you have not been baptised in the Holy Spirit. This is not what the bible teaches. Paul teaches about this in 1 Corinthians 12:

>   1 Cor 12:7-11 Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. To **one** there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, **to another** a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, **to another** faith by the same Spirit, **to another** gifts of healing by that one Spirit, **to another** miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, **to another** speaking in different kinds of tongues, and **to still another** the interpretation of tongues. All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.

>   v30 Do all have gifts of healing? **Do all speak in tongues?** Do all interpret? Now eagerly desire the greater gifts.

It is true that most examples of the Holy Spirit being given as recorded in Acts include speaking in tongues, but it is clear from the above passage that this was not always the case. In fact anyone can make up gibberish and call it speaking in tongues. Jesus said a tree is known by its fruit, so we should look for the biblical evidences for baptism in the Holy Spirit in a changed life, not just in the appearance of "manifestations". The final story in this training shows us what to look for as evidence of the Holy Spirit.

## Romans 15:13 The Spirit gives Joy in Believing

>   Romans 15:13 “May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”

(**Listen Q’s**:) What does this scripture say is the evidence of having received the Holy Spirit?

(**Obedience Q’s**:)Will you ask your Christian trainer to baptise you in water?

Will you ask your Christian trainer to baptise you in the Holy Spirit?

# D10 Peace with God

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

John 14 is really important and full of deep truth which we need to keep coming back to. The Holy Spirit will teach you more and more as you prayerfully meditate on this chapter. Here we are focusing on what Jesus says about our new relationship with Jesus and the Father.

Believing in Jesus means believing what He says about Himself *and* believing what he says about you.

## John 14:1-3 Do not let your hearts be troubled

>   John 14:1-3 Jesus said, “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, *there* you may be also."

(**Listen Q’s**:) The Jews, like many people, already believed in God. What did you used to believe about God that troubled your heart? Did you fear his judgement and wrath? Did you feel ashamed and guilty? Did you feel distant from God?

What does Jesus say that “believing also in me” will change in our relationship with God?

Why did Jesus say “I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you”? What is Jesus trying to reassure us about?

How does this make you feel?

## John 14:6 The way and the truth and the life

>   John 14:6 Jesus said, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."

## John 14:19-20 You are in me, and I am in you

>   John 14:19-20 Jesus said, "Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you."

(**Listen Q’s**:) Why do you “live”? Is it because you are a very good person?

What will you, one day, realize is true?

If you could live every day knowing this, what difference would it make?

## John 14:27 My peace I give you

>   John 14:27 Jesus said, "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid."

(**Listen Q’s**:) Why do these words of Jesus give you peace?

What things could trouble your peace with God?

What does Jesus say about that?

# D11 Prayer

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 6:7-8 Not Like the Pagans with Many Words

>   Matthew 6:7-8 Jesus said, "When you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him."

(**Listen Q’s**:) What makes many people plead with God and keep asking for the same things?

(**Obedience Q’s**:) Will you learn to pray by copying other people, or will you learn from Jesus how to pray?

## Matthew 6:31-33 Do not Worry like the Pagans

>   Matthew 6:31-33 Jesus said, "So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."

(**Listen Q’s**:) What makes many people worry about their basic needs?

Many Christians also live in poverty and struggle for their basic needs. What does Jesus say they should do?

How do you think that “seeking first his kingdom and his righteousness” could result in your needs being met?

## John 11:41-42 I know that You always hear Me.

>   John 11:41-42 Jesus said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. And I know that You always hear Me.”

## Matthew 6:9-15, 26:39 Pray for God's Will to be Done

>   Matthew 6:9-15 Jesus said, "This is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be honoured, and your kingdom come, and your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us. And lead us away from temptation, and deliver us from the evil one.’ For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."

>   Matthew 26:39 Jesus said, "nevertheless, not my will, but Your will be done"

(**Listen Q’s**:) What is the best prayer we can pray?

## John 15:16 Pray for Fruitfulness

>   John 15:16 Jesus said, “You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you.”

(**Obedience Q’s**:) How will you pray in response to this promise?

If you want to grow more in prayer, go through the P-Path (Prayer).

# D12 Sharing your story

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

This story is long. It does not need to be learned perfectly, just well enough to pass the story on, like you would re-tell any story someone told you.

## Luke 8:26-39 Tell how much God has done for you

>   Luke 8:26-39 When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!” For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.

>   Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him. And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into Hell. A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.

>   When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.

>   Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. Then all the people of the region asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, “Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.

Like in many pagan communities, the only kind of power that the people knew about in this town was evil power.

(**Listen Q’s**:) Why was the possessed man afraid of Jesus when he first met Him?

Why were the demons (Legion) afraid of Jesus?

Why do you think the town people might have been afraid of Jesus?

Why was the delivered man not afraid of Jesus?

What did Jesus tell him to do?

What effect would this have on the people's fear of Jesus?

What difference has Jesus made to your life?

(**Obedience Q’s**:) Will you tell your family, friends and community what Jesus has done for you?

# D13 Healing and the Gospel of the Kingdom

This story is in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Luke 4:18-19 Good news to the poor

>   Luke 4:18-19 Jesus said, “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour.”

## Luke 9:1,6 Heal the sick

>   Luke 9:1,6 When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. … So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.

(**Obedience Q’s**:) Will you make sure that when you tell people about Jesus, what you share is Good News to them?

Will you share the Good News of freedom from oppression, healing from sickness, and living in God's favour with your family, friends and community?

Will you offer to heal the sick when you share the Gospel?

Get your trainer to go out with you to show you how to heal the sick. Then go out together as a GG to heal the sick and start new Discovery Groups.

### Healing Guidance

-   Ask what the person wants prayer for (don't assume they want healing)
-   Listen to Jesus for how to pray
-   Speak simply and calmly, without shouting.
-   You might ask Jesus to heal, or command the sickness to go, or bless the person with healing. Whatever you do, do it in faith that Jesus hears and answers.
-   Ask the person if they feel any better or felt God touch them in any way.
-   Keep listening to Jesus, praying and asking the person about any changes. Keep going until you have complete healing, or you feel you should stop.

# D14 Missional Communities

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

## Matthew 5:13-16 Salt and Light

>   Matthew 5:13-16 Jesus said, “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."

(**Listen Q’s**:) How can Christians lose their saltiness?

How can Christians hide their light?

If Christians all go to church on Sundays, is their light visible for all to see, or is it hidden behind walls?

If Christians don’t engage in their community, is their light visible for all to see?

## Luke 5:29-32 Levi's Dinner Party

>   Luke 5:29-32 Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”

(**Listen Q’s**:) Christians often avoid drunks, drug addicts, thieves, layabouts and prostitutes. What does Jesus want for them?

## Luke 18:15-17 Let the little children come

>   Luke 18:15-17 People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”

(**Listen Q’s**:) In church services children are usually kept quiet in a corner. What does Jesus want for the children?

## Luke 22:14-20 The Lord's Supper

>   Luke 22:14-20 Jesus and his disciples reclined at the table. ... And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you."

(**Listen Q’s**:) Did Jesus tell us to remember him with token pieces of bread and little sips of fruit juice?

### Missional Community (MC)

By now, you may be wondering about how “church” fits in with DG’s, GG’s and Kingdom-Apprentices. Well, here is our suggestion for “church”. Instead of copying other people’s traditions, we try to learn from Jesus and do it His way.

Missional Communities (MC’s) help us be salt and light in our communities. They are a great way for GG’s in an area to come together, and are open to anyone who wants to come.

The stories above give you the basic ingredients of a Missional Community:

-   Gathering your local GG’s and neighbours to a meal, celebrating Jesus' life, death and resurrection.
-   Welcoming "sinners" and children.
-   Discussing and planning ways to bless and improve your community.
-   Starting up new GG's for members of the community, including the children.

Will you start a Missional Community with your local GG’s and neighbours?

If anyone in your Missional Community has difficulty with the idea of Breaking Bread over a meal with un-baptised people, go through the N-Path training called "Breaking Bread" (you can find this at <https://kingdom-apprentices.net/en/01_apprentice-training/08_new-wineskins/n6-breaking-bread_new-wineskins_m/> or ask your trainer for a copy).

Here are some other suggestions:

-   Before the meal, tell a bible story.
-   During the meal encourage people to discuss the story.
-   Towards the end of the meal, remind people that you are celebrating Jesus’ life, death and resurrection, and His presence with you today. Raise your cups to Jesus. Someone can pray a prayer of thanks to Jesus and blessing on the gathering.
-   After the meal start discussing community needs and plan how the group can take action to help.
-   Don't let your Missional Community look like a "church service" or a bible-study. It should look more like a family gathering and be lively and fun and engaging. Arrange chairs in circles, not rows like a church!
-   If you have unbelievers present, ask them how they think God may be working in their own lives. Ask them what they can do to cooperate with God and suggest they join a Discovery Group.
-   How can your MC multiply? Is everyone in a GG? Can your MC start a Discovery Group? Or launch another MC nearby or in another community?
-   Before you end, plan when and where you will have your next MC gathering (weekly, or perhaps monthly?).

# D15 Multiplying Your Life

This is the final training in the D-Path: **D**iscipleship Landmarks.

Motto: Love one another – Go and make disciples

This story is long. Learn to retell it in your own words.

## Matthew 25:14-30 Investing Your Life

>   Matthew 25:14-30 Jesus said, “It will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.

>   The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.

>   After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.’ His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

>   The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.’ His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

>   Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’

>   His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. ‘So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'"

(**Listen Q’s**:) What has God given you that He wants you to invest in other people's lives?

The man with one bag of gold was afraid to take risks. Are you regularly taking risks in sharing the Gospel, healing the sick and making disciples?

## Luke 6:39-40 Can the blind lead the blind?

>   Luke 6:39-40 Jesus said, “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.

(**Obedience Q’s**:) Are you listening to Jesus and obeying the stories that you are sharing with others? Or are you the blind leading the blind?

Are you actively doing what you are trying to train others to do? Are you leading your own Discovery Group? Are you in your own Growth Group? Or are you the blind leading the blind?

Do you understand the training stories well and understand how each story contributes to the training message? If you are not sure why a story is relevant to the training subject, ask other apprentices what they think.

### Conclusion

By now, if you have been obedient to Jesus, you should have plenty of experience starting new Discovery Groups and new Growth Groups. If you are not already training other Kingdom-Apprentices, then now is the time to start. Ask Jesus to lead you to two or three “people of peace” whom you can invest in, to present to Jesus as the fruit of His investment in you.

Also, go through the G-Path (Go to the Nations) stories in your GG, and plan to go to new communities with the Gospel.

We also recommend the P-Path (Prayer) to deepen your prayer-life.

### Apprentice Training Group (AT)

An Apprentice Training group (AT) is to train those who want to become Kingdom-Apprentices. It is led by a more experienced Kingdom-Apprentice. The purpose is to make sure apprentices understand the stories and how they relate to the training title, to share insights with each other and to emphasise the need to pray, meditate and obey the stories. It is essential that the apprentices spend time in their GG praying over the story and listening to Jesus and learn to be obedient to Him. Apprentices are expected to be starting new groups and training other apprentices.

‘Experts’ do all the training because they are the best at it. But experts only grow by addition, not multiplication. So don't give in to the temptation to do all the training yourself. Jesus did not say make experts, but make disciples! People learn best by teaching, so let new apprentices teach. You need lots of practiced apprentice trainers.

Do you have a passion to make multiplying disciples? Then don't take shortcuts! Jesus said, “Everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.” Proper training is important; “Go slow to go fast”

If apprentices are highly motivated and are also in their own GG, it is possible to train a larger group of Kingdom-Apprentices, but don’t let the group be too large for everyone to contribute fully (six plus the trainer might be a reasonable limit).
