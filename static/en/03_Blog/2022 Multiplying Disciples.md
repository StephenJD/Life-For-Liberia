# 2022 Multiplying Disciples

On 27th June we launched our Multiplying Disciples Training via Zoom. We started with the first Multiplication Training Story, "Finding Apprentices". This is the story of Jesus calling Simon and Andrew to follow Him and He would make them fishers of men. Our obedience to this story involves recruiting up to 110 apprentices from our churches to follow the training to become multiplying disciples.
