# Introduction to Healing

Start service with invitation to the sick for healing.

During worship, pray for the sick. Those healed stand one side, those not healed stand with the worship band.

After worship share testimonies – both those just healed and other testimonies.

## Preach – do this at every preach!

We have x healed and y not yet healed. What is this a measure of?

Do the people on the right have more faith than the people on the left?

Are the people on the right more righteous than the people on the left?

Perhaps it is God’s fault. Does God only want 5/8 to be healed?

Does God want the people on the right to glorify Him in health and the people on the left to remain sick and glorify Him in sickness?

It is none of these things. What you are looking at is how closely I resemble Jesus. In the gospels we read that Jesus healed all who came to him. What you have seen this morning is that 5/8 who came to Stephen were healed. I have some growing to do to become like Jesus.

Now tell me what you think about these scriptures:

### Jesus healed ALL who came to him – and they came in huge numbers:

“Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.” (**Mt 9:35**)

“And wherever he went—into villages, towns or countryside— they placed the sick in the market-places. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.” (**Mk 6:56**)

“A great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon, had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by evil spirits were cured, and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.” (**Lu 6:17-20**)

Luke says, “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.” (**Ac 10:38**)

### Jesus sent out his disciples to heal the sick

Jesus did not keep healing as His own special ministry. He sent out first the 12 disciples and then 72 disciples to go throughout the land healing the sick and proclaiming the Kingdom of God. Everywhere they went they saw the sick healed.

“He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness… Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.” (**Mt 10:1,8**)

“When you enter a town and are welcomed … Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you.’” (**Lu 10:8-9**)

### The Apostles healed all the sick after the Resurrection

“Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.” (**Ac 2:43**)

“With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all.” (**Ac 4:33**)

“The apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people.” (**Ac 5:12**)

“Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by evil spirits, and **all of them were healed**.” (**Acts 5:16**)

“The chief official’s father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him. When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island of Malta came and were cured.” (**Ac 28:8-9**)

### The apostles preached the Gospel with Power

“The things that mark an apostle—signs, wonders and miracles—were done among you with great perseverance.” (**2Co 12:12**)

“My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power, so that your faith might not rest on men’s wisdom, but on God’s power.” (**1Co 2:4-5**)

“I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done— by the power of signs and miracles, through the power of the Spirit.” (**Ro 15:18-19**)

## What do we make of this?

The church grew and whole nations turned to Christ because the Gospel was preached in the power of the Holy Spirit and the sick were healed. That, my friends, is what we are called to. To present the gospel, not just with words but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power, so that faith might not rest on men’s wisdom, but on God’s power.

Last year I spoke to you about demonstrating the Good News of the gospel by caring for people in the community – doing acts of kindness, offering to pray for them, loving them in whatever practical ways we can. We must continue to do that, but it is time now to turn the tables on the enemy and demonstrate that King Jesus is on His throne and present with His people.
