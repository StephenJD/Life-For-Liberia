# Part 7 – Faith for Healing

### Confidence for healing

**Mt 8:16** He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.

**Mk 16:18** They will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.

**Lk 9:1** Then He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.

**Ac 10:38** God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.

### Firm Faith

**Mt 9:29** According to your faith let it be to you.

**Mt 17:20** For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.

**Mk 11:23-24**(RSV) Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.

**Lk 18:1,8 Then He spoke a parable that men always ought to pray and not lose heart…** I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the earth?

**Jn 11:40** Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?”

**Rom 4:19-21** He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead … No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.

**Heb 10:35-36(RSV)** Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that you may do the will of God and receive what is promised.

**  
Jas 1:6-8(RSV) B**ut let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person must not suppose that a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways, will receive anything from the lord.

### God’s pleasure

**Lk 12:32** Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

**Jn 14:12-14(RSV)** Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father. Whatever you ask in My name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; if you ask anything in My name, I will do it.

**Rom 15:13** Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

**2Cor 1:20**(RSV) For all the promises of God find their Yes in Him. That is why we utter the Amen through Him, to the glory of God.

**Heb 11:6(RSV)** And without faith it is impossible to please Him. For whoever would draw near to God must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek Him.

**1Jn 5:14(RSV)** And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him.

### Courage

**1Co 2:4-5(RSV)** And my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.

**2Cor 4:18**(RSV) Because we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.

**1Jo 3:8** For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.

**Ps 34:2(RSV)** My soul shall make its boast in the LORD; let the afflicted hear and be glad.

**Mic 7:7-8(RSV)** I will look to the LORD, I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me. Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me.
