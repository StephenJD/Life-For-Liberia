I affirm the uniqueness of the Apostles (capital A) who witnessed the risen Jesus \u0026ndash; the twelve, Paul, James, and possibly one or two others \u0026ndash; and of course affirm that nobody today can write Scripture. But I also affirm that there were apostles (lower case a) who, like Apollos and a number of others, had an apostolic gift and ministry without having seen the risen Jesus for themselves (compare 1 Cor 4:1-13 with Acts 18:24-28). Since I don\u0026rsquo;t see any exegetical reason to suppose this type of ministry ceased in the first generation, I am led to expect apostles (as opposed to Apostles) continuing today.\nThe problem is, however, that the vast majority of references to A/apostles and A/apostolic ministry involve Apostles (primarily Paul, Peter, James and John), as opposed to apostles (like Apollos, Barnabas, probably Silas, and possibly Timothy). So, if we are looking for guidance as to how apostles should function today, we face an exegetical challenge. When Paul is speaking about his own ministry, how can we tell whether he is speaking as an Apostle or an apostle? Following on from this, how can we tell whether modern day apostles can, or should, appropriate Paul\u0026rsquo;s words to refer to their own ministries? For example:\n\\\n Should we expect modern day apostles to be present in spirit when church discipline is conducted in a local church (1 Cor 5:4; cf. 1 Tim 1:20)?\\ Is it appropriate for modern day apostles to define their gospel, along the lines of Paul\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;my gospel\u0026rdquo; (Rom 2:16; 16:25; 2 Tim 2:8), and to charge those who disagree with them not to teach otherwise (1 Tim 1:3 et al)?\\ Should modern apostolic ministry involve going to unreached people groups (Rom 15:8-21)? Is it sub-apostolic if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t?\\ Ought modern apostles and prophets to see themselves as the foundation of the church (Eph 2:20; cf. Eph 3:4-5), and live and serve accordingly?\\ Are modern apostles responsible for laying foundations in churches, accountable directly to God for their labour, and authenticated in their ministry by vilification and suffering (1 Cor 3:1-4:13; 2 Cor 6:3-10)?\\ Can modern apostles command individuals to do them personal favours (Phm 8)?\\ Can a modern apostle speak directly to a local church to correct inaccurate theology, without going through the elders (Galatians, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Colossians, etc)?\nMuch of this, and certainly 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7, relates to the question of apostolic authority, which is an important issue for those of us who believe in apostles today. Paul, as an Apostle, clearly had Apostolic authority to define the gospel (#2), establish theological, ecclesiological and kerygmatic foundations (#4) and ensure they were preserved (#7), instruct individual believers (#6) and discipline the church if necessary (#1), with or without the agreement of the local church elders. But what about modern apostles? Do they have apostolic authority in the same sense? And if not, how does it work?\nThe whole topic has massive practical implications. Were someone to answer positively to all seven of these questions, they would effectively be blurring altogether the line between Apostles and apostles; even if they were to maintain that modern apostles could not write the Bible, they would nonetheless be arguing for almost unchallenged authority for modern apostles, with the apostle\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of Scripture the defining source of doctrine amongst the churches for which he was responsible. On the other hand, if someone were to answer negatively to all seven, then the case for there being such a thing as a modern apostle in the first place would practically disappear; if an apostle does not do any of the above things, then it is hard to see how they are any different from an itinerant evangelist or church planter. It\u0026rsquo;s not straightforward.\nDespite the implications, however, the issue has not always been thoroughly thought through. (Have compassion on people learning English, by the way: that\u0026rsquo;s three consecutive words with \u0026ldquo;ough\u0026rdquo; in them, pronounced differently each time.) Many books on apostles today have commandeered every reference to an apostolos in the New Testament, without making clear on what basis they believe each text should be applied to contemporary apostles. Other writers, more sceptical of apostolic ministry today, have dismissed all descriptions of New Testament apostleship as being unique to the first century. Meanwhile, many thoughtful practitioners, including Terry Virgo, David Devenish, and others in the Newfrontiers family, have lived out an exemplary middle ground between these two extremes \u0026ndash; but an exegetical and hermeneutical explanation of which texts apply directly to apostles today and which texts don\u0026rsquo;t, and of how we may establish the nature and limits of apostolic authority today, has not yet (to my knowledge) been provided. Hence this post.\nI propose the following starting point for the conversation. There are several texts in the New Testament in which it is clear that apostles are in view, and not just Apostles, because they contain references to those who did not witness the risen Christ. 1 Corinthians 3:5-4:13 is a clear example, because it uses the phrase \u0026ldquo;us apostles\u0026rdquo; (4:8) of Paul and Apollos. 1 Thessalonians 1-3 refers to Paul, Silvanus and Timothy as \u0026ldquo;apostles of Christ\u0026rdquo; (2:6), which indicates that the things Paul says about apostolic ministry in these chapters cannot be limited to eyewitnesses of the resurrection (we have no evidence that Silas/Silvanus witnessed the resurrection, and we know that Timothy was not even converted until many years later). Paul\u0026rsquo;s extended discourse on the ministry of the new covenant in 2 Corinthians 1-7 is almost entirely spoken in the first person plural, including Timothy and possibly Silvanus as well; although it does not use the word \u0026ldquo;apostles\u0026rdquo; in these chapters, 3:1-3 strongly implies that Paul is thinking that way. And although it is impossible to be certain, there are good reasons for thinking that Barnabas did not witness the resurrection \u0026ndash; his introduction in Acts 4:36 makes it very likely that he was not regarded as an Apostle at this point \u0026ndash; but emerged as an apostle after being sent out from Antioch (14:4, 14). This means that 1 Corinthians 9:4-14, as well as the narrative passages about him in Acts (13:4-14:28), can also be considered as applying to apostles, and not just Apostles. Taken together, that is a substantial group of texts (Acts 13:4-14:28; 1 Cor 3:5-4:13; 9:4-14; 2 Cor 1-7; 1 Thess 1-3) that shed massive light on what apostles who had not witnessed the resurrection did, and consequently might be expected to do today.\nNow look at it the other way round. There are other passages in which it seems clear, or at least likely, that Paul is speaking, not of apostolic ministry in general, but of his (or, occasionally, others') unique Apostolic ministry as eyewitness of the resurrected Christ, with the corresponding role of instructing the church in the very foundations of the gospel and Christian doctrine. So, in Galatians, Paul begins with an affirmation that he did not receive the gospel from man but directly from Jesus Christ (1:12), and this becomes the basis for an extended tirade against the Galatians (who are called \u0026ldquo;foolish\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;bewitched\u0026rdquo;), false teachers (who are considered accursed and encouraged to castrate themselves), and even the apostle Peter (who is spoken of more courteously, but still said to have been \u0026ldquo;clearly in the wrong\u0026rdquo;). Paul\u0026rsquo;s unique experience of receiving his gospel directly from Jesus gives him licence to correct others in ways that Apollos and Silvanus, we may assume, did not (and this surely also applies to his use of the phrase \u0026ldquo;my gospel\u0026rdquo; in Romans and 2 Timothy). Similarly, in other texts, Paul assumes that the Apostles had a unique role in salvation history: to witness to the resurrection (1 Cor 15:1-11), and, along with the prophets, to make plain the mystery of the gospel to the nations (Eph 3:1-6), which in context is probably what is meant by being the foundation of the church (Eph 2:20). It is this conviction \u0026ndash; that Paul, along with the other Apostles, has been entrusted with the gospel of God by the risen Christ, and that it is to be preached and guarded at all costs \u0026ndash; which prompts Paul to define the gospel in such detail in Romans, and to urge its preservation with such vigour in the Pastoral Epistles (1 Tim 1:11; 2:7; 6:13-16, 20-21; 2 Tim 1:8-14; 2:2, 8; Tit 1:1-3). I imagine no readers of this article will dispute that the equivalent of this, in the church today, is the preservation of the gospel and doctrines of the Apostles, in Scripture, not the gospel and doctrines of a modern apostle.\nThese two groups of texts \u0026ndash; the ones that unambiguously refer to apostles in the broader sense, and the ones that unambiguously don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ndash; actually represent a sizeable amount of the relevant New Testament material on A/apostleship. In the first group, Paul, Apollos, Barnabas, Silas and Timothy exercise authority out of their relationship in the gospel; in the second group, Paul exercises authority based on his revelation of the gospel. The difference is significant. In the former case, it grows from a church\u0026rsquo;s voluntary submission to the apostle, because the apostle has fathered the church by preaching and embodying the gospel to the people. In the latter case, the authority transcends gospel relationship: it is gospel revelation, and as such Paul\u0026rsquo;s gospel is right, and the Judaizers' gospel is wrong, whether they \u0026ldquo;receive his Apostolic input\u0026rdquo; or not.\nFrom here, I suggest, it is possible to make inferences about the handful of remaining passages in the New Testament which shape our theology of A/apostleship, but remain ambiguous with regard to whether Paul is functioning as an Apostle or an apostle (e.g. Acts 20:17-38; 1 Cor 4:15-21; Rom 15:14-25; 2 Cor 10:1-18; 12:12; Eph 4:11-16). For what it may be worth, I see Paul as speaking as an apostle in Acts 20 and 1 Corinthians 4 (because the passages are grounded in his relationship to the church through gospel ministry), as well as in 2 Corinthians 10 (because of the plural pronouns, authorship and the reference back to \u0026ldquo;letters of commendation\u0026rdquo; from chapter 3); I think Romans 15 is Paul speaking with a specific ambition and vocation, which need not be prescriptive for all A/apostles, then or now; and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure about 2 Corinthians 12:12 or Ephesians 4:11-16. The upshot of all this is that, if asked the seven questions I posed at the beginning, I would answer \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to #5 and #6, \u0026ldquo;sometimes\u0026rdquo; to #3, and \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; to #1, #2, #4 and #7. Just in case you were curious.\nSo, in a nutshell: there are apostles today; they are different from Apostles like Paul, James and Peter in a number of ways; they cannot write Scripture; they do function with apostolic authority; but it is an authority grounded in relationship through the gospel \u0026ndash; that is, seeing disciples and churches come into being through their proclamation of the gospel \u0026ndash; rather than the once-for-all revelation of the gospel which came to Paul and the eyewitnesses to the resurrection.\nAnd that means: even though we\u0026rsquo;ve got epistles, we still need apostles.  {width=\u0026ldquo;0.5215277777777778in\u0026rdquo; height=\u0026ldquo;0.48680555555555555in\u0026rdquo;}\n**Church: **King's Church Eastbourne\n**Church Website: **[http://www.kingschurch.eu]{.ul}   [Like this]{.ul}\n  [Share this]{.ul} \n  Top of Form\nUnfortunately we are temporarily unable to moderate comments, so only comments from verified users will appear.

It seems that using Gal 1:12 only proves that Paul had a special revelation of the Gospel in his Apostolic commission (this use of lower-case and upper-case is hard to make consistent :P). However, Timothy, although taking his cue from Paul, is commanded to rebuke and correct. I see no suggestion that he has to go through the elders for this. I realise we can argue that he is deriving his authority from Paul, but the fact is: Timothy is an apostle, not an Apostle and he is simply told to rebuke; not rebuke on behalf of Paul. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it a bit of an argument from silence to say apostles have no authority to directly correct doctrine in local churches, based on Gal 1:12?\n {width=\u0026ldquo;0.5388888888888889in\u0026rdquo; height=\u0026ldquo;0.5215277777777778in\u0026rdquo;}  By Andrew Wilson on 31/10/2012 at 09:26\n@Dan: Timothy was an elder, methinks (1 Tim 4:14; cf. 5:22, where the meaning of \u0026ldquo;laying on of hands\u0026rdquo; is to do with eldership), and it is certainly impossible to say he wasn\u0026rsquo;t, so I don\u0026rsquo;t think he works as an example.\n {width=\u0026ldquo;0.5215277777777778in\u0026rdquo; height=\u0026ldquo;0.5215277777777778in\u0026rdquo;}  By **[Sam Isaacson]{.ul}** on 31/10/2012 at 10:30\nHi Andrew\nThanks for posting on this - I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had any proper teaching on the apostolic, so I\u0026rsquo;m probably a bit behind the curve on this one\u0026hellip;but I\u0026rsquo;m a bit confused!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve heard others talk about the difference between Apostles and apostles, but don\u0026rsquo;t know of an argument from Scripture as to why there\u0026rsquo;s a difference\u0026hellip;is there one?

It would be very interesting to see how the role of the apostle functioned during the ante-nicene age and how the church fathers answered your seven questions.\nPersonally I find the issue rather divisive. I don\u0026rsquo;t deny that there are people with \u0026lsquo;apostolic giftings\u0026rsquo; today but you generally find they are called bishops or overseers etc. The use of the term apostle is pretty unhelpful and from my experience has led to a lot of confusion and distracting arguments that seem to do more harm than good.

I too admit to seeing no scriptural basis for the difference.\nI think many modern day apostles would say they have received a commission from Christ following a supernatural encounter rather than feeling they have a knack for it. After all Christ gave apostles, he didn\u0026rsquo;t give some people gifts, he gave some gifts (the apostles) to people (the church). Sometimes we confuse the gifts Christ gave with the gifts of the Holy Spirit which are different in nature.\nIf we follow this line of thought then we conclude there isn\u0026rsquo;t any difference between Paul and say a modern day apostle (only that Paul wrote significant chunks of the NT and modern apostles echo what Paul first wrote). We need the modern day apostles to continue to build the church up until maturity at which point Christ will stop giving us apostles (as well as the rest of the Ephesians grace gifts)\n {width=\u0026ldquo;1.2in\u0026rdquo; height=\u0026ldquo;1.0in\u0026rdquo;}  By **[Graham Clark]{.ul}** on 31/10/2012 at 16:31\nIs it possible that Timothy was not an apostle at the time when Paul was writing Colossians but was by the time of 1 Thes which starts with \u0026lsquo;Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; and then uses the plural we throughout including in 2:6 \u0026lsquo;even though as apostles of Christ\u0026rsquo;.\nIts seems to me that Paul is calling himself, Silas and Timothy all apostles.

Some of the apostles of New Testament times were forming what became recognised as the New Testament, and part of Scripture. Modern apostles, by contrast, do not propose new apostolic revelation; rather, they study, submit to and apply the apostolic revelation already given in Scripture. Nevertheless, if we believe, as we do, that apostolic ministry (in the sense lived out by Apollos, Barnabas, Silas and co) continues today, then we still have to look at the practices of New Testament apostles that we are familiar with in the New Testament, to get some idea of what apostolic ministry is. Otherwise we simply invent practices and call them apostolic. This approach inevitably leads us to concentrate on Paul, even though we recognise what was unique to his ministry and that of the twelve.\nAndrew has written a stimulating and thoughtful [article]{.ul} on how, biblically and practically, we work this all out. Despite agreeing with large sections of it, however, there are a few points where I think his view needs adjusting, and he has asked me to write and explain what these are, and why I believe a better approach is possible, and in fact necessary.\nIn the first place, I am not sure that it is helpful to distinguish between \u0026ldquo;Capital A\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;small a\u0026rdquo; apostles. This has become a practice within certain evangelical circles recently. I find it particularly in the \u0026ldquo;missions world\u0026rdquo; with which I interact a lot, where apostolic ministry is now fairly broadly accepted but is seen as pioneer church planting into unreached people groups. The distinction is therefore made between \u0026ldquo;Capital A\u0026rdquo; apostles who defined Scripture and \u0026ldquo;small a\u0026rdquo; apostles who plant churches in the unreached parts of the world. The problem this leads to is that, whilst there is pioneer evangelism and a grappling with contextualisation issues which I applaud, there is in the end very little authority at all. Indeed, it has become a philosophy of ministry for many that the function of the \u0026ldquo;small a\u0026rdquo; apostle, from another cultural context, is merely to teach the Bible and then allow the local believers to work out contextualisation because only they understand their own context. In what we have been doing in the largely unreached parts of the world, I have resisted some of this approach (whilst being passionate about the importance of contextualisation) because it is hardly what the apostle Paul did in Corinth (even if he was a \u0026ldquo;Capital A\u0026rdquo; apostle!) Paul did not simply state a few principles and then let the Corinthians work out how it applied to them; he was very specific in some of his instructions. I know we should not develop our doctrine on apostolic authority in reaction to what others teach, but it does provide a warning to us.\nI am not even sure that we can make the distinction between \u0026ldquo;Capital A\u0026rdquo; apostles and \u0026ldquo;small a\u0026rdquo; apostles in New Testament times, with the Twelve, Paul and James the brother of Jesus in the former category, and presumably Apollos, Barnabas, Silas and so on in the latter. The problem with this is that not all the \u0026ldquo;Capital A\u0026rdquo; apostles were involved in writing what became recognised as the Canon of Scripture, and some scholars think that some of the \u0026ldquo;small a\u0026rdquo; apostles were (such as theories that either Barnabas or Apollos wrote Hebrews). Luke and Mark, of course, were not apostles, and wrote the Bible anyway. So the \u0026ldquo;Capital A\u0026rdquo; versus \u0026ldquo;small a\u0026rdquo; distinction is not as clear as it might seem. Consequently, I think it is better simply to be clear on what modern day apostles do, and do not, have the authority to do. They cannot add to Scripture; they can only apply Scripture as best they understand it, and respect the judgment of others on Scripture even if they don\u0026rsquo;t agree with it, within the confines of agreed evangelical doctrine. Apostles today function in a particular way, and exercise a certain amount of authority, but they submit that authority to the revelation of Scripture, and expect those receiving the ministry of the apostle to similarly submit to Scripture, including testing what the apostle is saying.\nMy answers to Andrew\u0026rsquo;s seven questions are also somewhat different in places. In respect of #1, \u0026ldquo;Should we expect modern day apostles to be present in spirit when church discipline is conducted in a local church?\u0026rdquo;, the first point to make is that is not easy to understand what Paul means by this expression. However, I would say it depends on the circumstances and the degree of relationship between the apostle and the church. I do not think it is a mystical concept, but that they should act as though Paul were there, and that because he has the Spirit, and the Spirit of God is present with them, then through their relationship Paul is with them with spiritual authority. Many of the churches that I serve I would not say that, because my relationship is not as strong as it is with some others. I could imagine a few churches, where Scilla and I have lived for extended times, for them to be able to say not only that David Devenish has instructed then to take certain action, but that he is spiritually involved in the decision. However I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I could say that for many other situations. I agree with Andrew on #2, that it is not appropriate for modern day apostles to define their gospel, along the lines of Paul\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;my gospel\u0026rdquo;. We are entrusted with the gospel, but we have no right to define it for others (a point at which we are clearly distinct from Paul himself). With #3, \u0026ldquo;Should modern apostolic ministry involve going to unreached people groups?\u0026rdquo;, I find it difficult to prove from Scripture that all apostles went to unreached people groups, though church tradition seems to suggest that most of them did. However, even if some apostles do not feel called to do that themselves, I believe there needs to be an encouragement and motivation from apostles with reference to Romans 1:5: receiving grace and apostleship to bring all nations to the obedience of faith. This is part of the declaration of the whole counsel of God, which is an apostolic responsibility.\n#4 is more challenging: \u0026ldquo;Ought modern apostles and prophets to see themselves as the foundation of a church and live and serve accordingly?\u0026rdquo; I think there is a sense in which present day apostles and prophets are personally foundations to the churches in many instances, even though what they teach must be in accordance with the original foundation as set out in the New Testament. If not, then we simply join up with many evangelical commentators who say that the foundation is now the doctrine of the apostles and prophets, and therefore that if apostles do still exist, they are just church planting missionaries and overseers of churches. I would say that in the founding of churches there is a personalised element as well, in the New Testament and today. So for example in Acts 2, where they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, it was not just to teaching but to the teaching of people they knew and trusted who were apostles. I think this still applies today. It does not mean that the teaching of those apostles must not be tested by Scripture \u0026ndash; of course it must. Nevertheless the family feel of the New Testament church needs to be reproduced in our day, and therefore there are actual people who are foundational to the life of the church. The foundation is the same as that which was originally laid, but it needs laying dynamically in each church in each generation by those with the gifting, calling and relationship to do so. I agree that in many cases today, particularly with church adoptions, it is a question of testing the foundation rather than personally laying it completely \u0026ndash; but if we deny the personal involvement of the apostles relationally as part of the foundation, I think we are going too far away from the dynamic intent of the New Testament. The foundation is laid personally, not merely by reading Berkhof or Grudem\u0026rsquo;sSystematic Theology. On #5 and #6, I agree with Andrew\u0026rsquo;s article: yes, modern apostles are accountable directly to God for their work in the gospel and authenticated by suffering (#5); and whether they can command personal favours or not depends on the relationship involved (#6). With #7, though, I find myself disagreeing slightly: \u0026ldquo;Can a modern apostle speak directly to a local church to correct inaccurate theology, without going through the elders?\u0026rdquo; Andrew believes that the answer is no, but I am not so sure. One of the possible mistakes of emphasis that we have made in Newfrontiers over the last 30 years has been to have a relationship between apostle (or delegate) and the elders, or sometimes even just between the apostle and the lead elder, rather than between the apostle and the church. Sometimes, I\u0026rsquo;m sure, that has been because of a correct reaction to the approach of apostles who did not believe in the autonomy of the local church. But I think it is possible \u0026ndash; hard to define, but easier to discern \u0026ndash; for apostles to have a recognition of the authority of local elders, whilst still being able, out of their relationship, to speak to the church as a whole about doctrinal issues (or anything else) if they think the elders are getting it wrong.\nIt is extremely helpful to talk these ideas out in public, and because of our commitment to apostolic ministry today, it is also very important for the health of the churches we serve. Working out what it means, in practice, for apostles to serve churches \u0026ndash; and what apostolic authority actually looks like \u0026ndash; is an important challenge, and one that benefits from theological discussions like these. Hopefully these reflections will prove helpful, as we seek to bring about the obedience of faith among all nations!\n{width=\u0026ldquo;0.5215277777777778in\u0026rdquo; height=\u0026ldquo;0.5736111111111111in\u0026rdquo;}\n**Church: **Woodside Church, Bedford\n**Church Website: **woodsidechurch.com   [Like this]{.ul}\n  [Share this]{.ul} \n  Top of Form\nUnfortunately we are temporarily unable to moderate comments, so only comments from verified users will appear.

These disagreements mostly arise from differing traditions of how baptism is practiced. It is important, therefore, that we examine scripture carefully and try to let it instruct us, rather than simply try to justify our tradition.\nOur Traditions Many of us have been taught something along these lines: Salvation is by faith alone, and not by any act or merit on our part. Baptism is a public declaration of our commitment to follow Jesus. It is a symbol of sharing in Jesus' death on the cross and rising again with Him in His resurrection. Baptism must be undertaken seriously and after proper instruction, so that a person properly understands what they are doing. Some people teach that baptism counts even if it took place before the person was a believer.\nIt is helpful to start by listing the various aspects of baptism that we need to examine:\n  What does baptism actually do?\n  Is baptism required for salvation?\n  Must baptism be by full immersion?\n  Must baptism follow a conscious desire to be a disciple of Christ?\n  When should baptism take place?\n  Are baptism classes required first?\n  Who should do the baptising?\n  Must baptism be done in a public church setting?\n  At the end of this study is a list of all the New Testament scriptures that shed any light on baptism in Jesus name.\nA review of these scriptures leads to the following:\nJesus Practiced and Commands Baptism Baptism \u0026ldquo;fulfils righteousness\u0026rdquo; (Matt 3:13-15). Even Jesus needed to be baptised. He is the \u0026ldquo;pioneer of our faith\u0026rdquo;, whom we are called to follow.\n Jesus \u0026hellip; was gaining and baptising more disciples than John. (John 4:1)\n Jesus commands His followers to be baptised and obey all His commands. (Matt 28:19-20).\nBaptism is associated with Salvation  Whoever believes and is baptised will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. (Mark 16:15-16)\nJesus answered, \u0026ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy Spirit), he cannot enter the kingdom of God. (John 3:5)\n\u0026lsquo;Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. (Acts 2:38-41)\nWhen they believed ... they were baptised. Acts 8:12\nCrispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptised. (Acts 18:8)\nGod waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, and this water symbolises baptism that now saves you also \u0026ndash; not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience towards God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God\u0026rsquo;s right hand \u0026ndash; with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him. (1 Peter 3:20-22)\n Peter doesn\u0026rsquo;t say that baptism symbolises our death and resurrection with Jesus, but that the flood symbolises baptism. Baptism is the real thing, and Peter twice says that \u0026ldquo;baptism saves you\u0026rdquo;.\nBaptism was immediate and often private  The eunuch said, \u0026lsquo;Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptised?\u0026rsquo; Philip said, \u0026lsquo;If you believe with all your heart, you may.\u0026rsquo; The eunuch answered, \u0026lsquo;I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\u0026rsquo; (Acts 8:36-38)\nThen Peter said, \u0026lsquo;Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptised with water \u0026hellip; So he ordered that they be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ. (Acts 10:47-48)\nLydia \u0026hellip; was a worshipper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul\u0026rsquo;s message. When she and the members of her household were baptised, she invited us to her home. (Act 16:14-15)\n Baptism is Serious  \u0026ldquo;Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.\u0026quot; (Matthew 10:37-39)\n Before a person is baptized they should be asked to think seriously about this scripture. If they cannot enthusiastically say \u0026quot;Yes\u0026quot; to Jesus' demand here, they have not understood who Jesus is.\nBaptism joins us to the Body of Christ  We were all baptised by one Spirit so as to form one body. (1 Cor 12:13)\nAll of you who were baptised into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. (Gal 3:27)\nThere is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. (Eph 4:4-6)\n Baptism is for the forgiveness of sins  \u0026lsquo;Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. (Acts 2:38-41)\n\u0026ldquo;And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptised and wash your sins away, calling on his name.\u0026rdquo; (Acts 22:16) (Paul\u0026rsquo;s testimony)\n Baptism is for cutting us off from our sinful past to live a new life  We were baptised into Christ Jesus\u0026rsquo; death. We were buried with him \u0026hellip; in order that we may live a new life \u0026hellip; united with him in resurrection. For our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin. If we died with Christ, we will also live with him. (Rom 6:3-8)\nYour whole self, ruled by the flesh, was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. (Col 2:11-15)\n Baptism into Jesus must follow faith in Jesus Two incidents recorded in Acts are very instructive about baptism in more complex cases. These people had been baptised, but needed to be re-baptised:\n Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervour and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately. (Acts 18:24-26)\n Here we read of Apollos who was a leading disciple of Jesus. He had been baptised as a believer and was accurately teaching about Jesus. There was no doubt about the authenticity of his faith or discipleship. Nevertheless Priscilla and Aquila explained the faith more adequately. In the passage that immediately follows, Paul similarly encountered some disciples of Jesus who had been baptised as believers, but whose baptism had been for repentance, rather than into Jesus for the receiving of the Holy Spirit. Paul instructed them to be re-baptised into Jesus and we can be confident that this is what is meant by Priscilla and Aquila explaining the way of God more adequately. In the light of Paul\u0026rsquo;s instruction, it is inconceivable that Apollos did not respond to this enlightenment by being re-baptised.\nApollos\u0026rsquo; faith was accurate \u0026ndash; in so far as it went, but it was inadequate in that his believer\u0026rsquo;s baptism had been for repentance, and not into Jesus for the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The inadequacy of his baptism, even though it was by full immersion as an adult believer in Jesus as the Messiah, is surely important. He and the other believers at Ephesus did not simply need hands laid on to receive the Holy Spirit; they had first to be re-baptised.\nBaptism into Jesus must be followed by Baptism in the Holy Spirit  Paul found some disciples at Ephesus and asked them, \u0026lsquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\u0026rsquo; They answered, \u0026lsquo;No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\u0026rsquo; So Paul asked, \u0026lsquo;Then what baptism did you receive?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;John\u0026rsquo;s baptism,\u0026rsquo; they replied. Paul said, \u0026lsquo;John\u0026rsquo;s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\u0026rsquo; On hearing this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied. (Acts 19:1-19:6)\n These two passages surely present a clear biblical example for us, that where baptism has not been performed into Jesus for the baptism in the Holy Spirit, then the appropriate act of obedience and faith is to be re-baptised.\nPaul was surprised to discover these believers were not giving evidence of having been baptised in the Holy Spirit, so asks them \u0026ldquo;Then what baptism did you receive?\u0026rdquo; If they had replied \u0026ldquo;Baptism into Jesus\u0026rdquo; we may assume Paul would simply have laid hands on them to be baptised in the Holy Spirit \u0026ndash; as Peter did at Antioch. This begs the question: under what circumstances should we re-baptise people? What constitutes an inadequate baptism?\nThe problem does not seem to lie with the one performing the baptism. John the Baptist told people to repent and follow Jesus who would take away their sins. He told them to believe in Jesus as God\u0026rsquo;s Messiah. He also told them that Jesus would baptise them in the Holy Spirit. John\u0026rsquo;s baptism was not deficient in instruction or expectation. But for some reason these disciples had not been instructed about the Holy Spirit when they were baptised (\u0026ldquo;we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit\u0026rdquo;). It seems that this omission rendered their baptism deficient in its effect. The defect could not be corrected by teaching and prayer alone. They had first to be re-baptised.\nThis establishes two important principals:\n  The act of baptism may be defective due to the recipient being ignorant about the Holy Spirit.\n  Instruction followed by re-baptism is the appropriate response.\n  This passage, along with others, also shows two important truths about receiving the Holy Spirit:\n  It should be evident, both to an individual and to others, if a person has received the Holy Spirit.\n  Receiving the Holy Spirit following baptism is not automatic; it requires prayer.\n  We will look more at what the scriptures teach about receiving the Holy Spirit in a separate study.\nConclusion Neither Jesus nor any New Testament writer ever says that baptism is a symbol. It is always presented as the means by which a person enters the Kingdom of God. The death of Jesus on the cross and His resurrection from the dead is what Jesus did so that we could be saved, but what we must do is be baptised in water and the Holy Spirit. We can agree that salvation is by faith alone, but saving faith is expressed by obedience, and Jesus commanded baptism in water and the Holy Spirit.\nSince the NT presents baptism as the means of entering the Kingdom of God, it is never separated from conversion, as a separate event. The notion that someone can be saved, and then instructed in preparation for baptism, is totally absent. If preparation classes are deemed necessary, they should be re-classified as salvation classes, not baptism classes.\nSo, although salvation is occasionally described without mention of baptism, the overwhelming evidence of the NT is that baptism was considered to be an integral and necessary act in a person\u0026rsquo;s salvation. To separate baptism from salvation is something that the Bible does not permit us to do. No one who wishes to be obedient to Jesus can excuse themselves from baptism.\nIf a person is baptised in ignorance of its meaning, they should be re-baptised and then have hands laid on to be baptised in the Holy Spirit.\nThrough baptism our sins are washed away and forgiven by the death and resurrection of Jesus. Through baptism we become part of Jesus\u0026rsquo; body. Through baptism we are cut off from our past slavery to sin and given a new life in Christ. Baptism is generally a pre-requisite to baptism in the Holy Spirit.\nSo what are the simple biblical answers to our opening questions?\n  What does baptism actually do? \u0026ndash; It saves us \u0026hellip; (see previous paragraph)\n  Is baptism required for salvation? \u0026ndash; Yes!\n  Must baptism be by full immersion? \u0026ndash; If possible, otherwise, as close to immersion as is possible (this was early church practice)\n  Must baptism follow a conscious desire to be a disciple of Christ? \u0026ndash; Yes!\n  When should baptism take place? \u0026ndash; Immediately following the confession of faith.\n  Are baptism classes required first? \u0026ndash; No! Only the Gospel must be understood. BUT: it is serious. It is committing to following Jesus in priority over all else (dying to self).\n  Who should do the baptising? \u0026ndash; Usually the one who led the person to faith.\n  Must baptism be done in a public church setting? \u0026ndash; No. It should be done at any place convenient.\n  How does our teaching and practice need to be changed in order to obey the scriptures regarding baptism?\nScriptures: Matt 3:13-15 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptised by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, \u0026lsquo;I need to be baptised by you, and do you come to me?\u0026rsquo; Jesus replied, \u0026lsquo;Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfil all righteousness.\u0026rsquo; Then John consented.\nMatt 28:19-20 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.\nMark 16:15-16 He said to them, \u0026lsquo;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptised will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.\nJohn 3:5 Jesus answered, \u0026ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy Spirit), he cannot enter the kingdom of God. John 4:1 Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptising more disciples than John (Jesus - actually the disciples - baptised those who wanted to follow Him).\nActs 2:38-41 Peter replied, \u0026lsquo;Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. \u0026hellip; Those who accepted his message were baptised.\nActs 8:12 But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women. Acts 8:36-38 As they travelled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, \u0026lsquo;Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptised?\u0026rsquo; Philip said, \u0026lsquo;If you believe with all your heart, you may.\u0026rsquo; The eunuch answered, \u0026lsquo;I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\u0026rsquo; And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptised him. Acts 9:18 Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul\u0026rsquo;s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptised,\nActs 10:47-48 Then Peter said, \u0026lsquo;Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptised with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.\u0026rsquo; So he ordered that they be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAct 16:14-15 One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshipper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul\u0026rsquo;s message. When she and the members of her household were baptised, she invited us to her home.\nActs 18:8 Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptised.\nActs 18:24-19:6 Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervour and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately. While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples and asked them, \u0026lsquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\u0026rsquo; They answered, \u0026lsquo;No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\u0026rsquo; So Paul asked, \u0026lsquo;Then what baptism did you receive?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;John\u0026rsquo;s baptism,\u0026rsquo; they replied. Paul said, \u0026lsquo;John\u0026rsquo;s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\u0026rsquo; On hearing this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.\nActs 22:16 And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptised and wash your sins away, calling on his name.\u0026rdquo; (Paul\u0026rsquo;s testimony)\nRom 6:3-8 Or don\u0026rsquo;t you know that all of us who were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin \u0026ndash; because anyone who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 1 Cor 12:13 For we were all baptised by one Spirit so as to form one body\nGal 3:27 for all of you who were baptised into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. Eph 4:4-6 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.\nCol 2:11-15 In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self, ruled by the flesh, was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having cancelled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.\n1 Peter 3:20-22 God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, and this water symbolises baptism that now saves you also \u0026ndash; not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience towards God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God\u0026rsquo;s right hand \u0026ndash; with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4faf0ef09935b0ceef3296c7b79d496d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/baptism/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/baptism/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Baptism Stephen Dolley, Dec 2018 Introduction Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!\u0026rdquo; Mark 7:9.\nThis series of studies aims to help us examine various crucial aspects of our faith and practice to see if our traditions have led us to setting aside the commands of God.","tags":null,"title":"Baptism","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Be Joyful! 2Sa 6:14 \u0026ldquo;David danced before the LORD with all his might,\u0026rdquo;\nPsalm 5:11 But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy, and spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may exult in you\nPsalm 9:2 I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.\nPs 16:11 \u0026ldquo;You have made known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.\u0026rdquo;\nPsalm 21:6 For you make him most blessed forever; you make him glad with the joy of your presence.\nPs 47:1 \u0026ldquo;Clap your hands, all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy.\u0026rdquo;\nPsalm 64:10 Let the righteous one rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him!

This meal had a special quality that sets it apart from nearly all other celebrations. Birthday parties, anniversary meals and reunions all look back to some past event. Graduation parties, retirement parties, election parties, last-night parties and so on all celebrate a recent event. A barbeque might simply be celebrating family and friendship and perhaps a rare but glorious summer evening.\nAll of these elements are in the Passover Supper, but there is another element which makes the Passover unique; it also celebrates a future event. It looks forward to the coming Kingdom of God. The Israelites were delivered in the original Passover from the judgement meted out on their Egyptian \u0026ldquo;hosts\u0026rdquo; so that they could embark on a journey towards a liberated and blessed future in the Promised Land. Each year as they journeyed they celebrated the Passover meal looking back to its beginning and forward to its completion. Then, when later generations settled in that land, they continued to celebrate the Passover, yet still looking both backwards and forwards. They enjoyed and celebrated what they now possessed \u0026ndash; which their forbears could only dream about - but they also looked forward to a more complete experience of God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom when the earth would be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea (Hab 2:14).\nThe Passover meal was a joining together of past and future events that gave meaning to the present. It celebrated an identity as God\u0026rsquo;s people, a calling to bring Light to the world , a deliverance from slavery to darkness, a journey to inherit God\u0026rsquo;s promises, the present blessing of God\u0026rsquo;s presence and the assurance of a place in God\u0026rsquo;s glorious eternal fully expressed Kingdom. All of this was encompassed in the Passover.\nAlthough originally this was celebrated just once a year, by Jesus' day it was common practice to celebrate this in the home at least once a week, if not at every main meal.\nTo the Jew every meal was a sacred participation in the gifts of God\u0026rsquo;s bountiful creation. Thanksgivings were offered before and after each meal, understanding the food and drink as being a means of communion with God and with one another. The blessing and breaking of the common loaf formally opened the act of fellowship. On special occasions the meal was concluded with a cup of mingled wine and water which was blessed and passed round. The thanksgiving over the cup brought together the past, the present and the future, by praising God for His provision, remembering His redemptive action in history and praying for the coming of His kingdom.\nJesus' redefinition of the Passover Meal Jesus redefined the Passover meal, giving it a new beginning, a new middle and a new end. It is still a meal celebrating the journey of God\u0026rsquo;s people; it is still about our identity, our calling, our deliverance our journey and our inheritance. But now Jesus Himself is all of those things. He is the beginning, the journey and the end.\nHe Himself is our identity (\u0026ldquo;the church is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.\u0026rdquo; Eph 1:23), He is the Light we are called to bring to the world, He is our deliverer, He is our sustenance and our inheritance, He is eternally present with us, He is our hope. And all of this, not as a memory of the past or as a dream for the future but present in reality with us now. The architect of the Journey has come to accompany us and to start sharing out the rewards of its completion.\nJesus gave the Passover meal a new beginning \u0026ndash; the Cross. Jesus came announcing the arrival of the long-awaited Kingdom of God:\n \u0026ldquo;The time has come,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!\u0026rdquo; (Mark 1:15).\n Although Jesus both announced and demonstrated the presence of the Kingdom and claimed to have bound the strong man and was now plundering his goods, it seems that all of that was a kind of pre-view to the event by which He became King and bound the strong man. The Cross was Jesus' glorification and the moment of Satan\u0026rsquo;s defeat. As He approached Jerusalem at the beginning of His final week Jesus said,\n \u0026ldquo;The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified. Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain\u0026rdquo; ... \u0026quot; Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to Myself.\u0026quot; (John 12:23-24, 31-32)\n And so, when the time came for Him to become the King of God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom, the time of His glorification, when He would be \u0026ldquo;lifted up\u0026rdquo; on the cross, Jesus celebrated the Passover meal:\n And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u0026ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.\u0026rdquo; In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \u0026ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you\u0026rdquo; (Luke 22:19-20).\n It is notable that the Gospel writers make very little attempt to explain the logic of the Cross. Why Jesus had to die, how His death established the New Covenant, how His death obtained forgiveness of sins and so on \u0026ndash; such questions that seem to occupy so much teaching and preaching and scholarly writing and debate and disagreement \u0026ndash; get scant attention in the Gospels. The mechanism of the new beginning is not part of the Supper, only its celebration.\nJesus gives the Passover meal a new beginning \u0026ndash; the Cross. The remembrance part of the meal is focused on the self-giving of Jesus as the inauguration of a new covenant. It is not a remembrance of cruel injustice, nor of the cost of our sin and rebellion; it is not a remembrance of the example of Love Jesus gave us. Of course we cannot forget any of those things, but they are not what Jesus said to remember. Jesus commands us to remember the start of our new covenant relationship with God our Father. He gave the supper a new beginning.\nJesus gave the Passover meal a new middle \u0026ndash; feasting on Him. The supper is a celebration of a new start, but is also more than that. We don't just break the bread, we eat it. We pour out the wine and then we drink it. As well as a remembrance of the start it is also nourishment for the journey. And the journey itself is new.\nThe presence of God with us on the journey has a new depth and reality. Jesus promised he would not leave us orphaned when He was glorified on the cross. He promised to be with us always, and that the eternal Godhead would make their home in us. We do not feast alone, merely looking forward to a future real presence. Rather, just like with the disciples on the road to Emmaus, Jesus accompanies us on the journey and celebrates the Supper with us. But even more than that, He Himself is the supper!\n \u0026quot;For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them\u0026quot; (John 6:55-56)\n Jesus is the real food that God gives us to sustain us on our journey towards our inheritance. This is in contrast to the symbolic foods of Manna, the Passover lamb and the offerings in the Law which were also eaten. Jesus is the reality to which these things pointed. But Jesus is also real food in contrast to the many things people crave to feed their impoverished souls \u0026ndash; wealth, power, popularity, sex. And even, we might say, Jesus is the real food in contrast to the bread and wine of the Supper, which of themselves are only symbols of Him. Notice how Jesus stresses real union with Him: \u0026quot;they in Me, and I in them\u0026quot; - words He repeats after the Supper and again in His prayer before the cross:\n \u0026quot;I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.\u0026quot; (John 14:20)\n\u0026quot;that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us ... that they may be one as we are one\u0026mdash; I in them and you in me (John 17:21-23)\n When Jesus told the people that they must eat His flesh and drink His blood, He was not telling them to share the broken bread and poured out wine of the Lord's supper; He was talking about being one with Him; sharing His life and identity:\n \u0026quot;If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.\u0026quot; (John 15:5)\n So Jesus gave Himself as the New Covenant which we remember as the start of our journey, and He also gives Himself to us as our daily bread for the journey, sustaining our soul and spirit. We feast on Him.\nBut we need more than sustenance along the journey. We also need guidance and companionship and comfort and motivation. Jesus is all of these as well (Jn 14:16,23,26, 16:13, Matt 28:20). Jesus gave the Supper a new middle.\nJesus gave the Passover meal a new end \u0026ndash; His Kingdom on earth. Jesus gave the Supper a new beginning and a new middle. But as we have seen, the uniqueness of the Passover meal was in that it also looked forward to an assured future; and Jesus gave the supper a new end. He said:\n \u0026ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.\u0026rdquo; After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, \u0026ldquo;Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u0026rdquo; (Luke 22:15-18. See also Matt 26:29 and Mark 14:25)\n We do not have to wait for long! On the day of the resurrection Jesus ate fish with the disciples, then broke bread on the road to Emmaus, and shared breakfast with the disciples on the shores of Galilee, and according to Peter, Jesus ate and drank with many other witnesses of the resurrection (Acts 10:41). The fact that Jesus ate and drank with so many after the resurrection shows us that the Kingdom of God has indeed come.\nAnd the fifth gospel, Acts, bears powerful testimony that the Kingdom has indeed come. All the leaders in Jerusalem that had conspired together to kill Jesus were confronted with the irrefutable evidence that Jesus was establishing His kingdom through the disciples.\n \u0026ldquo;It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.\u0026rdquo; (Acts 4:10)\n It is this third aspect of the Supper which is perhaps most misunderstood and challenging to embrace. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a problem if we could simply see the Supper as looking forward to the Wedding Supper of the Lamb in Revelation 19:9, but Jesus does not give us that option (although that is how most Christians actually take it). Jesus did not put off \u0026ldquo;eating again until the kingdom comes\u0026rdquo; to the second coming. He got on with it as soon as He rose from the dead. The \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; to which the supper looks has already arrived. The Kingdom has come and Jesus is the King.\nMost of us live as if Jesus came to start a resistance movement rather than to announce His Kingdom. This is a huge subject in itself and here is not the place to explore it. But given that the Gospel is the announcement of the Kingdom, we must recognise that the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Supper is therefore also a celebration and proclamation of its presence and not merely an anticipation of a far-off dream.\nThere is an element that, for the moment, is still in the future - Paul said: \u0026ldquo;Whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord\u0026rsquo;s death until he comes.\u0026rdquo; (1 Cor 11:26). But we must not read this as if the new end that Jesus gives to the Supper is a distant dream \u0026ndash; the victorious second coming of Jesus. Yes, that is there in part, and there are aspects of the new end which remain to be inherited in their fullness. But the radical new end that Jesus has given the Supper is the Gospel itself \u0026ndash; the announcement that the Kingdom of God has come! Jesus has met us on the journey and brought our inheritance into our present.\nJesus is King, here today, on this earth. And it is our commission to make that fact known and invite people to take part. We are not a resistance movement waiting for the D-Day landings; they have already taken place and we are commissioned to take the ground that Jesus has won and tear down the machinery of oppression that continues to intimidate and enslave those who are ignorant of the new Kingdom. Our discipleship consists of laying hold of our inheritance and working it out in the here and now.\nJesus has given the Supper new meaning, and to share in the Supper is to share primarily in a celebration \u0026ndash; celebration of the New Covenant, celebration of the sustaining presence of Jesus and our union with Him, celebration of His guiding presence with us along the way and celebration of the present reality of God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom on earth and our inheritance of every blessing in Christ.\nOf course, along with the celebration there is also recognition of the cost of our inheritance in Christ\u0026rsquo;s suffering (of which the scriptures make very little) but also, more significantly, we recognise our incomplete comprehension and experience of the Kingdom of God. We continue to long for and pray for the Kingdom to come on earth as it is in Heaven.\nThis then, is the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Supper; His remodelling of the Passover supper.\nIn part 2 we will consider the practice of the Supper and some other aspects of its meaning.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bd9143f36942f5492f9a5f2cc82f1d04","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/breaking-bread-part-1/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/breaking-bread-part-1/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Breaking Bread \u0026ndash; Part 1 \u0026ndash; The New Passover Supper The Jewish background to the Last Supper When Jesus instituted the last supper, he did not invent something new, but fulfilled an existing celebration, the Passover supper.","tags":null,"title":"Breaking Bread - Part 1","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Breaking Bread \u0026ndash; Part 1 \u0026ndash; The New Passover Supper Luke 22:7-13 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, \u0026ldquo;Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Where do you want us to prepare for it?\u0026rdquo; they asked. He replied, \u0026ldquo;As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, and say to the owner of the house, \u0026lsquo;The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\u0026rsquo; He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.\u0026rdquo; They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.\nJesus told Peter and John to prepare for the Passover meal and they asked Him where it should be. His answer was elaborate and detailed.\nIt is clear from this that Jesus intended that the celebration should be properly prepared and also that its location really mattered. Either Jesus Himself had arranged the place or, as seems likely, the Holy Spirit made the arrangements having given directions to both Jesus and the owner of the upper room.\nWhen we compare this to the current usual practice of breaking bread in a church service, two contrasts are immediately obvious: firstly the preparation involved in sharing a piece of bread and a cup of wine is insignificant compared with a meal, and secondly the location in a church service is entirely different from in a family room. Jesus could easily have located the meal in the temple court in view of its great significance and connection with temple sacrifices. Or he could have located it in a synagogue in nearby Bethel where he was known and loved. But Jesus intended that it should be in a secular space, in an ordinary home. We have got so used to \u0026quot;breaking bread\u0026quot; in a church service that it is hard for us to think about this occasion as the disciple would have. We get a much better idea if we think of celebrating Christmas. Like Christmas, Passover was a major annual celebration. The meal was a central and essential part. You could not begin to think of celebrating it without a big carefully prepared meal. Neither would it occur to you to have your Christmas meal in church, despite it being a celebration of Jesus' birth. Neither would you think of joining in with a dozen other families to have a big joint affair. You would hopefully want to invite one or two lonely people to join in with you, or you might want to do something especially for lonely people. But you would want it to be as \u0026quot;authentic\u0026quot; as possible \u0026ndash; a great meal with a family feel and lots of conversation and maybe some games. Neither would you dream of asking a priest to officiate over the celebration. Passover was not Christmas, but I think it was a lot closer to Christmas than it is to \u0026quot;breaking bread\u0026quot; in a church service.\nIt was therefore natural for the disciples to ask about its preparation and location. They were not at home, so needed to find somewhere they could celebrate. They found a \u0026quot;man of peace\u0026quot; to offer his home. He was not someone the disciples knew, but he welcomed them. No doubt he and his household helped the disciples cook the meal, prepare the room and witnessed their celebration. It seems likely that he went on to become a disciple.\nLuke 22:14-15 When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. And he said to them, \u0026ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.\u0026quot;\nTo the disciples, this was just another Passover celebration, one of a lifetime of such annual celebrations. But for Jesus this was special. How long had Jesus \u0026quot;eagerly desired to eat this Passover\u0026quot; with them? Since leaving Galilee on their way to the festival in Jerusalem?\n\u0026quot;As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.\u0026quot; (Luke 9:51)\nOr was it since the very beginning of His ministry, when at the wedding in Cana He said to Mary, \u0026quot;My hour has not yet come\u0026quot;? Or had Jesus been looking forward to this meal since the original Passover back at the beginning of Israel's history? Or perhaps since the Fall or the very dawn of creation?\nThe point is that for Jesus this was not a Passover celebration but the Passover celebration, to which all previous ones had been pointing. Judgement has been lifted from God's people and would now and forever pass over them as Jesus Himself becomes our righteousness.\nWe can only imagine what it must have been like for Jesus to celebrate this meal with a bunch of people who had no idea of its eternal significance. I can imagine Him wishing that Elijah and Moses, who he shared with at the Transfiguration, could have been there. He must have longed to talk about the big-picture of God's eternal purposes and the true meaning of Passover and the huge significance of the New Covenant. But instead the disciples kept bringing the focus of conversation back to themselves \u0026ndash; who would betray Jesus, who was the greatest, who would never deny Jesus...\nLuke 22:15-19 And he said to them, \u0026ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. (16) For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.\u0026rdquo; After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, \u0026ldquo;Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u0026rdquo; And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u0026ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.\u0026rdquo;\nJesus again emphasises how unique this occasion is by telling the disciples that this meal and this drink (v17) would be His last until the Kingdom had come. He wanted the disciples to understand that this was a turning point in history that would usher in the Kingdom that they had spent the previous three years announcing and demonstrating. He is surely also telling them that the terrible events about to unfold are not the end, but the fulfilment of the Passover they had been celebrating for years without properly understanding it.\nJesus did not have to wait long before the Passover was fulfilled in His death on the cross. One of His first acts after His resurrection was to eat with his disciples \u0026ndash; something that Luke makes a point of recording:\nActs 10:48 \u0026quot;He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen\u0026mdash;by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.\u0026quot;\nThe point of course is that the Passover is now fulfilled and the Kingdom has come. We are forever delivered from the kingdom of darkness into the Kingdom of Light. Up to this point the Passover had been both a reminder of past deliverance and also a promise of future deliverance. But that future deliverance had now come and there was no longer a need to look back to the original Passover. This new Passover was not something to be remembered, but to be lived and experienced afresh each day.\nLuke 22:15-19 And he said to them, \u0026ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.\u0026rdquo; (17) After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, \u0026ldquo;Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u0026rdquo; And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u0026ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.\u0026rdquo;\nJesus takes the bread and the cup and gives thanks. This is the thanksgiving before the meal (saying grace as we might call it). He then tells the disciples to divide it among themselves. I think this instruction was intentional and important. He deliberately gave the disciples responsibility to share the food out because it created an opportunity for heart attitudes to be revealed \u0026ndash; for good or for bad. He then used it as an opportunity for teaching them about servanthood (vv24-30).\nLater in the NT we see this working out amongst another group of disciples:\n1 Corinthians 11:17-22 In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God\u0026rsquo;s approval. So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Supper you eat, for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. Don\u0026rsquo;t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!\nFor various reasons the traditional churches stopped having a meal when celebrating the Lord's supper. One of the reasons given is because Paul writes:\n 1 Corinthians 14:40 \u0026quot;But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.\u0026quot;\n A meal usually involves a certain degree of disorderliness, especially compared to a liturgical service. By leaving the meal out, so that all you have is the thanksgiving, you certainly have something more orderly. But is this what Jesus wants? Do we really think that God is concerned with orderliness in our services \u0026ndash; or is His concern the attitudes of our hearts that give rise to disorderliness? Remember that Jesus' own Last Supper was a proper meal, with lively discussion and it also resulted in a certain amount of argument.\nThere is no suggestion that Jesus was embarrassed at the disorderliness of His meal, or that Paul though it would be better to leave the meal out. For both Jesus and Paul, their response to the bad attitudes that emerged from the meal was to address the heart attitudes. The meal is an important aspect of discipleship \u0026ndash; it is an opportunity to show interest and concern for one another, to talk about Jesus, to serve one another. It is also an opportunity for selfishness and bad attitudes to be seen so that the deeper needs of the community can be identified and addressed.\nI suggest therefore that both the meal, and the instruction that the members should share it amongst themselves, are important aspects of what Jesus instructed us to do together. Leaving these aspects out removes the opportunity for discipleship.\nLuke 22:15-19 And he said to them, \u0026ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.\u0026rdquo; After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, \u0026ldquo;Take this and divide it among you. (18) For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u0026quot; And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u0026ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.\u0026rdquo;\nWe have already seen that Jesus ate and drank with the disciples and many others after the resurrection, so we can take those meals as proof that Jesus considered that His Kingdom had indeed come.\nLuke 22:15-19 And he said to them, \u0026ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.\u0026rdquo; After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, \u0026ldquo;Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u0026rdquo; (19) And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u0026ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.\u0026quot;\nJesus now introduces a completely new idea into the Passover meal. Jesus points to the bread they are sharing and eating, not the Passover lamb! Jesus was the Passover Lamb (as John the Baptist recognised \u0026ndash; John 1:29 \u0026ldquo;Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\u0026quot;) so we would expect Jesus to say \u0026quot;This lamb is My Body broken for you\u0026quot; but instead He points to the bread. He calls the bread \u0026quot;My body\u0026quot; but He doesn't say it is broken for them, but given for them. This is clearly a reference to what He had previously said about being the Bread of Life that the Father gave:\n John 6:32-59 \u0026quot;My Father gives you the true bread from heaven ... I am the bread of life ... This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world ... my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink ... The words I have spoken to you\u0026mdash;they are full of the Spirit and life.\u0026quot;\n Here Jesus tells us that He Himself is the food and drink we need to sustain us in life. Jesus clearly means His teaching and His example and not just His sacrificial death \u0026ndash; \u0026quot;[My] words ... are full of the Spirit and life\u0026quot;. So we conclude that in the Last Supper Jesus offered the bread as a symbol and reminder of His life and teachings, not just His death. It is remarkable that Jesus never even mentioned the Passover Lamb.\nThe fact that Jesus diverts attention towards the bread suggests to me that He intended the focus of the meal to be a remembrance of His life and teachings, rather than dwelling on His death.\nA further indication of this is His use of the phrase \u0026quot;do this in remembrance of me.\u0026quot; It is inconceivable that Jesus was concerned that we might forget that He died for us unless we regularly broke-bread in order to remember it! Think about this. Do you think we need to break bread to stop us forgetting that Jesus died? The Salvation Army don't celebrate the Last Supper but they have not forgotten the Cross. The idea that we need to celebrate the Last Supper lest we forget the Cross is bizarre and ridiculous. That is not what remembrance of the dead is for. People do not remember the dead to remember their death, but to remember their lives.\nThe purpose of celebrating the last supper is not to remind us that Jesus died for us, but why He died. His toast at the end of the meal (Luke 22:20) tells us what Jesus wanted us to remember \u0026ndash; the New Covenant. In other words the celebration is about His life in us now, not His death for us 2000 years ago.\n\u0026quot;Do this in remembrance of me\u0026quot; is very likely a reference to the Jewish practice of sharing bread and wine in remembrance of the life of someone who has died:\n Jeremiah 16:4,7(NKJV) \u0026quot;they shall not be lamented nor shall they be buried ... Nor shall men break bread in mourning for them, to comfort them for the dead; nor shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or their mother.\u0026quot;\n Jeremiah is writing about a terrible judgement to come where so many will die that they will be left unburied and un-mourned for. But what we learn is that the custom was to break bread and share a cup of consolation when someone died (the NIV is not so clear). Jesus adds this custom to the Passover celebration at the Last Supper because this meal is not just the remembrance of deliverance, but the remembrance of an extraordinary life. Whenever people remember their dead, they remember their lives, not the details of their death. That is surely what Jesus intends for us. We are to feed on His word and His example and on His living presence with us, remembering that in His death He has not left us as orphans, but He is forever with us (Matt 28:20) and is coming again in Glory.\nThe practice of focussing on the death of Jesus when we celebrate the Last Supper is, I believe, missing the point. It is His Life that feeds us, not His death. It seems to me that the focus of conversation when we celebrate the Last Supper should be the words and life of Jesus and His present effect on our lives. This is made even clearer in the next verse in Luke's account:\n Luke 22:20 In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \u0026ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\u0026quot;\n After they had shared both the meal and their conversation, Jesus raised the cup in a similar way that we would propose a toast after a special meal. \u0026ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\u0026quot; This is the first clear reference in the meal to His death.\nBut notice that Jesus does not say \u0026ldquo;This cup is My blood which is poured out for you\u0026quot; but \u0026ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\u0026quot; Jesus is drawing our attention to the New Covenant, and not dwelling on His death.\nThe Law of Moses was written on stone tablets, but Jesus' New Covenant was to be written on our hearts by the Holy Spirit:\n Jeremiah 31:31-34 \u0026ldquo;Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant ... I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people ... they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.\u0026rdquo;\nLuke 22:20 \u0026ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\u0026quot;\n This is what Jesus was \u0026quot;toasting\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; the fact that we can now all know the Lord ourselves through the Spirit. Jesus says to celebrate that He gave Himself for us. Jesus is saying, \u0026quot;Don't you ever forget what I have accomplished for you. Don't go back to the Law. Don't go back to slavery. Don't forget that I am with you always and alive forevermore. Don't forget that you are seated with me in the heavenly places to rule with me in My Kingdom. That is why after the meal Jesus said to them:\n Luke 22:29-30 \u0026quot;I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\u0026quot;\n This is the point and purpose of celebrating the Last Supper \u0026quot;in remembrance of me\u0026quot;.\n John 13:4-12 He got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him ... When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place.\n The washing of the disciple's feet seems to have been the way that Jesus responded to the argument that Luke tells us broke out:\n Luke 22:24 A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.\n 21But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. 22The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that man who betrays him!\u0026rdquo; 23They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.\n24A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. 25Jesus said to them, \u0026ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. 26But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. 27For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. 28You are those who have stood by me in my trials. 29And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, 30so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\nThe taking of this second cup was a quite separate act from the thanksgiving and sharing that took place at the start of the meal. Paul also makes the distinction between these two acts:\n 1 Cor 11:23-25 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, \u0026ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.\u0026rdquo; In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, \u0026ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.\u0026rdquo;\n**^26 ^**For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord\u0026rsquo;s death till He comes.\n The Jewish background to the Last Supper When Jesus instituted the last supper, he did not invent something new, but fulfilled an existing celebration, the Passover supper. This meal had a special quality that sets it apart from nearly all other celebrations. Birthday parties, anniversary meals and reunions all look back to some past event. Graduation parties, retirement parties, election parties, last-night parties and so on all celebrate a recent event. A barbeque might simply be celebrating family and friendship and perhaps a rare but glorious summer evening.\nAll of these elements are in the Passover Supper, but there is another element which makes the Passover unique; it also celebrates a future event. It looks forward to the coming Kingdom of God. The Israelites were delivered in the original Passover from the judgement meted out on their Egyptian \u0026ldquo;hosts\u0026rdquo; so that they could embark on a journey towards a liberated and blessed future in the Promised Land. Each year as they journeyed they celebrated the Passover meal looking back to its beginning and forward to its completion. Then, when later generations settled in that land, they continued to celebrate the Passover, yet still looking both backwards and forwards. They enjoyed and celebrated what they now possessed \u0026ndash; which their forbears could only dream about - but they also looked forward to a more complete experience of God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom when the earth would be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea (Hab 2:14).\nThe Passover meal was a joining together of past and future events that gave meaning to the present. It celebrated an identity as God\u0026rsquo;s people, a calling to bring Light to the world , a deliverance from slavery to darkness, a journey to inherit God\u0026rsquo;s promises, the present blessing of God\u0026rsquo;s presence and the assurance of a place in God\u0026rsquo;s glorious eternal fully expressed Kingdom. All of this was encompassed in the Passover.\nAlthough originally this was celebrated just once a year, by Jesus' day it was common practice to celebrate this in the home at least once a week, if not at every main meal.\nTo the Jew every meal was a sacred participation in the gifts of God\u0026rsquo;s bountiful creation. Thanksgivings were offered before and after each meal, understanding the food and drink as being a means of communion with God and with one another. The blessing and breaking of the common loaf formally opened the act of fellowship. On special occasions the meal was concluded with a cup of mingled wine and water which was blessed and passed round. The thanksgiving over the cup brought together the past, the present and the future, by praising God for His provision, remembering His redemptive action in history and praying for the coming of His kingdom.\nJesus' redefinition of the Passover Meal Jesus redefined the Passover meal, giving it a new beginning, a new middle and a new end. It is still a meal celebrating the journey of God\u0026rsquo;s people; it is still about our identity, our calling, our deliverance our journey and our inheritance. But now Jesus Himself is all of those things. He is the beginning, the journey and the end.\nHe Himself is our identity (\u0026ldquo;the church is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.\u0026rdquo; Eph 1:23), He is the Light we are called to bring to the world, He is our deliverer, He is our sustenance and our inheritance, He is eternally present with us, He is our hope. And all of this, not as a memory of the past or as a dream for the future but present in reality with us now. The architect of the Journey has come to accompany us and to start sharing out the rewards of its completion.\nJesus gave the Passover meal a new beginning \u0026ndash; the Cross. Jesus came announcing the arrival of the long-awaited Kingdom of God:\n\u0026ldquo;The time has come,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!\u0026rdquo; (Mark 1:15).\nAlthough Jesus both announced and demonstrated the presence of the Kingdom and claimed to have bound the strong man and was now plundering his goods, it seems that all of that was a kind of pre-view to the event by which He became King and bound the strong man. The Cross was Jesus' glorification and the moment of Satan\u0026rsquo;s defeat. As He approached Jerusalem at the beginning of His final week Jesus said,\n\u0026ldquo;The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified. Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain\u0026rdquo; ... \u0026quot; Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to Myself.\u0026rdquo; (John 12:23-24, 31-32)\nAnd so, when the time came for Him to become the King of God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom, the time of His glorification, when He would be \u0026ldquo;lifted up\u0026rdquo; on the cross, Jesus celebrated the Passover meal:\nAnd he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u0026ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.\u0026rdquo; In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \u0026ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you\u0026rdquo; (Luke 22:19-20).\nIt is notable that the Gospel writers make very little attempt to explain the logic of the Cross. Why Jesus had to die, how His death established the New Covenant, how His death obtained forgiveness of sins and so on \u0026ndash; such questions that seem to occupy so much teaching and preaching and scholarly writing and debate and disagreement \u0026ndash; get scant attention in the Gospels. The mechanism of the new beginning is not part of the Supper, only its celebration.\nJesus gives the Passover meal a new beginning \u0026ndash; the Cross. The remembrance part of the meal is focused on the self-giving of Jesus as the inauguration of a new covenant. It is not a remembrance of cruel injustice, nor of the cost of our sin and rebellion; it is not a remembrance of the example of Love Jesus gave us. Of course we cannot forget any of those things, but they are not what Jesus said to remember. Jesus commands us to remember the start of our new covenant relationship with God our Father. He gave the supper a new beginning.\nJesus gave the Passover meal a new middle \u0026ndash; feasting on Him. The supper is a celebration of a new start, but is also more than that. We don't just break the bread, we eat it. We pour out the wine and then we drink it. As well as a remembrance of the start it is also nourishment for the journey. And the journey itself is new.\nThe presence of God with us on the journey has a new depth and reality. Jesus promised he would not leave us orphaned when He was glorified on the cross. He promised to be with us always, and that the eternal Godhead would make their home in us. We do not feast alone, merely looking forward to a future real presence. Rather, just like with the disciples on the road to Emmaus, Jesus accompanies us on the journey and celebrates the Supper with us. But even more than that, He Himself is the supper!\n\u0026quot;For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them\u0026quot; (John 6:55-56)\nJesus is the real food that God gives us to sustain us on our journey towards our inheritance. This is in contrast to the symbolic foods of Manna, the Passover lamb and the offerings in the Law which were also eaten. Jesus is the reality to which these things pointed. But Jesus is also real food in contrast to the many things people crave to feed their impoverished souls \u0026ndash; wealth, power, popularity, sex. And even, we might say, Jesus is the real food in contrast to the bread and wine of the Supper, which of themselves are only symbols of Him. Notice how Jesus stresses real union with Him: \u0026quot;they in Me, and I in them\u0026quot; - words He repeats after the Supper and again in His prayer before the cross:\n\u0026quot;I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.\u0026quot; (John 14:20)\n\u0026quot;that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us ... that they may be one as we are one\u0026mdash; I in them and you in me (John 17:21-23)\nWhen Jesus told the people that they must eat His flesh and drink His blood, He was not telling them to share the broken bread and poured out wine of the Lord's supper; He was talking about being one with Him; sharing His life and identity:\n\u0026quot;If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.\u0026quot; (John 15:5)\nSo Jesus gave Himself as the New Covenant which we remember as the start of our journey, and He also gives Himself to us as our daily bread for the journey, sustaining our soul and spirit. We feast on Him.\nBut we need more than sustenance along the journey. We also need guidance and companionship and comfort and motivation. Jesus is all of these as well (Jn 14:16,23,26, 16:13, Matt 28:20). Jesus gave the Supper a new middle.\nJesus gave the Passover meal a new end \u0026ndash; His Kingdom on earth. Jesus gave the Supper a new beginning and a new middle. But as we have seen, the uniqueness of the Passover meal was in that it also looked forward to an assured future; and Jesus gave the supper a new end. He said:\n\u0026ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.\u0026rdquo; After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, \u0026ldquo;Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\u0026rdquo; (Luke 22:15-18. See also Matt 26:29 and Mark 14:25)\nWe do not have to wait for long! On the day of the resurrection Jesus ate fish with the disciples, then broke bread on the road to Emmaus, and shared breakfast with the disciples on the shores of Galilee, and according to Peter, Jesus ate and drank with many other witnesses of the resurrection (Acts 10:41). The fact that Jesus ate and drank with so many after the resurrection shows us that the Kingdom of God has indeed come.\nAnd the fifth gospel, Acts, bears powerful testimony that the Kingdom has indeed come. All the leaders in Jerusalem that had conspired together to kill Jesus were confronted with the irrefutable evidence that Jesus was establishing His kingdom through the disciples.\n\u0026ldquo;It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.\u0026rdquo; (Acts 4:10)\nIt is this third aspect of the Supper which is perhaps most misunderstood and challenging to embrace. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a problem if we could simply see the Supper as looking forward to the Wedding Supper of the Lamb in Revelation 19:9, but Jesus does not give us that option (although that is how most Christians actually take it). Jesus did not put off \u0026ldquo;eating again until the kingdom comes\u0026rdquo; to the second coming. He got on with it as soon as He rose from the dead. The \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; to which the supper looks has already arrived. The Kingdom has come and Jesus is the King.\nMost of us live as if Jesus came to start a resistance movement rather than to announce His Kingdom. This is a huge subject in itself and here is not the place to explore it. But given that the Gospel is the announcement of the Kingdom, we must recognise that the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Supper is therefore also a celebration and proclamation of its presence and not merely an anticipation of a far-off dream.\nThere is an element that, for the moment, is still in the future - Paul said: \u0026ldquo;Whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord\u0026rsquo;s death until he comes.\u0026rdquo; (1 Cor 11:26). But we must not read this as if the new end that Jesus gives to the Supper is a distant dream \u0026ndash; the victorious second coming of Jesus. Yes, that is there in part, and there are aspects of the new end which remain to be inherited in their fullness. But the radical new end that Jesus has given the Supper is the Gospel itself \u0026ndash; the announcement that the Kingdom of God has come! Jesus has met us on the journey and brought our inheritance into our present.\nJesus is King, here today, on this earth. And it is our commission to make that fact known and invite people to take part. We are not a resistance movement waiting for the D-Day landings; they have already taken place and we are commissioned to take the ground that Jesus has won and tear down the machinery of oppression that continues to intimidate and enslave those who are ignorant of the new Kingdom. Our discipleship consists of laying hold of our inheritance and working it out in the here and now.\nJesus has given the Supper new meaning, and to share in the Supper is to share primarily in a celebration \u0026ndash; celebration of the New Covenant, celebration of the sustaining presence of Jesus and our union with Him, celebration of His guiding presence with us along the way and celebration of the present reality of God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom on earth and our inheritance of every blessing in Christ.\nOf course, along with the celebration there is also recognition of the cost of our inheritance in Christ\u0026rsquo;s suffering (of which the scriptures make very little) but also, more significantly, we recognise our incomplete comprehension and experience of the Kingdom of God. We continue to long for and pray for the Kingdom to come on earth as it is in Heaven.\nThis then, is the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Supper; His remodelling of the Passover supper.\nIn part 2 we will consider the practice of the Supper and some other aspects of its meaning.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"48c758bdb5fd25718ba082d64598af9c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/breaking-bread-part-1-revised/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/breaking-bread-part-1-revised/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Breaking Bread \u0026ndash; Part 1 \u0026ndash; The New Passover Supper Luke 22:7-13 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.

Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.\u0026quot; (Mk 10:42-44 NIV)\n Leading by Example Kingdom leadership depends not upon authority and duty but on vision, inspiration, empowerment and love:\n \u0026ldquo;Be shepherds of God\u0026rsquo;s flock that is under your care, serving as overseers\u0026mdash;not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.\u0026rdquo; (1Pe 5:2-4 NIV)\n\u0026ldquo;Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 11:1 NIV)\n We see here that the character of a leader is crucial, not just the ability to perform a task. In the Kingdom, example is the most important quality. If the person does not live what they tell others to do, they are not suitable for leadership. Leaders must lead by example.\nTo Achieve a Goal The leaders serve the members by helping them to achieve a goal they value. However well our leaders may agree with the principles of servant leadership, the fact remains that leaders tend to be strong willed, determined, ambitious and sometimes ruthless. Because of this leadership teams only function properly when they recognise that there is some worthwhile goal that can only be achieved through common and organised effort.\nMotivation through Envisioning Leadership service includes clearly explaining the reason for the task being performed and envisioning the team/church members so that they willingly give sufficient priority to the required activities. Servant leadership does not include coercing members to do what they don't want to do.\nTaking the Problem to Jesus If people are not willing to participate in the way the leader wishes then the leader must go back to Jesus with the problem. Either the leader\u0026rsquo;s goal or its timing is wrong, or they have failed to share the vision for the goal clearly enough, or else the person is inappropriate for the team.\nI think we see this with the Transfiguration (Matt 17). Jesus had a problem getting through to His disciples. He was trying to get them to see that He truly was God's Son, and was pleased with Peter's response:\n \u0026ldquo;Who do you say I am?\u0026rdquo; Simon Peter answered, \u0026ldquo;You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\u0026rdquo; Jesus replied, \u0026ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. (Matt 16:15-17)\n On that foundation, He then tried to tell them about the cross, but they would not listen:\n From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. \u0026ldquo;Never, Lord!\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;This shall never happen to you!\u0026rdquo; Jesus turned and said to Peter, \u0026ldquo;Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 16:21-23)\n Jesus had a problem. His disciples would not accept what Jesus was saying. Even Peter who said he believed Jesus was God's Son was refusing to listen to what Jesus was trying to tell him. Jesus took that problem to the Father who said, \u0026quot;OK. I'll have a chat with them.\u0026quot; This is what happened:\n A bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, \u0026ldquo;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!\u0026rdquo; (Matt 17:5)\n That is our only resort if people do not get what we are trying to say. We make our appeal to them, and then must leave it to God to speak into their hearts. In the meantime we must continue to try and lead by example.\nForming a Leadership Team Within a Church The fundamental question in forming a leadership team within a church is \u0026quot;Are we trying to raise servants to support the church activities, or leaders who are expected to hear and obey Jesus?\u0026quot;\nIf you are looking for servants to support the church activities you will look for\n  People who agree with you\n  Compliant people who tend not to argue\n  People with appropriate skills\n  People others will respect and obey\n  If you are looking for Kingdom leaders you will look for\n  People with a passion for Christ\n  People who hear God for themselves\n  People who question what is being said and done\n  People who take risks\n  People who are not swayed by what others think of them\n  People with a growing sense of their own calling\n  People whose passion, focus and direction is compatible but different from ours\n  Gathering and promoting Kingdom leaders within a church is often a real challenge to the existing leadership \u0026ndash; one which few leaders are prepared to embrace. As a consequence, church leadership teams tend to be management teams, serving the lead-leader and the church program.\nForming a Leadership Team across Churches The fundamental question in forming a leadership team between churches is \u0026quot;What is this for?\u0026quot; Here are some reasons church leaders meet together:\n  Jesus prayed for our unity in John 17\n  There is some joint project they are involved in\n  They want to learn from other churches\n  Leadership is lonely and they want the companionship or support of other leaders\n  They want to be part of something bigger (prestige)\n  They want to influence other churches\n  They want to build a \u0026quot;kingdom\u0026quot; of relating churches\n  Whatever the reason is, it must be rooted in the Kingdom with Jesus as the head. \u0026quot;It just seemed like a good thing to do\u0026quot; is not good enough. What is the point in a \u0026quot;talking shop\u0026quot; that achieves nothing?\nGenuine cooperation between church leaders is often difficult to achieve. The problem is that they are all leaders and not used to being led. Worthwhile cooperation between leaders only occurs when they recognise that a goal they value can only be achieved together.\nGetting a Team to Function The task of leading a leadership team is fundamentally one of identifying a common goal and envisioning the team so that they willingly subjugate their own priorities for the sake of this greater goal.\nA good starting point is simply to encourage leaders to share their experience with one another with the accepted aim of influencing one another to shape the direction of the church and its mission. The aim is not uniformity, but stronger and more effective diversity. Where there is a commitment to sharing, listening and learning, teams can work very well and become very open to the Holy Spirit\u0026rsquo;s leading.\nIdentify Jesus' Gifts of People For a leadership team to function effectively there needs to be a recognition and celebration of the different qualities and characters that each member brings. We must be clear that our unity is not in uniformity but in Christ. We are not all hands or feet, we are all different members of Christ's Body. So it is valuable to look at the various lists of gifts mentioned in the New Testament and to try and identify each other's gifting (Rom 12, 1 Cor 12, Eph 4). These lists are clearly illustrative rather than exhaustive. People may have gifts that are not listed in these passages or which are better described in some other way. The point is that they should be recognised, celebrated, encouraged and valued.\nHeld Together by Love The first and greatest commandment Jesus gave us is to love one another. According to Paul in Ephesians 4:16, the purpose of Jesus' gifts of leadership are to enable the \u0026quot;the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, to grow and build itself up in love, as each part does its work.\u0026quot;\nLove is nowhere more important than in a leadership team. If the leadership team cannot give an example of love then we might as well give up and go home! Do you think that Jesus is impressed by \u0026quot;We led very well in all sorts of ways; but we never managed to love one another\u0026quot;?\nLove requires openness and honesty. Leaders can find this difficult if they are used to trying to project an impressive image. We see this problem recurring throughout the New Testament. Only if we walk in the light with each other can we truly have fellowship in love (1 Jn 1:7).\nGenuine Friendship The call to love one another cannot be sanitised by saying it is a call to acting in loving ways. We are called to deep unity in love, to brotherly love, to carrying one another's burdens. Look at the way Paul describes this love in 1 Cor 13:\n \u0026quot;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\u0026quot;\n That is not just intended for couples getting married! It is supposed to describe leadership teams as well. This requires genuine friendship and not just working relationships. It is totally unrealistic to suppose that such love can exist where the only interaction is in dealing with church administration. Leadership teams are an \u0026quot;artificial family\u0026quot; in the sense that the people are brought together for leadership reasons rather than natural friendship. But that does not excuse the team from friendship. If the team truly believes that their first calling is to lead by example in love for one another, before they can lead in any other meaningful way, then forming trusting and accepting friendships will be an early priority.\nSharing openly about ourselves and listening carefully to what other say to us within the leadership team is how love is established.\nJars of Clay Perhaps one of the more perplexing ways of God is that He purposely hides His presence in unimpressive people:\n But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. (2 Cor 4:7-10)\n Here Paul seems to be thinking about his vulnerability to oppressive troubles such as the many unjust accusations he faced and the physical beatings and difficult circumstances he endured. This seems incompatible with the Gospel of the Kingdom announcing Jesus as the present ruling King who had defeated and humiliated Satan. It is as if our experience betrays the emptiness of our Gospel message. But that is how God intends it to be! The Gospel is powerful because God is behind it, not because Christians have trouble-free lives.\nLater in this letter Paul tells us about another way he was unimpressive:\n Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, \u0026ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\u0026rdquo; Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ\u0026rsquo;s power may rest on me. (2 Cor 12:7-9)\n This trouble that tormented Paul was to keep him from becoming conceited, so I guess it was something that humiliated him; \u0026quot;my power is made perfect in weakness\u0026quot;. Perhaps it was an obsessive temptation or weakness that he succumbed to. Whatever it was, God in His wisdom allowed it to continue, even though humanly speaking it weakened Paul's witness. Paul was ashamed of it but God saw it as a protection from conceit.\nWe have to accept, and celebrate, that God is pleased to hide His treasure in jars of clay. We do not need to pretend to God or anyone else that we are better than we are. We are objects of His grace as well as His love. Although we strive to become more Christ-like, God is perfectly content to work through our flawed characters. We must therefore also accept each other as we are, because Christ has accepted us as we are (Eph 4:32).\nListening to One Another Numbers 22:21-34 tells us the amusing story of Balaam and his talking donkey. It is very instructive for leaders:\n \u0026quot;Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite officials.\u0026quot;\n Balaam (like many leaders) had got his mission fixed in his head and he was not going to be distracted:\n \u0026quot;But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the Lord stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat it to get it back on the road.\u0026quot;\n Balaam was so sure of where he was going, that he forgot to listen or look out for God's direction. Although his donkey could see the angel, Balaam could not! Balaam (like many leaders) assumed that anything or anyone who hindered his progress was wrong, and needed correcting.\nGod was patient and merciful towards Balaam and gave him multiple chances to recognise that God was trying to speak to him:\n \u0026quot;Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path through the vineyards, with walls on both sides. When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, it pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam\u0026rsquo;s foot against it. So he beat the donkey again. Then the angel of the Lord moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left. When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, it lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat it with his staff.\u0026quot;\n But Balaam pushed on ahead with his own plans, ignoring the unusual behaviour of his faithful donkey. Because Balaam would not listen to the \u0026quot;promptings of the Spirit\u0026quot; God spoke loud and clear through the donkey:\n \u0026quot;Then the Lord opened the donkey\u0026rsquo;s mouth, and it said to Balaam, \u0026ldquo;What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n But because it was only his donkey who spoke, and not some equally great \u0026quot;man of God\u0026quot;, Balaam dismissed the donkey's talk as stupid:\n \u0026quot;Balaam answered the donkey, \u0026ldquo;You have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n We all need to be prepared to listen to donkeys! Even though someone may seem insignificant to us, God may be trying to speak to us through them! We must always be listening out for God, no matter who or how He may choose to speak:\n \u0026quot;The donkey said to Balaam, \u0026ldquo;Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he said.\u0026quot;\n Fortunately for Balaam, God was persistent enough to overcome Balaam's stupidity:\n \u0026quot;Then the Lord opened Balaam\u0026rsquo;s eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.\u0026quot;\n What kind of a leader do you want to be? A dangerous and stupid leader like Balaam who would not listen when God spoke through his donkey? Or will you be someone who really listens to others, no matter who they are? Are you ready to hear God speak through children? unbelievers? sinners? people you disagree with? people you don't much like? people you think have bad theology or are living a bad example?\nIt is not about whether they are worthy enough to speak to you, but whether you are you humble enough to let God speak to you any way He chooses? Do you care enough about God's Kingdom to keep listening for His still small voice even after you have set out on your journey? Leaders must learn to listen!\nPlanning a Leadership Team Meeting Leadership team meetings, like all meetings, must be worthwhile. People have to make time for them and travel to the meeting place \u0026ndash; both of which might be very inconvenient. And yet there is a plague of worthless meetings in the global church! It is called meetingitis and it is more painful than appendicitis. One person defined leader's meetings as a room full of people waiting to go home! I once stopped a Sunday church service because it was a waste of time \u0026ndash; and I wish I had done it more often.\nIf you are not looking forward to meeting, then probably no one else is either, so do something about it. Either find a meaningful purpose or stop the meetings.\nSo how do you plan a meaningful leaders meeting? Well let's list some meaningful purposes:\n  Exploring and agreeing the purpose of the team\n  Agreeing the parameters of the team:\n  Meaningful relationships\n  Honesty, acceptance, listening, learning\n  Stop \u0026quot;red-herrings\u0026quot; before they escape\n  Listening to and obeying Jesus\n  Developing and promoting diversity\n  Releasing ministry\n    Learning from existing ministry and improving it\n  Stopping or changing ineffective ministry\n  Developing new areas of ministry\n  Supporting each other where help is needed\n  Sharing God stories and motivating each other to keep pursuing God\n  Exploring areas of teaching that could really help the church\n  Discuss popular beliefs or teaching that is considered unhelpful to the church\n  Sharing what Jesus is saying to each member of the team\n  Planning to plant churches and release leadership ministry\n  There should be enough there to help you plan for some really worthwhile meetings. But unless you plan the meetings they may still be frustrating and fruitless!\nHere are some tips to reduce the chances of a frustrating and fruitless meeting:\n  Make sure everyone knows the date, time and place well ahead of the meeting day.\n  Make sure everyone knows the purpose of the meeting well ahead of the meeting day.\n  Start on time.\n  Appoint a good chairman \u0026ndash; not necessarily the lead-leader.\n  Don't waste time on formalities, such as reading and approving reports and minutes. They should be distributed and read beforehand, and only \u0026quot;matters arising\u0026quot; brought up in the meeting.\n  Avoid doing any business in the meeting that can be done just as well with fewer people outside the meeting.\n  Stop \u0026quot;red herrings\u0026quot; getting away. Don't let side-issues distract the conversation from the main point being considered. This is firstly the responsibility of the chairman, but everyone should share this responsibility.\n  Make sure that decisions are made clearly, recorded accurately and responsibility for action delegated effectively. Decisions that are made and not acted on are a prime cause of frustration and wasted time.\n  If there is going to be a social part to the meeting, have it at the end and allow people to leave if they need to.\n  Some things to think about What kind of people would you like to have in your ideal leadership team?\nWho do you know that you would like to share leadership with?\nWhat would you like to do in your first five ideal leadership team meetings?\nIn pairs, find out the significant ways in which the other person has grown as a disciple of Jesus.\nExplore with them how you can benefit from their experience.\nWhat steps can you take to improve your leadership-team meeting experience?\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7e5e94f12360ec6ad7b663fb7a96a916","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/developing-leadership-teams/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/developing-leadership-teams/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Developing Leadership Teams present teaching relates specifically to developing leadership teams, and assumes that the leaders have embraced the principles set out in \u0026quot;Servant Leadership\u0026quot;.\nRelevant points from \u0026quot;Servant Leadership\u0026quot; Called to Serve Leaders and leadership teams are called to serve the people of God, not to rule over them:","tags":null,"title":"Developing Leadership Teams","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The good news of the kingdom of God: It starts with Healing Matthew 4:23; Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.\nIt proclaims the \u0026ldquo;good news of the kingdom\u0026rdquo;   heaven is coming to earth\n  the curse is reversed\n  people are reconciled to God\n  sins are forgiven\n  sickness is healed\n  the possessed are set free\n  the excluded are brought in\n  It includes Repentance Jn 8:31-36 \u0026ldquo;If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip; Jesus answered them, \u0026ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin. \u0026hellip; So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.\u0026rdquo;\nIt includes Jesus as the way and the truth John 10:9 I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.

(a leper, the centurions servant, Peter\u0026rsquo;s mother-in-law, Many demon-possessed and all who were sick, calms the storm, two demon-possessed men, a paralytic, girl raised from the dead, woman with issue of blood, two blind and a mute.) After this comes teaching about discipleship including the parables.\nMatthew 10:7-8 \u0026ldquo;And as you go, preach, saying, \u0026lsquo;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons.

He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favor.\u0026rdquo;\nLuke 4:43; But he said, \u0026quot;I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.\u0026quot;\nLuke 7:22 So he replied to the messengers, \u0026quot;Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.\nLuke 8:1; After this, Jesus travelled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,\nLuke 9:2 And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform healing. Isaiah 61, \u0026ldquo;preach good news to the poor\u0026rdquo;\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s Gospel Acts 8:12 But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.\n1Cor 15:1-5 Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you\u0026mdash;unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.\nPaul preached the Gospel of the Kingdom. The following passages all refer to the Paul:\nConfirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God (Acts 14:22).\nAnd he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God (Acts 19:8).\nAnd now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more (Acts 20:25).\nAnd when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening (Acts 28:23).\nAnd Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him (Acts 28:30-31).\nJustified by faith: The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector\nLuke 18:9\u0026ndash;14 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else Jesus told this parable: \u0026ldquo;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: \u0026lsquo;God, I thank you that I am not like other people\u0026mdash;robbers, evildoers, adulterers\u0026mdash;or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breasts and said, \u0026lsquo;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u0026rdquo;\nHe was a morally upright man, he kept the commandments Verse 12: \u0026ldquo;I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.\u0026rdquo; These are what you might call \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ceremonial\u0026rdquo; acts: fasting and tithing. \u0026ndash; a religiously devout man\nhe believed that this righteousness was the gift of God. Verse 11: \u0026ldquo;The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: \u0026lsquo;God, I thank you that I am not like other men.'\u0026rdquo;\nThe problem is not whether the man himself has produced the righteousness he has or whether God has produced it. The problem is: He trusts in it. This is his confidence. Verse 9: \u0026ldquo;[Jesus] also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous.\u0026rdquo; Now make sure you see what this is saying. It is not saying that he is trusting in himself to make himself righteous. No. He says explicitly he is thanking God for that. He is not trusting in himself to make himself righteous. He is trusting in himself that he is righteous with the righteousness that he believes God has worked in him. That is what he is trusting.\nWhen it came to justification \u0026mdash; for that is the issue, as verse 14 shows \u0026mdash; this man was trusting in the wrong thing. He was looking at the wrong basis for his righteousness before God. He was looking at the wrong ground for his righteousness before God. He was looking at the wrong person and the wrong righteousness. He was looking to his own righteousness \u0026mdash; and it was his, not because he created it, but because he acted it. It was not an alien righteousness. It was inherent in him. It was in his will and in his heart and in his actions. It was his, and it was put there, he believed, by God. That is what he was trusting in.\nHe is not presented as a legalist \u0026mdash; one who tries to earn his salvation. That is not the issue. One thing is the issue: This man was morally upright. He was religiously devout. He believed God had made him so. He gave thanks for it. And that is what he looked to and trusted in for his justifying righteousness before God \u0026mdash; for his justification. And he was dead wrong to do so.\nChrist our Righteousness \u0026ldquo;God made Christ to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of God\u0026rdquo; (2 Corinthians 5:21).\nBy trusting Christ alone, we are united to him. And because we are \u0026ldquo;in him,\u0026rdquo; what he is counts for us, his righteousness, his morality, his devoutness.\nPhilippians 3:9;\nRomans 3:28; 4:4-6; 5:18\u0026ndash;19; 10:3\u0026ndash;4;\n1 Corinthians 1:30;\nGalatians 2:16\nSettle it once and for all that the dozens of places in the Bible that make your good behavior the condition of your final salvation are a condition only as the fruit and confirmation of justification, not the ground of it. If you do not settle this, you will live in continual turmoil wondering what all those texts mean that say to Christians: \u0026ldquo;Those who do such things will not enter the kingdom of heaven\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 6:9). Don\u0026rsquo;t submit to that torment. Settle it. All the good that God requires of the justified is the fruit of justification by faith alone, never the ground of justification. Let the battle of your life be there. The battle to believe. Not the battle to perform.\nJesus says of those who are transformed in this way: \u0026ldquo;Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 13:43).\nA real Kingdom \u0026ldquo;Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 19:28; see also Luke 22:28-30).\nAfter God resurrected Jesus from the dead, the disciples had a burning question for Him: \u0026ldquo;Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, \u0026lsquo;Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?\u0026rsquo; And He said to them, \u0026lsquo;It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot; (Acts 1:6-7).\nThey obviously understood that a part of Jesus\u0026rsquo; mission involved a restoration of a literal kingdom, with Christ as ruler and the disciples reigning under Him. Jesus told them, however, that the timing of the establishing of that kingdom is known only to God the Father (Matthew 24:36).\n{width=\u0026ldquo;6.268055555555556in\u0026rdquo; height=\u0026ldquo;7.747316272965879in\u0026rdquo;}\n(Acts 8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31). The members of the early Church also put their focus on the coming Kingdom (Colossians 4:11; 2 Thessalonians 1:5).\n{width=\u0026ldquo;2.1354166666666665in\u0026rdquo; height=\u0026ldquo;1.0833333333333333in\u0026rdquo;}\n[John 10:10]{.ul} I am come that they might have life - and that they might have it more abundantly\nThe Gospel Jesus Preached\nThe Gospel Jesus preached was not a message about His person. He did not go about Galilee and Judea relating all the things He had done. Rather, He proclaimed a specific message from God the Father. The Apostle Peter stated: \u0026ldquo;The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached\u0026rdquo; ([Acts 10:36-37]{.ul}). The message Jesus brought was from the Father. It was sent to the children of Israel and was the fulfillment of a prophecy given in the book of Malachi. \u0026ldquo;Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts\u0026rdquo; ([Mal. 3:1]{.ul}). John the Baptist was the messenger who prepared the way.\nJesus Christ was the divine Messenger-the Messenger of The Covenant. The message Jesus brought-the Gospel-is the New Covenant message. Moses was the mediator of the Old Covenant, but Jesus Christ is the mediator of the New. The message Jesus brought is the New Testament Gospel. Mark tells us when this Gospel began: \u0026ldquo;The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God\u0026rdquo; ([Mark 1:1]{.ul}). John first came preaching the baptism of repentance. Then we read: \u0026ldquo;Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel\u0026rdquo; ([Mark 1:14-15]{.ul}). The Gospel Jesus brought is the one and only true Gospel. It was a message about the Kingdom of God.\nThe Gospel of Christ\nJesus said the Gospel He preached came from the Father. He said, \u0026ldquo;. . . I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak\u0026rdquo; ([John 12:49-50]{.ul}). The message sent from God the Father was the Good News of the Kingdom of God. Jesus Christ was the Spokesman-the Word that was made flesh and dwelt among us ([John 1:14]{.ul}). His Gospel ushered in an entirely new age. \u0026ldquo;The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it\u0026rdquo; ([Luke 16:16]{.ul}).\nJesus mentioned the Kingdom of God many times during His public ministry. Notice a few examples: \u0026ldquo;And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent\u0026rdquo; ([Luke 4:43]{.ul}). \u0026ldquo;And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people\u0026rdquo; ([Matt. 9:35]{.ul}). \u0026ldquo;But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you\u0026rdquo; ([Matt. 6:33]{.ul}). In the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer He included the request that we pray, \u0026ldquo;Thy kingdom come\u0026rdquo; ([Matt. 6:10]{.ul}).\nAre There Many Gospels?\nAbout twenty years after the death and resurrection of Christ, the Apostle Paul warned the Galatians: \u0026ldquo;I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ\u0026rdquo; ([Gal. 1:6-7]{.ul}). What was taking place is that the Gospel of Jesus Christ was being changed to a gospel about Christ, and His message was lost in the confusion. Paul warned: \u0026ldquo;But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed\u0026rdquo; ([Gal. 1:8-9]{.ul}).\nToday, many people do not know what the Gospel is. Rather, they believe a different gospel. They have lost sight of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God. When Jesus began His ministry He made it clear that to be saved it was necessary to believe the Gospel. His words were: \u0026ldquo;. . . The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel\u0026rdquo; ([Mark 1:15]{.ul}). His parting words of instruction to His apostles were: \u0026ldquo;. . . Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned\u0026rdquo; ([Mark 16:15-16]{.ul}). The apostles were commissioned to preach the Gospel. This Gospel was not a message about the Person of Christ; it was the message about the coming Kingdom of God.\nThis was the same message the Apostle Paul preached. Notice the following passages. They all refer to the Apostle Paul:\nConfirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God ([Acts 14:22]{.ul}).\nAnd he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God ([Acts 19:8]{.ul}).\nAnd now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more ([Acts 20:25]{.ul}).\nAnd when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening ([Acts 28:23]{.ul}).\nAnd Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him ([Acts 28:30-31]{.ul}).\nThere are not many gospels; there is only one true gospel-the Gospel of the Kingdom of God! This was the message that was consistently taught by Christ, by the apostles and New Testament evangelists ([Acts 8:12]{.ul}), and by the Apostle Paul.\nWhat Does the Word \u0026ldquo;Kingdom\u0026rdquo; Mean?\nJesus was not talking about something that was within the heart of man, nor was He talking about a church. He was talking about a literal kingdom. Any dictionary will tell you that a kingdom is a major territorial unit which has a monarchical form of government with a king or queen as its head. A kingdom consists of four things: (1) a king or head of state; (2) territory over which to rule; (3) laws by which to govern; and (4) subjects over which to rule. All of these requirements will be met when Jesus returns to establish His kingdom on this earth. Notice what the prophets foretold:\nFor unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this ([Isa. 9:6-7]{.ul}).\nI saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. . . . And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him ([Dan. 7:13-14]{.ul}, [27]{.ul}).\nAnd out of his [Christ\u0026rsquo;s] mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS ([Rev. 19:15-16]{.ul}).\nThe angel told His mother Mary: \u0026ldquo;And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David\u0026rdquo; ([Luke 1:31-32]{.ul}). When Jesus was asked by Pilate if He was a king, \u0026ldquo;. . . Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world. . . \u0026quot; ([John 18:37]{.ul}).\nJesus Christ will return to this earth to establish a literal kingdom-the Kingdom of God. Few people today seem to realize this aspect of Christ\u0026rsquo;s work. Many seem to believe that the Kingdom of God could not apply to this time of grace. In effect, they reject the Good News of the Kingdom of God; they do not believe the true Gospel! They refuse to believe in the coming wonderful world tomorrow. The Bible describes this coming time.\nAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more ([Isa. 2:2-4]{.ul}).\nConditions for Entering the Kingdom of God\nJesus came preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God. How may we enter into this marvelous kingdom? Jesus' instruction was, \u0026ldquo;repent and believe the Gospel\u0026rdquo; ([Mark 1:15]{.ul}). Jesus gave us two things to do. We must repent, and we must believe the Gospel. Believing the Gospel means we must also believe on Jesus Christ, the King of the coming Kingdom of God. He is not only our King, but our personal Saviour and great High Priest. Repentance means there has been a change of mind and heart in each individual who has accepted Christ. Accepting Christ as personal Savior means we recognize that Christ died for us, and that we must repent of wrong doing-of sin. To repent means to change the mind with respect to the Law of God; this change of mind leads to a change of life. We must repent of sin. What is sin? The Bible tells us: \u0026ldquo;Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law\u0026rdquo; ([1 John 3:4]{.ul}). Sin is the violation of the Law of God-the Ten Commandments. Jesus was once asked, \u0026ldquo;. . . Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\u0026rdquo; Jesus replied, \u0026ldquo;. . . if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments\u0026rdquo; ([Matt. 19:16-17]{.ul}). Jesus went on to explain that He was referring to the Ten Commandments.\nThe Ten Commandments summarize how to live right in the eyes of God. They show us how to manifest love to God and toward our fellow man. They show, in principle, the whole duty of living righteously. They show a way of life that leads to happiness, peace of mind, and joy. They show a manner of living that is contrary to human nature and to the customs and ways of this world. They show the way to eternal life. Jesus said these two principles are necessary for us to do in order to enter the Kingdom of God-repent and believe the Gospel!\nThe Spiritual Birth\nNicodemus, a Pharisee and leader of the Jews, came to Christ at night. Jesus told him, \u0026ldquo;. . . Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u0026rdquo; ([John 3:3]{.ul}). Jesus emphasized the Kingdom of God and told Nicodemus the most important aspect he needed to know in order to enter into that kingdom. Jesus said that unless one is born again he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. What did He mean? Nicodemus, bewildered, asked, \u0026ldquo;. . . How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother\u0026rsquo;s womb, and be born?\u0026rdquo; ([John 3:4]{.ul}). Nicodemus knew Jesus was talking about a literal birth. Jesus went on to explain: \u0026ldquo;. . . Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit\u0026rdquo; ([John 3:5-8]{.ul}). So, those born of the flesh are flesh, but those born of the spirit are spirit. The Apostle Paul said: \u0026ldquo;Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. . . \u0026quot; ([1 Cor. 15:50]{.ul}). The birth Jesus was talking about was the change from flesh to spirit-the change from mortality to immortality. Jesus was talking about the resurrection of the dead.\nPaul spoke of the resurrection. He said this of the physical body:\n. . . It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. . . . Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality ([1 Cor. 15:42-44]{.ul}, [50-53]{.ul}).\nJesus instructed Nicodemus that it is possible to be born again, not as a mortal flesh-and-blood baby, but as immortal spirit. Jesus said, God is a Spirit ([John 4:24]{.ul}). The Kingdom of God will be made up of those who are born of the Spirit. God created man in His own image-physically. Upon conversion-true repentance and belief in Christ- man receives only a measure of the Holy Spirit. In the resurrection those truly converted will be changed into spirit by that very Spirit dwelling in them. Paul wrote: \u0026ldquo;But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you\u0026rdquo; ([Rom. 8:11]{.ul}). Man, now created physically in God\u0026rsquo;s image, is in the process of being created into His image spiritually ([1 Cor. 15:49]{.ul}, [2 Cor 3:18]{.ul}, [Col. 3:10]{.ul}). Paul makes plain that while flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, yet by means of the resurrection those begotten by the Holy Spirit in this mortal life can, and will be, changed into immortality to be like God Himself ([1 John 3:2]{.ul}). This is the birth Jesus spoke of-the spiritual birth into the Kingdom of God. This is what the Gospel is all about!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"99793a774ba04d16057d0de5b73fdb33","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/did-jesus-preach-the-gospel/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/did-jesus-preach-the-gospel/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"The good news of the kingdom of God: It starts with Healing Matthew 4:23; Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.","tags":null,"title":"Did Jesus preach the gospel","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Spirit of Life Extract from \u0026quot;We make the road by walking\u0026quot;, Brian McLaren.\nPhilippians 1:20-30\nFor to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.\nAmong the Spirit\u0026rsquo;s many essential movements in our lives is this: to prepare us for the end of our lives, without fear.\nSo many us are afraid to even think about death, much less speak of it. That fear can enslave us and can rob us of so much aliveness. The Spirit moves within us to help us face death with hope, not fear . . . with quiet confidence, not anxiety \u0026lsquo;The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,\u0026rsquo; Paul said (Rom. 8:2), \u0026lsquo;has set you free from the law of sin and of death.\u0026rsquo;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a way to think about death. We often speak of God as the one who was, who is, and who is to come. The God who was holds all our past. The God who is surrounds us now. And the God who is to come will be there for us beyond this life as we know it. With that realisation in mind, death could never mean leaving God, because there is nowhere we can escape from God\u0026rsquo;s presence, as the psalmist said (139:7). Instead, death simply means leaving the presence of God in this little neighbourhood of history called the present. Through death, we join God in the vast, forever-expanding future, into which both past and present are forever taken up.\nDeath is merely a doorway, a passage from one way of living in God\u0026rsquo;s presence in the present to another way of living in God\u0026rsquo;s presence - in the open space of unseized possibility we call the future.\nTo be liberated from the fear of death \u0026mdash; think of how that would change your values, perspectives and actions. To believe that no good thing is lost, but that all goodness will be taken up and consummated in God \u0026mdash; think of how that frees you to do good without reservation. To participate in a network of relationships that isn\u0026rsquo;t limited by death in the slightest degree \u0026mdash; think of how that would make every person matter and how it would free you to live with boundless, loving aliveness.\nSo what might we expect to happen when we die? Nobody knows for sure, but in light of Jesus' death and resurrection, we can expect to experience death as a passage, like birth, the end of one life stage and the beginning of another. We don\u0026rsquo;t know how that passing will come ... like a slow slipping away in disease like a sudden jolt or shock in an accident. However it happens, we can expect to discover that we\u0026rsquo;re not falling out of life, but deeper into it.\nOn the other side, we can expect to experience as never before the unimaginable light or energy of God\u0026rsquo;s presence. We will enter into a goodness so good, a richness so rich, a holiness so holy, a mercy and love so strong and true that all of our evil, pride, lust, greed, resentment and fear will be instantly melted out of us. We will at that moment more fully understand how much we have been forgiven, and so we will more than ever be filled with love... love for God who forgives, and with God, love for everyone and everything that has like us been forgiven.\nWe can expect to feel a sense of reunion \u0026mdash; yes, with loved ones who have died, but also with our great-great-great-great-grand- parents and our thirty-second cousins a thousand times removed whose names we\u0026rsquo;ve never known but to whom we are in fact related. That sense of relatedness that we now feel with closest of kin will somehow be expanded to every person who has ever lived. And that sense of relatedness won\u0026rsquo;t stop with human beings, but will expand infinitely outwards to all of God\u0026rsquo;s creation. We can expect to feel the fullest, most exquisite sense of oneness and inter-relatedness and harmony - a sense of belonging and connection that we approached only vaguely or clumsily in our most ecstatic moments in this life.\nWe can expect to feel differently about our sufferings. We will see not the short-term pain that so preoccupied us on the past side of death, but instead the enduring virtue, courage and compassion that have been forged in us through each fall of the hammer on the anvil of pain. So we will bless our sufferings and feel about them as we feel about our pleasures now. What has been suffered or lost will feel weightless compared to the substance that has been gained.\nWe can expect to feel a limitless sense of \u0026lsquo;Ah yes, now I see\u0026rsquo;. What we longed for, reached for, touched but couldn\u0026rsquo;t grasp, and knew in part will then be so clear. And all our unfulfilled longing on this side of death will, we can expect, enrich and fulfil the having on that side of death. We can expect to feel as if we\u0026rsquo;re waking up from being half asleep, waking into an explosion of pure, utter gratitude as we suddenly and fully realise all we\u0026rsquo;ve had and taken for granted all along.\nYou may imagine that dying will be like diving or falling or stepping into a big wave at the beach. You will feel yourself lifted off your feet and taken up into a swirl and curl and spin more powerful than you can now imagine. But there will be no fear, because the motion and flow will be the dance of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The rising tide will be life and joy. The undertow will be love, and you will be drawn deeper and deeper in.\nWe normally don\u0026rsquo;t look forward to the process of dying, and most of us would be happy if the dying process is as short and painless as possible. But if we allow the Spirit to prepare us for dying by contemplating it in these ways, we can begin to under-stand the dual pull that Paul wrote about: \u0026lsquo;For me to live is Christ but to die is gain.\u0026rsquo; On the one hand, we feel a pull to stay here in this life, enjoying the light and love and goodness of God with so many people who are dear to us, with so much good work left to be done. On the other hand, we feel an equal and opposite pull towards the light and love and goodness of God experienced more directly beyond this life.\nMany of us remember the experience as children of \u0026lsquo;waiting your turn\u0026rsquo;; Maybe it was waiting your turn to ride a pony at the county fair, or waiting your turn to play a game, or waiting your turn to ride a sled down a hill in winter snow. Imagine the feeling of having had your turn on this Earth and having enjoyed it thoroughly. Now you are ready to step aside to let someone else have their turn. In that way, even dying can be an act of love and generosity: vacating space to make room for others, especially generations as yet unborn, just as others vacated their space so you could have your turn in this life. Perhaps the act of letting others have their turn will be one of our most mature and generous actions a fitting end to our adventure in this life. At that moment, it will be our turn to graduate into a new adventure, beyond all imagining.\nAs we walk this road, we not only remember the past, we also anticipate the future, which is described as a great banquet around God\u0026rsquo;s table of joy. When you pass from this life, do not be afraid. You will not pass into death. You will pass through death into a greater aliveness still \u0026mdash; the banquet of God. Trust God, and live.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5c46ef74b41d4c8cd4c04245f44b973e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/healing/dying/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/healing/dying/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Spirit of Life Extract from \u0026quot;We make the road by walking\u0026quot;, Brian McLaren.\nPhilippians 1:20-30\nFor to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.\nAmong the Spirit\u0026rsquo;s many essential movements in our lives is this: to prepare us for the end of our lives, without fear.","tags":null,"title":"Dying","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Elders and Apostles NT church leadership consists of Jesus the head, elders/leaders and the saints, who are the foot-soldiers of the church.\nPaul instructed Titus to appoint elders over the churches in his care. It is the New Testament norm for local churches to have one or more elders to care for it. But Paul warns not to appoint novice believers who lack maturity in their faith. The reason is that young believers are often eager to become elders because of the esteem it gives them. But Jesus shows us the true heart of an elder:\n\u0026ldquo;But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 9:36)\n\u0026ldquo;Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood. (Acts 20:28)\nAn elder should be a believer with a heart broken for the lost; moved with compassion for the captives and passionate about Jesus. Such a person is likely to lead a healthy church.\nIn addition to elders, God gives \u0026lsquo;gifts\u0026rsquo; of apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists and pastors to help equip the church for ministry (Eph 4). Although the NT does not make clear how these ministries related to the local church and mission, it seems that the 5-fold gifts spear-head and motivate church planting and lay the foundations of truth and practice for churches. Meanwhile, the elders/leaders and saints get on with the task of discipling and multiplying. No doubt some churches had resident ministry gifts whilst others received input from visiting ministries.\n1An elder is a man who is called and gifted by God, who with other elders has the responsibility for leading a local church. Scripture portrays him as a man who is:\n  Shaped by apostolic ministry\n  Able to lead himself\n  Able to lead his family\n  Able to lead his local church\n  The elder is responsible for the day-to-day discipleship of the church and is rightly concerned with the details of individual\u0026rsquo;s lives and the particular challenges and delights of living out the Kingdom in the community.\nSelf-control is the preeminent qualification for eldership and is the only thing Paul tells Timothy to teach young men! Learning to lead yourself is the key preparation necessary to lead others. If young people can win this battle early, then they will develop into fine leaders.2\nThe devil lays snares for elders! Every potential elder must honestly ask himself where his weak spots are. Where will the devil lay his snare? Pride is a common snare, but there may be others. Do not appoint elders hastily; examine their character and the fruit of their faith.\nAn elder should not be a novice, lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the same condemnation as the devil. Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. (1Tim 3:6-7)\nElders should be transparent. What you see is what you get. Their \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; means \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; and their \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo; means \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo;. Elders and deacons need to be people of pure hearts and open spirits whom you know you can trust. If they have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, do not entrust them with true riches.3\n\u0026ldquo;He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much. Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?\u0026rdquo; (Lk 16:10-11)\nElders must honour the priesthood of all believers and should therefore always seek the counsel and mind of those they lead and involve them in the process of decision-making.\nThe ministry gifts, especially the apostles and prophets, are called to have a bigger vision and wider perspective on what is happening. There tends to be a healthy tension between elders who want to strengthen their local work with more leaders, and the apostles who want to push those leaders out into new works. In addition, apostles and prophets are more likely to see the foundational significance of certain events and how they are responded to. This produces another healthy tension between the pragmatism of an elder and the relative idealism of an apostle or prophet. It is not that one is right and the other wrong, but that both voices and influences are needed. The elder has the God given responsibility to lead and care. The ministry gifts have the responsibility to provoke. For this reason elders need to be continually envisioned and equipped by apostles and their teams.\nTeachers will have particular gifting in understanding the breadth of truth in the scriptures, providing doctrinal perspective and balance. They help to reveal simple truths that so easily get obscured by tradition or worldly thinking. They help the saints to gain the confidence to search the scriptures for themselves and take both the meat and the milk of the word. They will not promote their own wisdom with new interpretations, but appeal to the simplicity of the gospel and the witness of the Spirit to bring clarity to the scriptures.\n  PJ Smyth, \u0026ldquo;The world needs more elders\u0026rdquo; P11 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n PJ Smyth, \u0026ldquo;The world needs more elders\u0026rdquo; P15 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n PJ Smyth, \u0026ldquo;The world needs more elders\u0026rdquo; P20 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"62dde50d5f5ca2ea765f64b483d23d15","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/elders-and-apostles/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/elders-and-apostles/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Elders and Apostles NT church leadership consists of Jesus the head, elders/leaders and the saints, who are the foot-soldiers of the church.\nPaul instructed Titus to appoint elders over the churches in his care.","tags":null,"title":"Elders and Apostles","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Ephesians 4 Ministries  So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. ... If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. ... As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 15:5-9)\nJesus told Peter to \u0026ldquo;Feed my lambs ... Take care of my sheep.\u0026rdquo;\nPastors are the food-bucket of the church.

(Jn 6:5-6)\nJesus commands us to apprentice disciples: \u0026ldquo;teach them to obey everything I have commanded you.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 28:20)\nTeachers are the aprons of the church, they say, \u0026ldquo;come on, I\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to do it...\u0026rdquo;\nThe Head Jesus gives apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers to the church, but which of these is the leader?\nThat is the same as saying \u0026ldquo;Jesus gives boots, ear-phones, stethoscope, food-bucket and aprons to the church.

If you give someone a gift to help them, the gift does not take control! The head is always the leader. The body\u0026rsquo;s proper functioning is the point. The gifts are simply aids for the body.\n ... we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. (Ephesians 4:15-16)\n The Foundation Earlier in Ephesians (2:20) Paul says that the Church is \u0026quot;built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets\u0026quot;. Proponents of \u0026quot;Apostolic\u0026quot; ministry have taken this to argue that local churches must be established by apostolic and prophetic ministry and should continue to have apostolic and prophetic oversite. But this is nothing to do with what Paul is saying. We must read this in its context:\n Eph 2:14-22 For he himself ... has made the two groups (Jews and Gentiles) one and has destroyed the dividing wall of hostility ... His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, ... and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, ... Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God\u0026rsquo;s people ... built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone...\nEph 3:4-6 You will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which ... has now been revealed by the Spirit to God\u0026rsquo;s holy apostles and prophets. This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body...\n The prophets Paul refers to are the New Testament prophets that understood the significance of the Old Testament prophets who prophesied that Abraham's blessing would be taken to the Gentiles. The apostles are Peter and James and Paul and those other early apostles who established from God that there was to be no divide between Jewish and Gentile believers. Gentile inclusion into the People of God is the foundation that has been laid and never needs to be re-laid.\nValuing the Ministry-Gifts Leaders should be able to identify at least some of these gifts within themselves and those in the leadership team. It is probably unhelpful to label one another in this way, but recognising and promoting and valuing these gifts is really important.\n  Which of these gifts do you recognise in your team?\n  Which are less well represented?\n  Is your team lop-sided or well balanced?\n  How can you strengthen the weaker areas?\n  Do you need to bring other people into the team?\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"99e56379cd0584d6ba93ad776ccecfdc","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/ephesians-4-ministries/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/ephesians-4-ministries/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Ephesians 4 Ministries  So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.","tags":null,"title":"Ephesians 4 Ministries","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Faith Promises Lk 15:31 \u0026ldquo;Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.\u0026rdquo;\nJn 14:12-15 \u0026ldquo;He who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.

For biblical background and more on the vision behind Growth Groups see \u0026ldquo;Growth Groups - Introduction for Leaders\u0026rdquo;.\nLove One another \u0026ndash; go and make disciples Jesus gave many commandments but there is one He gave special emphasis to. He called it a New Commandment. It was short and simple:\n\u0026ldquo;Love one another\u0026rdquo; (John 13:34).\nThe last command Matthew records, known as the Great Commission is:\n\u0026ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 28:18-20)\nGrowth Groups are one of the simplest and most effective ways of fulfilling the New Commandment and the Great Commission.\nGrowth Group Principles Growth Groups are built upon five essential elements which Jesus says discipleship depends upon:\n  Living in Jesus' Light\n  Believing and Obeying Jesus\n  Personal Relationship with Jesus\n  Feeding on Jesus\n  Hearing Jesus Speak\n  Living in Jesus' Light A disciple of Jesus is shaped and moulded by the radiant and penetrating purity and righteousness of God.\n \u0026ldquo;He who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 3:21)\n Those who have not discovered God\u0026rsquo;s truth in Jesus are afraid of the light. They fear God\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;interference\u0026rdquo; in their life; they fear the exposure of their ungodly deeds; they fear condemnation of their attitudes and motivations. On the other hand, those who know Jesus love the light. They love His truth; they are confident in His love; they rest in His forgiveness; they relish His affirmation as beloved children of God.\nLoving and living in God\u0026rsquo;s light is the starting point of discipleship. Growth Groups depend upon openness with one another and openness to God.\nBelieving and Obeying Jesus One of the clearest statements Jesus makes about discipleship is that to be a disciple we must both believe what He says and do what He commands; there is no discipleship without obedience.\n \u0026ldquo;Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 14:23)\n We must grow in our obedience to His moral teaching, but He also wants us to grow in confidence in His promises, especially to do the works that He did:\n \u0026ldquo;Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 14:12)\n Jesus says that faith and obedience are the true measure of our love for Him. Growth Groups therefore place faith and obedience to Jesus at their heart.\nPersonal Relationship Just as there is no discipleship without obedience, there can be no true obedience without a personal loving relationship with Jesus. Obedience flows from relationship, not knowledge:\n \u0026ldquo;Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 14:23)\n Many people admire Jesus from afar. We can admire and seek to imitate His example of love, we can be impressed by His insight into man\u0026rsquo;s nature, we can enjoy reading the Gospels. We might even be a faithful member of a church and devote our energies to loving others through acts of kindness. But discipleship is a call to a relationship with Jesus which bears the fruit of intimacy:\n \u0026ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. If you abide in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit ... showing yourselves to be my disciples.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 15:5,8)\n Focusing on intimacy and fruitfulness will be especially challenging as we all fall so short of the relationship that Jesus models for us. Nevertheless growth in our personal relationship with Jesus must be placed at the heart of our Growth Group.\nFeeding on Jesus Bible study and bible knowledge is commonly mistaken for discipleship, but Jesus was clear that they are not the same:\n \u0026ldquo;You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 5:39-40)\n This brings us back to personal relationship. Without personal relationship with Jesus all the study and knowledge in the world counts for nothing. But neither can there be discipleship without bible study:\n \u0026ldquo;If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 8:31)\n Jesus calls us beyond bible study. He says we are to abide in His word. The NIV has \u0026ldquo;remain\u0026rdquo; instead of abide (NKJV). I think abide conveys the sense better; it is where our home is, where we live, where we draw life from. The way Jesus explains what He means by abiding in His word is with the imagery of food. He says we are to feed on Him:\n \u0026ldquo;Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you ... For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in them. (Jn 6:53-56)\n When we read and study the scriptures, we should do so to feast on Jesus. We should think of it as eating a meal, not as gaining knowledge.\nImagine inviting some friends for a meal, but instead of eating the food, you simply discuss it. Perhaps you analyse its nutritional value and discuss where and how it was grown. You might sample the various foods and compare their tastes. You might come away much more knowledgeable about the food and even recommend it to others. But you have entirely missed the point.\nOn the other hand, what if you eat the meal? You might not be conscious of the need your body has for Iron and Magnesium and Vitamin B12. You might have no idea what happens to the food and how it helps your body to grow and stay healthy. But eating it will still do you good!\nThis is how we should approach the Word of God, both in our personal reading and in our Growth Group. Discussion of origins and meanings and possible applications may well enhance our enjoyment of the meal, but even where we have little understanding of the meaning and no knowledge of how it can help us, it still does us good. God\u0026rsquo;s word, and especially the Gospels, is food for the Holy Spirit to use in shaping our thinking and nourishing our faith. If you do not yet know this to be true, you will soon prove it for yourself as you share in your Growth Group.\nLearning to feed on Jesus is central to discipleship.\nHearing Jesus Speak You might be surprised that prayer has not been included as one of the essential ingredients of discipleship. Well, it has been, except that the aspect of prayer Jesus tied to discipleship is not us speaking to God (which even unbelievers do), but God speaking to us. Jesus said:\n \u0026ldquo;My sheep hear My voice\u0026rdquo; (John 10:27).\n Nearly every chapter of John\u0026rsquo;s Gospel shows us that Jesus heard the Father\u0026rsquo;s voice and received His direction for life and ministry from Him. Jesus teaches that hearing God is a mark of discipleship:\n \u0026ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.\u0026rdquo; (John 6:63)\n\u0026ldquo;He who is of God hears God\u0026rsquo;s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.\u0026rdquo; (John 8:47)\n One of the primary characteristics of the New Covenant is the giving of the Holy Spirit so that we may be taught directly by Him:\n \u0026ldquo;It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Holy Spirit will not come to you; ... He will guide you into all the truth ... He will glorify me because he will receive from me and make it known to you.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 16:7-14)\n Listening to God is one of the most important aspects of prayer for a disciple. Yet some people find even the idea of hearing Jesus difficult. This is an area where we must exercise our faith and believe what Jesus says, \u0026ldquo;My sheep hear My voice.\u0026rdquo; If you are a disciple and have been baptised in His Holy Spirit then you hear His voice \u0026ndash; but you might not have learnt to recognise it yet. God sometimes speaks to us very strongly and clearly, but often He speaks to us in a still, small voice and sometimes we only discern His voice gradually over a period of weeks or months. He often uses a combination of methods including scripture, our own thoughts and conversations with others.\nGrowth Groups are designed to help you grow in confidence in discerning what Jesus is saying to you.\nGrowth Group Practice Jesus made two great promises which are the foundation of the Growth Group method.\n  Where two or three gather in my name, I am there with them (Matthew 18:20)\n  The Spirit of truth will guide you into all the truth. (John 16:13)\n  Two or three friends, meeting together in confident faith that Jesus is with them and the Holy Spirit will guide them, can join the growing family of countless other such groups who experience the joy and excitement of being discipled by Jesus.\nA Growth Group is a group of two or three people who meet regularly to be discipled by Jesus. Only one of the members needs to be a Christian, the others may be Christians or not-yet-Christians who are curious about Jesus.\nThe group meets once a week to learn from Jesus, love each other and share in an adventure of faith. Through prayer, discussing and applying scripture and through outreach the group will grow both in discipleship and in numbers. To function well the members must be open and real with one another, let the Holy Spirit teach them and be prepared to take risks and learn from their mistakes.\nGrowth Group Distinctives A Growth Group is NOT just another name for a cell group, home group, bible study group or prayer partner / triplet. The essential distinctives of a Growth Group are these:\n  No more than three members    Growth Groups are limited to two or three members. Four is recommended only for a short period before dividing into two groups. The reason is that where there are four or more people, some can easily become spectators.\n   Each Growth Group goes at its own pace    Each group is unique and should be free to choose what scripture they read and at what pace they proceed through a book.\n   It does not require a leader    Growth Groups depend upon the Holy Spirit to be the leader and teacher. Growth Groups work well even with brand new Christians who have no one to teach them.\n   It is not a prayer group    Growth Groups pray, but prayer is not the focus; discipleship is. A prayer group\u0026rsquo;s purpose has been fulfilled when you have prayed together. A Growth Group\u0026rsquo;s purpose is fulfilled only by growing obedience to Jesus.\n   It is not a bible study    Growth Groups study the bible, but bible knowledge and understanding is not the focus; discipleship is.\nA bible study asks \u0026ldquo;What does this passage mean\u0026rdquo; and usually requires someone to lead and do some teaching, or books or study guides to help.\nA Growth Group asks \u0026ldquo;What is Jesus saying to me today.\u0026rdquo; Growth Groups can benefit from bible study helps, but they are not dependent upon them. The Holy Spirit will give understanding sufficient for the obedience He is asking for.\n   Every day, not just once a week    Although the Growth Group will usually meet just once a week, it is dependent upon each member having daily time with Jesus asking Him to speak to them through that week\u0026rsquo;s bible passage. It is also dependent upon daily prayer and obedience to the Holy Spirit.\n   Growth Groups change    Most other groups' value stability and the members often stay together for years. This is not the case with Growth Groups. The membership of a healthy Growth Group will change as it reaches out to include new people and then divides to observe the \u0026ldquo;no more than three\u0026rdquo; rule.\n   Growth Groups are allowed to fail    It is important that all members of a Growth Group know that it is perfectly alright to stop. Indeed if you do not feel it is helping you grow in obedience to Jesus then you should stop. It is better to seek new partners for a group than to continue with a group that is not growing. But you should not give up too soon. If you have not been in a Growth Group before it may take up to 6 months before you really begin to recognise how Jesus is teaching you and causing you to grow.\nJesus warned us that some people are poor soil; some will not want to continue as a disciple of Jesus. Sadly we have to let them go rather than have them hold others back. Growth groups are not suitable for half-hearted Christians.\n Learning to Listening Members of a Growth Group must practice listening to one another and listening to Jesus. Sharing about our most intimate relationship is often difficult and can make us feel vulnerable. It is vital that we listen carefully to each other. These guidelines will help:\n  Each member should be allowed to share without being interrupted.\n  We should not try to provide answers to one another\u0026rsquo;s problems; when a person shares their heart, they want you to listen to them, not fix them.\n  Questions may be asked to help a person explore and express their meaning.\n  Offer help only if invited to do so.\n  After this, ordinary interactive discussion can follow.\n  A Growth Group is not a competition for the deepest insights; it is sitting together at Jesus' feet. It is perfectly alright to say, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t understand this passage\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know what Jesus might be saying to me\u0026rdquo;. As we feed on Jesus and share the delights we are enjoying with each other, we need to practice listening for Jesus' voice. The most important thing is that we encourage each other to keep listening to Jesus in the confident assurance that His sheep hear His voice.\nLearning to Obey Jesus Jesus told us to make disciples who obey all He commanded. This is the focus of Growth Groups from day one, even if some members are not yet saved.\nEach day of the week you read an agreed portion of scripture on your own (or with a friend if your reading is poor). Remember to approach this like eating a meal. Whether or not you feel you are learning anything, trust the Holy Spirit to make it spiritual food and drink to you.\nThen once a week you meet to discuss the passage and ask Jesus to show you what He is saying to you and what He wants you to do about it. You may find it helpful for each of you to answer four simple questions:\n  What does this passage tell us about people?\n  What does this passage tell us about Jesus or God?\n  What does Jesus want to say to me personally?\n  Who does Jesus want me to share this message with?\n  What to read  If you have not-yet-Christians or new Christians in the group we recommend you start your daily readings with the Seven Signs of Jesus (see later).  \u0026lt;!-- --\u0026gt;\r  When you have completed this we recommend you work through Luke\u0026rsquo;s gospel.  From here there are a variety of options depending on the needs and abilities of the group.\n  You could stay in the gospels, working through each in turn. I have found this extremely profitable.\n  You could venture into Acts which is more like a fifth gospel than any other part of scripture.\n  \u0026lt;!-- --\u0026gt;\r   Venturing further into the New Testament the shorter letters are easier to understand than the longer ones.\n  The New Testament often refers to the Old Testament. At some point you will probably want to follow the story of salvation through the Old Testament. You can stick to the main stories and skip over the rest or perhaps intersperse OT books with NT books.\n  How much to read My advice is to go at your own pace. The members must agree week by week the minimum portion of scripture they will read the following week, but then each member is free to concentrate on just one verse or to read several chapters around the agreed passage. Each must follow what they feel the Holy Spirit is leading them to.\nOnce a person has learnt to hear Jesus and obey Him from the Gospels, you should consider reading much larger portions of scripture - up to 20-30 chapters a week. This ensures that scripture is read in its context, in its entirety and repeatedly. So for example Romans (16 chapters) might be read once or perhaps twice in a week, but Ephesians (6 chapters) might be read three to five times.\nAccountability to One another Friends who love another will speak up if they think their friend is doing something wrong or is disregarding what Jesus is saying. But friends who love each other will do this with love and gentleness, seeking to win their friend, not to condemn them:\n \u0026ldquo;Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted. Carry each other\u0026rsquo;s burdens, and in this way you will fulfil the law of Christ.\u0026rdquo; (Gal 6:1-2)\n If a friend feels that God is disciplining them, you will be careful and prayerful in offering comfort, protecting your friend from the deceitful and destructive lies of Satan but letting the Holy Spirit do his heart surgery.\nGod holds each of us accountable for how we live our lives and one day we will have to give an account to Him. But if you recognise that you are being tempted in an area of weakness and vulnerability you would be very wise to share this with your Growth Group, or perhaps another friend who really cares about you.\nSome groups are excessive or even obsessive about accountability, in the misguided belief that confessing every known sin each week to one another will help stop us sinning. I believe this practice is harmful rather than helpful. It leads to self-righteousness and pride and actually encourages people to hide their sin rather than share their struggles.\nSo take care:\n  Let there be humility, love and mercy.\n  Focus on the heart rather than outward behaviour.\n  Aim to please Christ, not just have a clean track record.\n  No pretence of holiness or wallowing in failure.\n  Move towards genuine repentance, not just confession.\n  Find peace and acceptance not in our behaviour, but in His grace and that Christ is our righteousness.\n  The following questions are designed to help you think if there is anything you wish to share for prayer and encouragement.\nAccountability Questions   Are you enjoying a consistent prayer life and listening to God?\n  Have you sought first God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom this week?\n  Have you struggled with any disappointments this week?\n  Have you been self-conscious, self-pitying, or self-justifying?\n  Have you given sufficient time to communicating with your spouse / close friends? Is there harmony?\n  Have you been consistent in talking to, training and disciplining your children / dependents / people you are discipling?\n  Are you reconciled to everyone as far as it depends on you?\n  Are there any people or situations you are trying to avoid or control? Have you been prideful, boastful or gossiped?\n  Have you handled your work and money in a godly, honest, faithful and generous manor?\n  Are you preoccupied with unhelpful thoughts or struggling with addictive or compulsive behaviour?\n  Have you cared for your body in your diet, exercise, recreation and sleep? Have you been excessive in TV or games?\n  Has media or peer pressure influenced you wrongly?\n  Have you demonstrated a servant\u0026rsquo;s heart? Not lording it over another? Have you been angry or lacked mercy or compassion?\n  Are you resting in Christ and not obsessing in your failures, dwelling on disappointments or trusting in your own performance?\n  What would you like help with this week?\n  Prayer Having discussed your scripture reading and shared what you think Jesus is saying to you, it is time to pray. Start with a time of thanksgiving and then pray for one another and for any other issues that concern members of the group and finally for those you are seeking to reach in mission. Each member should try to name at least one not-yet-believer they are specifically praying for.\nPray with confident faith, fully expecting God to answer your prayers. Remember Luke 12:32 \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;it is the Father\u0026rsquo;s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.\u0026rdquo;\nMission Try to arrange to share in mission together each week. Jesus gave very clear instructions for outreach:\n \u0026ldquo;But whatever house you enter, first say, \u0026lsquo;Peace to this house.\u0026rsquo; And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on it; if not, it will return to you. And remain in the same house, eating and drinking such things as they give, for the labourer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house \u0026hellip; Heal the sick who are there and tell them, \u0026lsquo;The kingdom of God is near you.\u0026rsquo; But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, \u0026lsquo;Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.'\u0026rdquo; (Lk 10:5-11)\n You could start by simply visiting and praying blessing and healing for your immediate neighbours. If you can\u0026rsquo;t visit people in their houses, look for a place where people know one another, such as a club or popular café or local bar. Expect the Holy Spirit to lead you to good soil, a \u0026ldquo;son of peace\u0026rdquo;, where He has been preparing the ground to receive the word.\nSome important points arise from this scripture:\n  Go out to people\u0026rsquo;s houses and families with the gospel. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect them to come to your church.\n  Bring gospel peace and healing to a whole family, not just the individual you meet first.\n  Get the family to invite their friends to share in their discovery; don\u0026rsquo;t you go house to house.\n  If a person turns out to be poor soil we should encourage and challenge them with the Gospel but if they do not chose to follow Jesus faithfully, then don\u0026rsquo;t waste time on them. Look for better soil.\n  When you find someone who wants to hear more about Jesus, offer to come to their house each week and share with their whole family and any friends or neighbours they would like to invite. Give them the Seven Signs of Jesus (signs 1-3) asking them to read the first sign every day during the week. When you visit the following week let each person answer the first question. Then let each person answer the second question. Then the third and finally the fourth. Urge them to respond in obedience to the third question, \u0026ldquo;What does this scripture say about you?\u0026rdquo; and also to act on their answer to the last question:\n \u0026ldquo;Who needs to hear this?\u0026rdquo;\n Remember that from day one you are seeking to teach them to be obedient to Jesus and to engage in mission.\nExperience shows that anyone who completes the seven weeks will almost certainly want to follow Jesus. At this point you will need to rearrange your Growth Group because each new person who wishes to follow Jesus will need to be in a Growth Group. Your group may need to disband so each of you can lead a new group allowing you to add up to six new people to the church!\nStarting a Growth Group - The First Meeting The Seven Signs of Jesus is a key tool for mission so each member needs to be familiar with this study. If the members of a Growth Group have not already done this study you should start with the Seven Signs of Jesus as your weekly scripture reading.\n  Make sure you each have a modern translation of the bible\nor a copy of the Seven Signs of Jesus (signs 1-3)\n  Go through this leaflet and make sure each one understands the purpose of the Growth Group.\n  Take turns for each member to say how they feel they can show love and care for one another.\n  In the same way, share in turn about each of the following:\na. Finding a time when you can meet for 1½ hours each week.\nb. Being open and honest with each other.\nc. Being obedient to scripture.\nd. Reaching out to your neighbours, friends and community.\n  Pray for one another.\n  Agree on your next meeting time and the scripture you will read during the week.\n  Multiplying Growth Groups Through mission a group will soon add another member to the group. The group is allowed to meet for two weeks with four members so that the newest members can see how the group works, and then the group should multiply into two Growth Groups. Each group can then continue to add two new members before multiplying again. Growth Groups of more than three members are nowhere near as effective as groups of two or three and should be strongly discouraged. Larger groups can function as Discovery Groups, or several Growth Groups can meet together as a church (see separate handbooks).\nDemonstrating the Gospel - Seven Signs of Jesus For decades the church has used tracts with a summary of the \u0026ldquo;gospel\u0026rdquo; for evangelism. These typically talk about the problem of our sin, the solution in the cross and a \u0026ldquo;sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer\u0026rdquo;. However, the Gospel is never presented like this in the Holy-Spirit inspired scriptures.\nWhen we start reaching out to people held in the grip of Satan\u0026rsquo;s lies we soon see the wisdom of Jesus\u0026rsquo; approach. He never explained how He had come to take the penalty for our sin; rather He broke the power of Satan. He demonstrated the Gospel\u0026rsquo;s power rather than explaining its theory. He set people free from sickness and demonic oppression.\nConsider how the Holy Spirit inspired John\u0026rsquo;s Gospel:\n\u0026ldquo;Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.\u0026rdquo; (John 20:30-31)\nThese verses describe precisely what we are trying to achieve with our little tracts. The reality is that unsaved people are not interested in the theory of salvation; they need to see and hear stories of salvation. That is why a newly transformed believer telling his story makes a good evangelist - we should listen and learn from them.

Only one of the members needs to be a Christian, the others may be anyone who is curious about Jesus.\nTwo Commands Growth Groups are the most effective way of obeying Jesus' two great commands:\n \u0026ldquo;Love one another\u0026rdquo; (John 13:34) and\n\u0026quot;Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you.\u0026quot; (Matthew 28:19-20)\n Two Promises Growth Groups depend on two promises Jesus made. This means that as we read scripture together we can trust the Holy Spirit to lead us to Jesus:\n \u0026quot;Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.\u0026quot; (Matthew 18:20) and\n\u0026quot;The Spirit of truth will guide you into all the truth.\u0026quot; (John 16:13)\n Two Warnings Going to church does not mean we are disciples. We can even do bible study and still not be disciples. We must be obedient to Jesus and come to know Jesus Himself, not just know the scriptures:\n \u0026quot;Not everyone who says to me, \u0026lsquo;Lord, Lord,\u0026rsquo; will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\u0026quot; (Matthew 7:21)\n\u0026ldquo;You study the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life ... yet you refuse to come to me to have life.\u0026rdquo; (John 5:39-40)\n Two Relationships We are called into two types of relationship. Firstly our relationship with the Father; which is through knowing Jesus with the help of the Holy Spirit. That is why we must learn to listen to Jesus and not just study the Bible.\nSecondly we are called to love one another. So we must learn to listen to one another in the Growth Group, and pray for one another, and love one another.\nFour Questions When the Growth Group meets, you start by reading aloud the passage you have chosen. Each person should then repeat the passage in their own words to make sure everyone understands what they have read. Then each person should share in discussing these four questions:\n  What does this passage tell us about people?\n  What does this passage tell us about Jesus or God?\n  What does Jesus want to say to me personally?\n  Who does Jesus want me to share this message with?\n  People often need help to learn how to answer the first two questions. They are NOT about what the passage is saying to us as Christians (that is the third question). The first question is to help us think about the people Jesus wants us to share the Good News with. What are they like? What are their needs or fears? How are they deceived by Satan? Most passages tell us something about what people are like.\nThe second question is to help us think about God's nature; His love, holiness, glory, mercy etc. Most passages tell us something about God.\nThe third and fourth question should be personal; not \u0026quot;What does this passage tell people they should do?\u0026quot; but \u0026quot;What specific thing in my life right now is Jesus speaking to me about?\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Which specific friend or neighbour does Jesus want me to speak to about this passage?\u0026quot;\nThen take turns to pray for each one in the group, and for your outreach.\nChoosing a Passage Your Pastor may recommend some particular passages for you to read to help you get started with your Growth Group. You should start with short passages or even single verses. Once you are used to studying the scriptures in your Growth Group we recommend you work your way through Luke's Gospel and then the other Gospels before moving on to the rest of the bible.\nGo at the pace that suits your group. Do not wear people out with difficult passages or long meetings. You do not need to understand everything, just leave out passages you find difficult.\nStarting New Groups Family groups are a great way to start. You might start meeting as a whole family, but should soon divide into threes (plus any small children). You can invite someone else to see how your group works, or offer to help them start their own group, and meet with them for a few weeks to get them started.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b3b71531e28030653680e793321bbcd7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/growth-groups/growth-groups-a-simple-guide/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/growth-groups/growth-groups-a-simple-guide/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Growth Groups - A Simple Guide Motto: Love one another \u0026ndash; Go and make disciples\nA Growth Group is two or three people who meet regularly (usually once or twice a week) to be discipled by Jesus.","tags":null,"title":"Growth Groups - A Simple Guide","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Growth\nGroups\nAn Introduction for Leaders\n Stephen Dolley\nJanuary 2014\nMaterial drawn from:\nOrganic Church : Neil Cole\nChurch 3.0 : Neil Cole\n\nContents\nHis Presence 3\nJesus' Commission 3\nDo what I have commanded you 3\nStarting small 4\nWhat?

Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 28:18-20)\nChurch is ministry BY Jesus, not ministry FOR Jesus and should be measured not by our attendance but His presence.\nBy faith we know His presence, and by acting on that faith we see the results of His presence. This should be at the heart of what it means for us to be and do church. God dwelling with His people; Christ acting through His Body.\nJesus' Commission Do what I have commanded you The Great Commission must be among the scriptures best known by Christians:\n\u0026ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 28:18-20)\nThere is a very important thing to notice about this commission. Jesus did not say \u0026ldquo;teach them all I taught you\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;teach them all about me\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;teach them the bible.\u0026rdquo; He said \u0026ldquo;teach them to obey me.\u0026rdquo; This puts a rather different emphasis on things. Certainly we want to learn about God and for people to think deeply and intelligently about God. We therefore value teaching about God. But the emphasis of Jesus commission is not teaching knowledge, but teaching obedience to Jesus.\nTeaching obedience to Jesus is not the same as teaching the stories and parables of Jesus. It is not the same as teaching the doctrines of salvation and grace and resurrection. It is not the same as preaching the gospel and leading people to Christ. All these things are good, but they are not the great commission. There is only one way to fulfil the great commission and that is to teach people to obey Jesus.\nPeople need to be taught how to obey Jesus. It does not come naturally. They need to be taught how to read the bible, especially the gospels, how to listen to Jesus speaking to them through the Holy Spirit, how to believe and trust Him and how to do what He says to do.\nDiscipleship is like car mechanics; a group of apprentices pouring over the manual, discussing what it means and how to do it, then going out and having a go.\nStarting small Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;Where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them\u0026rdquo; (Matt 18:20).\nThe basic unit of church is twos and threes encouraging one another in obedience to Jesus. That is a good place to start. If we cannot discover the presence and will of Jesus in groups of two or three, then we cannot expect to do so with a larger group. If we can\u0026rsquo;t multiply groups of 2 or 3 we will never multiply the church.2\nDiscipleship is an adventure of faith. It requires people to be open and real with one another and to be prepared to take risks and make mistakes. Disciple making is a time consuming business requiring deep relationships.\nWhat? No bible teacher? We must not think that every small group needs a skilled and trained leader. Three brand new believers can read the scriptures together, learn from the Holy Spirit and see God answer their prayers.\nWe must not hold people back because they have not been trained. We must not teach people to be dependent on us to understand the word. They must know they can feed themselves. They must know that Jesus Himself has commissioned them and sends them with His authority to do His work. They must know they can depend upon the Holy Spirit and the scriptures to be their teacher.\nOur job as teachers is not to give messages about the word, but to demonstrate our conviction that Jesus Himself has the words of life.\n\u0026ldquo;For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.\u0026rdquo; (Heb 4:12)\nCan you do that? Do we think we can improve on it? Trust the Holy Spirit to apply His word to a person\u0026rsquo;s life.3\nFront-line Action from the Start Jesus chose uneducated fishermen to be His disciples and sent them out on mission immediately. They were not trained in bible study and leadership. They didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to preach or lead prayer meetings. Nevertheless, Jesus sent them:\nSo Jesus said to them again, \u0026ldquo;Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.\u0026rdquo; (John 20:21)\n\u0026ldquo;Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 10:16)\nNew believers must learn to trust God right away so, like Jesus, we send new believers on mission immediately.4 But they must know that it is not us who are sending them but Jesus, and they go with His authority:\n\u0026ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 28:18-20)\nThe mission we are sent on is also clear; to do what Jesus did:\nThen He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. (Lk 9:1-2)\nSuch must be our expectation from the very start of a believer\u0026rsquo;s new life in Christ. We must teach faith-filled obedience from day 1. \u0026ldquo;See one, do one, teach one.\u0026rdquo; A new believer only needs to observe ministry once before he/she should be having a go themselves. Having ministered once, they can begin to pass on what they have learnt immediately.\nGoing in His Name The essence of discipleship, and therefore fulfilling the great commission, is incredibly simple; groups of two or three believers experiencing the presence of Jesus and ministering Gospel truth and healing in His authority to unbelievers.\nSo how and where are you going to start your group of two or three? Jesus gives us clear and simple instructions:\n\u0026ldquo;Now whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there till you go out.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 10:11)\nWe start by going to a place and asking people \u0026ldquo;who needs to hear the gospel?\u0026rdquo; We are likely to be directed to poor desperate souls whose lives are in tatters. Then we do what Jesus said to do:\n\u0026ldquo;As you go, preach, saying, \u0026lsquo;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u0026rsquo; Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 10:7-8)\nWe minister healing and deliverance to those in need, and we start a Bible Discovery Group in the new believers home, not ours (Matt 10:11 above). That will ensure the gospel reaches the whole family, not just an individual.\nThen, again following Jesus' example, we baptize new believers immediately and publicly and let them baptise their converts:\nTherefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples), He left Judea and departed again to Galilee. (Jn 4:1-3)\nSo how do we start? We start in the harvest and start small with 2 or 3.\nThe Seed and the Soils Jesus gave instruction about our mission both directly and through parables. The parable of the soils is very instructive:\n\u0026ldquo;Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow. And it happened, as he sowed, that some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds of the air came and devoured it. Some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth. But when the sun was up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away. And some seed fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no crop. But other seed fell on good ground and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.\u0026rdquo; And He said to them, \u0026ldquo;He who has ears to hear, let him hear!\u0026rdquo; But when He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable. And He said to them, \u0026ldquo;To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things come in parables, so that \u0026lsquo;Seeing they may see and not perceive, And hearing they may hear and not understand; Lest they should turn, And their sins be forgiven them.'\u0026rdquo; And He said to them, \u0026ldquo;Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables? The sower sows the word\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (Mr 4:3-14)\nSome important lessons here are:\n  You need good seed \u0026ndash; the Word of God.\n  You need good soil to grow a church.\n  You cannot be sure which soil is good.\n  Three quarters of the seed will prove fruitless.\n  Two thirds of the growth will prove fruitless.\n  If we have ears to hear and accept these basic truths about sowing the word, we will save a great deal of heart-ache over trying to make fruitless situations bear fruit. Concentrate on the fruit-bearing soil and don\u0026rsquo;t waste time on the rest.\n\u0026ldquo;But whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say, \u0026lsquo;The very dust of your city which clings to us we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near you.\u0026rsquo; But I say to you that it will be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 10:10-12)\n\u0026ldquo;And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 10:38)\nLet the fruitful people be a provocation to the fruitless ones. Jesus did not lack compassion for fruitless people, but He still sent them away. According to Jesus\u0026rsquo; interpretation of this parable, fruitless people are fruitless because they have not given up on the world\u0026rsquo;s fruits. They want the world plus a bit of Jesus. Jesus said you cannot serve two masters and He told people so.\nFinding Good Soil Although we cannot be sure we have found good soil until we see its fruit, Jesus did tell us where to look:\n  bad people: \u0026ldquo;I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners,\n to repentance.\u0026rdquo; (Lu 5:32)\n   poor people: \u0026ldquo;God has chosen the poor of this world to be rich in\n faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?\u0026rdquo; (Jas 2:5)\n   child-like people: \u0026ldquo;unless you are converted and become as little\n children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 18:3)\n   \u0026lt;!-- --\u0026gt;\r   desperate people: \u0026ldquo;Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 7:7 NKJV)\n  despised people: \u0026ldquo;God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, that no flesh should glory in His presence.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 1:27-29)\n  The police know where the good soil is; ask them!\nAvoiding the bad soil   Self-made people: \u0026ldquo;not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 1:26)\n  Self-righteous people: \u0026ldquo;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.\u0026rdquo; (Lu 5:31-32)\n  Wealthy people: \u0026ldquo;How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u0026rdquo; (Lu 18:24-25)\n  Jesus did not exactly encourage half-hearted disciples, He sent them away! Jesus loved people by confronting them with their choices. He sent the rich young ruler, whom He loved, away. To do otherwise is cruel, selfish and counterproductive! 5\nNow as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him, and asked Him, \u0026ldquo;Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?\u0026rdquo; So Jesus said to him, \u0026ldquo;Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. \u0026ldquo;You know the commandments: \u0026lsquo;Do not commit adultery,\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Do not murder,\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Do not steal,\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Do not bear false witness,\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Do not defraud,\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Honour your father and your mother.'\u0026rdquo; And he answered and said to Him, \u0026ldquo;Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth.\u0026rdquo; Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, \u0026ldquo;One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.\u0026rdquo; But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. (Mk 10:17-20)\nGod\u0026rsquo;s prepared soil In addition to this general guidance about where to look for good soil, we can expect the Holy Spirit to lead us to good soil where He has been preparing the ground to receive the word.\n\u0026ldquo;He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their pre-appointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;\u0026rdquo; (Ac 17:26-27)\n\u0026ldquo;But whatever house you enter, first say, \u0026lsquo;Peace to this house.\u0026rsquo; And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on it; if not, it will return to you. And remain in the same house, eating and drinking such things as they give, for the labourer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 10:5-7)\nSome important points arise from these scriptures:\n  God has set the times and places for people to live so they might seek and find God: expect your family, neighbours, work colleagues and other acquaintances to have been placed in your circle by God so they might find Him.\n  Go into people\u0026rsquo;s houses and families with the gospel. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect them to come to your church.\n  Bring gospel peace and healing to a whole family, not just individuals.\n  If a family receives you, build a close friendship with them.\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t you go house to house; let the family do that, inviting their friends to share in their discovery.\n  If you can\u0026rsquo;t visit people in their houses, look for a place where people know one another, such as a club or popular café or local bar.6\nFrom Seed to Harvest We share the gospel (sow the seed), God transforms a person\u0026rsquo;s life (brings growth), that person becomes an obedient disciple (bears fruit) and they minister Christ to others (we reap a harvest). Our place in this process is to be a friend and an example, teaching a new believer how to depend on Christ and His word through the Holy Spirit.\nThe kingdom grows by multiplying healthy disciples.7 If a person turns out to be poor soil we should encourage and challenge them with the Gospel and make them chose whom they will follow. If they do not rise to the challenge and follow Jesus faithfully, then don\u0026rsquo;t waste time on them. Look for better soil.\nHow can you keep things on track? We must trust Jesus to be the head of His church and the Holy Spirit to lead and teach His children. To impose control over small groups and churches in order to ensure they conform to some pattern we have decided upon is to go beyond our remit as disciple makers.\nJesus was perfectly clear and un-phased that 3 out of 4 seeds may ultimately prove fruitless; that tares will grow up with the wheat; that false prophets will do mighty wonders without ever knowing Jesus; that talents will be given which are buried and that many will fall away. In the light of this we must trust Jesus with His church. Our attempts to protect what we have by hedging it about with rules only have the effect of stifling growth and development.\nWe should teach well, warn people who depart from the simplicity of the Gospel or who get ensnared by worldliness and pray for God\u0026rsquo;s intervention. But in the end we must let go. In our care for the church we should not end up babysitting poor soils, but give ourselves to working with the good soil.8\nA Pattern for Multiplication Jesus\u0026rsquo; commission for discipleship implies multiplying disciples which leads to multiplying leaders and multiplying churches. Paul was obedient to this, moving quickly from one place to another leaving a trail of young churches behind him. Part of Paul\u0026rsquo;s strategy was to maintain a simple pattern which he taught wherever he went:\nJoin with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you. (Phil 3:17)\nPaul does not give us his pattern in a simple form, but it can be discerned from his letters, and is perhaps summarised by his repeated themes of faith, hope and love:\n\u0026ldquo;And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 13:13)\n\u0026ldquo;remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father,\u0026rdquo; (1Th 1:3)\n\u0026ldquo;But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation.\u0026rdquo; (1Th 5:8)\nWorks of faith \u0026ndash; healing the sick and delivering people from the snares of the devil; labours of love \u0026ndash; loving one another as Jesus loves us; patience of hope \u0026ndash; living life out of our secure position in Christ. These are then DNA of our discipleship and should be in every aspect of our private and corporate church life.\nEvery disciple, every meeting, every ministry must have all the DNA at the same time9; works of faith, labours of love and patient hope in the sight of our God and Father.\nTwo other keys are seen here: firstly the leaders MUST set the example. If you are promoting Growth Groups for your people, it is essential that the leaders, including the pastor, are also in Growth Groups. Only those who experience the power of a Growth Group for themselves will be truly passionate about them. Secondly, you will discover new leaders as you \u0026ldquo;take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you\u0026rdquo;. Effective leaders will emerge from multiplying Growth Groups.\nEvangelism The missional life is: Make friends, Throw parties, Tell stories and Give gifts. Sounds both entirely possible and fun10\nDisciples should look for good soil in which to sow the seed of the word. But what should we sow? How should we present the gospel? For decades the church has used tracts with a summary of the \u0026ldquo;gospel\u0026rdquo; for evangelism. These typically talk about the problem of our sin, the solution in the cross and a \u0026ldquo;sinners prayer\u0026rdquo;. Do you not think it strange that this \u0026ldquo;gospel\u0026rdquo; is not presented in this form anywhere in scripture. It is even stranger that this \u0026ldquo;gospel\u0026rdquo; cannot be easily derived from the four Gospels. We do well to heed the Gospel which the Holy Spirit has already designed for us: John said:\nJesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. (Jn 20:30-31)\nThose verses describe precisely what we are trying to achieve with our little tracts. It is time we followed the inspired scriptures rather than trying to improve on them with our selected verses. The reality is that unsaved people are not interested in the means of our salvation which our tracts try to explain. They need to hear genuine good news. The signs which John records are a powerful way of sharing that good news.\nJohn selected seven miraculous signs:\n  Water into Wine (Jn 2:1-12)\n  Healing of official\u0026rsquo;s son (Jn 4:46-54)\n  Healing of paralytic at Pool of Bethesda (Jn 5:1-17)\n  Feeding of 5000 (Jn 6:1-14)\n  Walking on the water (Jn 6:15-25)\n  Healing of man born blind (Jn 9:1-41)\n  Raising of Lazarus (Jn 11:1-46)\n  A method which has been found very powerful is to get a seeker to take one story a week and read it every day. Each week meet them and ask:\n  []{#_Toc439784027 .anchor}What does this passage tell us about people?\n  What does this passage tell us about Jesus or God?\n  What does Jesus want to say to me personally?\n  Who does Jesus want me to share this message with?\n  Growth Groups The building block of the church is 2-3 disciples in intimate relationship. Across the world very small Growth Groups, Discipleship Groups, Life Transformation Groups \u0026ndash; call them what you like \u0026ndash; have proved to be the essential foundation of multiplying churches.\nWith 4 or more, it is very easy for a person to drift into the background, or for sub-groups to form. Groups of 2-3 are the ideal size for both accountability and mission:11\n\u0026ldquo;After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 10:1).\nWhile they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, \u0026ldquo;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.\u0026rdquo; So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off. (Acts 13:2-3).\nSee the Growth Group Handbook for details of starting and running Growth Groups.\n  Parts of this section quoted from Organic Church, P54 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n quoted from Organic Church, P99 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n quoted from Organic Church, P66 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n quoted from Organic Church, P132 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n quoted from Organic Church, P71 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n quoted from Organic Church, P177 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n quoted from Organic Church, P98 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n quoted from Organic Church, P69 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n quoted from Organic Church, P118 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n quoted from Church 3.0, P206 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n quoted from Church 3.0, P140 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f749edec6c21025766fffd44d279f0a5","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/growth-groups/growth-groups-introduction-for-leaders/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/growth-groups/growth-groups-introduction-for-leaders/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Growth\nGroups\nAn Introduction for Leaders\n Stephen Dolley\nJanuary 2014\nMaterial drawn from:\nOrganic Church : Neil Cole\nChurch 3.0 : Neil Cole\n\nContents\nHis Presence 3\nJesus' Commission 3","tags":null,"title":"Growth Groups - Introduction for Leaders","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"How Church Buildings Cripple the Gospel A story One day a group of people turned up in town. Some we knew, but most were strangers \u0026ndash; and there were some white people with them. They told us about Jesus and healed some who were sick. They travelled from house to house and then from village to village baptizing those who wanted to follow Jesus. We needed to learn more about this Jesus so they urged us to come to some meetings in town. To start with we met in a borrowed Lutheran church building.\nThese missionaries kept visiting us and soon they obtained land in the town and started to build a large sturdy meeting place of their own. It went up surprisingly quickly and they paid for all the materials and provided food for those who helped to build it. We assume that the white men were paying for this. Now we have somewhere dry and sheltered that we can all meet to pray and sing and hear teaching.\nBut we have a problem. We have been telling our neighbours in the villages beyond us about Jesus and want to start more churches. But we do not have the money to build church buildings, and we do not have the white men to help us. And now we want to start churches even further afield. But the people are even poorer than we are! We have asked the missionaries to build churches for us. They have been as generous as they can and given us some money from time to time, but it is not enough to build anything. We do not know what to do, so we are looking around to see if there are any other churches in the region that can help us.\nThis storey is imagined, but might easily be told by someone from a village near Ganglata.\nA different story Jesus was launching a region-wide campaign; there were no end of places that He wanted His disciples to reach out to. Any political campaigner would load up his emissaries with posters and tea-shirts and money - the best-resourced candidates make the biggest impact. But Jesus turns this on its head:\n As you go, proclaim this message: \u0026lsquo;The kingdom of heaven has come near.\u0026rsquo; Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy and drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. \u0026ldquo;Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts\u0026mdash; no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave (Matt 10:7-11). Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages (Luke 10:7)\n In Jesus' campaign He says to \u0026ldquo;give freely\u0026rdquo; and yet \u0026ldquo;take nothing with you\u0026rdquo;. This apparent paradox is really important: \u0026ldquo;Take nothing and give freely\u0026rdquo;.\nUnlimited Resources Now let\u0026rsquo;s compare these two stories. What does the \u0026ldquo;man-of-peace\u0026rdquo; experience in Jesus' day?\n  Two simply dressed people walked into my village carrying nothing with them.\n  They asked if they could stay a few days in my house.\n  \u0026lt;!-- --\u0026gt;\r   They brought healing, deliverance, baptism and transformed lives to our community.\n  They left to take their message to another village.\n  I have gone and done the same\u0026hellip;\n  What does our imagined friend in Ganglata experience?\n  A well-resourced missionary team, complete with their own cars, bringing their own food and even their own cooks.\n  They bring the gospel message with healing, deliverance, baptism and transformed lives.\n  A large well-funded church building goes up.\n  I do not have the resources to do this.\n  Can you see the problem? It is only natural that the events connected with hearing the Gospel remain associated in people\u0026rsquo;s minds. And those associations affect how they go about passing the Gospel on. If the Gospel gets associated with material resources it gets crippled. If it gets associated with white-men or with church-buildings, or with pastors or with denominations or with organisations \u0026ndash; all these associations cripple the Gospel.\nThe recipients of the Gospel must not associate human resources with the Gospel. Disciples are rich beyond measure with an endless supply of gifts to give away, but our supply is not dependent on human resources \u0026ndash; not our own nor anyone else\u0026rsquo;s.\nTo emphasis this point Jesus specifically instructs the disciples to depend upon those they minister to; to stay in their houses and eat their food. In human terms we are supposed to be dependent upon the willing generosity of those we minister to! Jesus is clear; in both Gospel accounts He reiterates this by saying \u0026ldquo;A labourer is worthy of his wages\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; meaning that those who receive the Gospel should provide for those who bring it.\nWhere does our help come from\u0026hellip; The instruction \u0026ldquo;Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts\u0026mdash; no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; was so important to Jesus because it goes to the heart of our trust in God. Do you remember the Psalmists cry \u0026ldquo;I lift up my eyes to the mountains - where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (Ps 121). Jesus is teaching them to rely on God for the resources to go on mission. We know this because Jesus refers back to this instruction much later in His ministry:\n Then Jesus asked them, \u0026ldquo;When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Nothing,\u0026rdquo; they answered (Luke 22:35).\n This is the issue Jesus is trying to impress upon His disciples when it comes to taking the Gospel to new places: \u0026ldquo;Was there anything you wish you had brought with you? Did you find yourselves saying \u0026lsquo;If only we had such-and-such our mission would have been so much more effective\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; did you lack anything? Were you hindered in your mission because you went empty-handed?\u0026rdquo;\nJesus wanted His disciples to learn from their experience so that they would know that the Gospel is good-news on its own. It should not be encumbered with gifts; and mission should not be encumbered with resource-heavy mission strategies.\nZero-cost church-planting The Gospel is too precious and too easily corrupted for us to risk ignoring Jesus' specific instructions. It is clearly not actual sticks and sandals and money bags that Jesus is concerned with, but what they represent. The propagation of the Gospel must not be associated with wealth. Zero-cost church-planting was Jesus' idea, and Jesus' command.\nThis model for evangelism and church-planting is totally biblical. It is Jesus' model and that followed by the apostles in the New Testament. They did not go with gifts for the poor and money to put up meeting-places. On the contrary, they stayed in other people\u0026rsquo;s homes, met in borrowed buildings and collected money to give to other communities that were facing famine. This is the biblical model.\nSadly, as with so many aspects of the Gospel, subsequent generations of Christians have departed from Jesus' model and done things their own way. It is \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; to want to avoid being a burden to any community we visit with the Gospel. It is \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; to want to take gifts of money, food and clothing to give away. It is \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; to want our own meeting place so that we can gather people for worship and teaching.\nAll these \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; aspects have their proper time and place \u0026ndash; but when we get them out of place, they can be harmful to the Gospel. It is vital that we listen to and learn from Jesus.\nThe Cart before the Horse Jesus says:\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t stay in a guest-house, stay in a villagers house.\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t spread the burden of your visit by staying each night in a different home.\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t pay for your own food \u0026ndash; eat what is offered to you.\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t take gifts to give away.\n  Paul was obedient to this when he travelled to a new place. Then, if he ended up staying for a significant period he rented a house and paid his own way so as not to burden the infant-church.\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s churches met in synagogues, temple courts, market-places \u0026ndash; wherever they could find room. They also met in people\u0026rsquo;s homes and courtyards. Putting a building up for a new church to meet in is not something we ever read of in the New Testament. It is putting the cart before the horse. A building must not be seen as facilitating a church. If people start to think they need a building in order to have a church then you cripple the Gospel.\nIf a mission into a new area puts up their own building too soon they risk damaging the Gospel. Here are just some of the issues that can arise in people\u0026rsquo;s minds:\n  I need to be able to gather people together to tell them how to follow Jesus.\n  I cannot start a new church in a neighbouring village because we do not have a building and cannot afford to build one..\n  Church buildings are a higher priority on limited resources than feeding the poor or children\u0026rsquo;s health or education.\n  I need to appear successful if people are going to take my message seriously.\n  Churches start with people, not buildings. Churches grow with people, not buildings. Churches fulfil the Great Commission with people, not buildings.\nBecause of tradition, people assume that a church needs its own building. But this way of thinking needs to be corrected. Israel wanted a king so that they would be like all the other nations \u0026ndash; but that was against God\u0026rsquo;s will and command for the nation. Being like everyone else is not what the Church is called to!\nA Meeting Place Churches have become associated with church buildings and this association has brought many problems. The message of evangelism has become \u0026quot;Go to church...\u0026quot; instead of bringing healing and deliverance into people's homes. Discipleship has become \u0026quot;Go to church\u0026quot; instead of listening to and obeying Jesus in our homes. Church-planting has become a matter of erecting buildings instead of planting groups of disciples. Church buildings are used to provide churches with a sense of identity and prestige \u0026ndash; \u0026quot;No one will take your church seriously if you don't have your own building...\u0026quot;.\nJesus said we should be a light set on a hill, not hidden away. When looking for a place to gather believers for worship, fellowship, shared meals and teaching, we look first for public buildings where believers are easily seen by the community and where non-members can easily come and see what is happening. The first choice would be a palaver hut or market area or some other open and public place. Perhaps a clinic or school may be usable, or a house with a large porch. If no such place is available we recommend approaching the community leaders and proposing that the community erect a suitable meeting place which the church can share.\nA church based on Growth Groups can grow and multiply and church plant without ever having its own building. Buildings must be seen as a luxury for communities that can well afford them rather than as a necessity for mission.\nFood for thought The Tower of Babel is instructive concerning the use of a building to provide a sense of belonging for churches:\n Now the whole world had one language and a common speech ... Then they said, \u0026ldquo;Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo; (Genesis 11:1,4)\n The people were united with a common language and culture, but became concerned that they might become scattered. This is very similar to the situation of a small community of believers in a town, or across a few neighbouring villages. They are united in Jesus; they \u0026quot;have one language\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; the Gospel. But they may desire a more tangible mark of identity to try to keep them together. This is a natural human desire - it is what creates communities.\nBut the story of Babel tells us that this desire to build a city (or a church meeting place) may come from a fear that without the building people will drift away; they will become scattered. The building provides a sense of belonging, identity and significance (\u0026quot;to make a name for ourselves\u0026quot;). But God was not pleased with this plan and He put a stop to it:\n But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, \u0026ldquo;If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.\u0026rdquo; So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. (Genesis 11:5-8)\n This tells us that when people get together and agree on some project they can make it happen \u0026ndash; even if it is not God's will! These people should not have been trying to make a name for themselves, but rather they should have been worshipping God and depending on Him.\nBefore we start erecting a church building we need to be sure that this is God's will, and not just our own response to the fear that without a building people will not take us seriously.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"db9df4ad66d2ad874fca685d0f2c3ad8","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/how-church-buildings-cripple-the-gospel/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/how-church-buildings-cripple-the-gospel/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"How Church Buildings Cripple the Gospel A story One day a group of people turned up in town. Some we knew, but most were strangers \u0026ndash; and there were some white people with them.","tags":null,"title":"How Church Buildings Cripple the Gospel","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Kingdom of God Jesus' teaching about the Kingdom has had a profound effect on my life in recent years. Not just on my understanding, but on my faith and my practice and my experience of God. Four years ago I had great difficulty knowing what to do with the many outrageous promises of Jesus about answered prayer and healing. I was a Christian agnostic. I firmly believed all that a good evangelical charismatic Christian believes, but in practice didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to believe much of what Jesus said. For example, \u0026ldquo;As the Father sent me so I send you.\u0026rdquo; This is innocuous enough if you think Jesus came to be nice to people and teach them good morals, but that is not what my bible says. My bible says \u0026ldquo;Jesus went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil.\u0026rdquo; I read that Jesus sent out 72 with power to heal and authority over demons. I read that Jesus healed all who came to him who were sick.\nI used to think that Jesus did all that healing to prove he was the Messiah, but four years ago as I was reading the Gospels again I realised that healing and deliverance was not about who Jesus is but about what the kingdom is. It was the core and essence of Jesus' Gospel. \u0026ldquo;If I cast out demons by the finger of God then the kingdom of God has come amongst you.\u0026rdquo; I was persuaded by my reading of the Gospels that healing and deliverance is meant to be the foundation of our proclamation and demonstration of the Gospel.\nAt that moment God did something in my heart. I became a believer. Instead of struggling with so many of the promises I decided I had better believe them. I had a wonderful joyous release of faith. What Paul wrote to the Romans happened to me. \u0026ldquo;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing.\u0026rdquo; The first thing that happened was that I was filled with the absolute and joyous conviction that I would wake up the next morning with my life long tinnitus gone. When I woke, guess what! I still had my tinnitus. What was I to do with my so-called newly found faith? What are we to do with these outrageous promises - especially when we give it a go and fail? Well I went round to an elderly friend who I had just heard had a very painful and inoperable problem with the vertebrae in her neck. I laid hands on her and prayed and she was instantly healed and remains free of this condition today.\nThat experience has helped me to keep trying regardless of previous failures. Jesus told many parables to encourage us to keep taking risks of faith. A king went on a long journey and before He left have his property to three of his trusted servants. On his eventual return two had gone out and taken risks with that property and made a profit, but one was fearful of failure and did nothing with it. Jesus made it very clear that he is not pleased if we shrink back in fear of failure rather than step out in faith on his promises. On the other hand he gave us many encouragements to persevere in faith. \u0026ldquo;Ask and you will receive\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Whatever you ask in faith, believing you have received it, will be done for you. \u0026quot;\nIn these last four years I have set aside discouragement and believed for healing and deliverance. I have seen hundreds of instant healings and hundreds of healings coming in the days following prayer. Around 70% of those who have asked for healing have been healed.\nWe have seen healing of everything from aches and pains and colds to broken bones, blindness, deafness, dumbness, the lame, epilepsy, depression, nervous breakdown, cancer, heart disease, post viral weakness, genetic diseases, decades of arthritis.\nAll this and I\u0026rsquo;m just an ordinary member of a dozy village Anglican church. My day job is teaching people how to program computers. There was no one in the church encouraging me. I\u0026rsquo;ve not been to a healing and miracles conference nor had someone lay hands on me. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been slain in the spirit or visited the third heaven. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I have a gift of healing; I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to believe the Gospels and giving it a go. And I am not anything unusual. You only have to look on YouTube to find dozens of videos of ordinary believers taking healing onto the streets of their communities. God is on the move to bear witness to his kingdom wherever people have the courage to believe what Jesus said. If you are thinking \u0026ldquo;those promises are for me too, I\u0026rsquo;m going to take risks and believe God.\u0026rdquo; well that\u0026rsquo;s wonderful. But I warn you that every act of faith involves a fight of faith. I had a friend who had received multiple miraculous healings and then died of cancer. Every disappointment requires you to get up again, reassert your faith, refuse to give up and then look for an opportunity to have another go.\nPerhaps you have previously been bold in faith and given up in despair. I have been there countless times. I have a deep and lifelong relationship with crushing disappointment. It is the cancer of our faith that we just have to keep fighting. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how I have survived but it is certainly by God\u0026rsquo;s grace and with his help, and I think also my constant reading of the Gospels. Every day for the last four years I have read a chapter of the Gospels. I am fully persuaded that it is the father\u0026rsquo;s good pleasure to give me the kingdom.\nAlthough healing and deliverance had featured quite significantly in my ministry these last few years, that is not really my focus. It is the kingdom that excites me.\nBut since Jesus' proclamation of the kingdom was founded upon healing and deliverance, so, I believe, must mine be. Mk 1:14-15 Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the good news of God. \u0026ldquo;The time has come; the kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe the good news.\u0026rdquo;\nJesus came to announce that the long promised kingdom was now here and he is the king. That was the good news. It is the Gospel that I too am commissioned to proclaim. Jesus said all authority has been given to him and he is with us to go and do what he did. How can I proclaim Jesus is king if I can\u0026rsquo;t demonstrate it in healing and deliverance? Without that all I have is \u0026ldquo;Jesus is king in heaven, but the devil rules on earth.\u0026rdquo;\nBut, we are told, Jesus came to destroy the works of the evil one. Jesus is king and his kingdom is at hand. It is within us and flows out from us. He is not just king in name but in reality. He is not just king on judgement day but now. The ascension was not the end of his rule on earth but the beginning of his rule over all the earth. Furthermore the kinship of Jesus needs to be demonstrated not only in church but out there in the community. We can go door knocking or treasure hunting or healing on the streets. We can offer healing to our unbelieving friends. \u0026ldquo;The time has come, the kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe the good news.\u0026rdquo;\nIt is time for us to repent and believe.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"268de41bca90b0ee088ce46657e13285","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/how-i-came-to-believe-in-healing/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/how-i-came-to-believe-in-healing/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"The Kingdom of God Jesus' teaching about the Kingdom has had a profound effect on my life in recent years.

But Jesus very clearly tells us NOT to pray like unbelievers pray:\n \u0026quot;When you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.\u0026quot; Matthew 6:7-8\n\u0026quot;So do not worry, saying, \u0026lsquo;What shall we eat?\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;What shall we drink?\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;What shall we wear?\u0026rsquo; For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.\u0026quot; Matthew 6:31-33\n Jesus says that bringing our basic needs to God in prayer is not a sign of faith, but of unbelief! It means we do not trust that God cares for us out of His love.\nJesus says that worrying and praying about our basic needs is what pagans do, and we should not behave like them. Jesus tells us that we should simply trust our heavenly Father to provide for our needs according to His love and wisdom.\nInstead of long or frequent prayers about our personal or family needs, we should trust God for those and instead be praying for His Kingdom to come to our family, our community, our nation and the world.\nPray like Jesus prayed When Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, He made this very simple prayer:\n Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, \u0026ldquo;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. And I know that You always hear Me.\u0026rdquo; John 11:41-42\n This is how we should pray: with the complete confidence that our Father has heard our prayer, and always hears our prayers. Later in this study we will see the promises for God to answer our prayers. Let's stop praying like pagans, and start praying like Jesus...\nPrayer is How God Works The first thing to understand about prayer is that it is not about humans getting God to do things. Prayer is the internal communication within the trinity:\n **\u0026quot;**You are My Son, today I have begotten You. Ask of Me, and I will give You The nations for Your inheritance.\u0026quot; Psalm 2:7-8\nAnd Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, \u0026ldquo;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. And I know that You always hear Me.\u0026rdquo; John 11:41-42\n\u0026quot;I pray for those you have given me, for they are yours.\u0026quot; John 17:9\nTherefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. Hebrews 7:25\n Jesus tells us what the Father has commanded Him to do:\n \u0026quot;And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.\u0026quot; (John 6:39)\n And so He prays to the Father:\n \u0026quot;My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.\u0026quot; (John 17:15).\n This heavenly intercession is a mystery, but one we must whole-heartedly embrace. Asking and giving and receiving through prayer is how the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit relate to one another in love and complete unity. So what can we say about prayer within the Godhead?\n  There is no reluctance\n  There is no need for persuasion\n  There is no need for one to inform the other about needs\n  There is complete agreement\n  Asking and giving and receiving through prayer is always a delight\n  Even though God always knows all things He still functions through prayer\n  Prayer is God's \u0026quot;Language of Love\u0026quot;\n  Prayer is Sharing in God's Language of Love Couples who love one another usually develop a secret language of love - small actions or special phrases that each understand to be a special message of love. That is what prayer is like within the Godhead. It is how they share love between them.\nIt is an incredible thing that God invites us to share in their language of love; in prayer. Prayer is not long-distance communication. It is not like texting or emailing God, it is intimate communion. However remote God might feel to us when we pray, that is how how God sees it.\n \u0026ldquo;For through Jesus we have access by one Spirit to the Father.\u0026rdquo; Eph 2:18\n\u0026quot;Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings.\u0026quot; Hebrews 10:22\n Prayer is an adventure exploring the very heart of God and sharing in His passions and purposes for the world. To truly pray is to be caught up with the Holy Spirit into God's throne room; not to plead with God but to rule with him. Prayer and especially intercession is sharing in the divine nature and as such is an expression and experience of deep intimacy with God.\nPrayer therefore starts with listening, \u0026quot;Lord, please show me what is on your heart for this situation. Can I join in the heavenly intercession for this?\u0026quot;\nThis holy privilege of access to the throne, before whom angels bow, shielding their eyes from the intensity of the glory, is not to be taken lightly or abused by hasty or covetous requests. In that place we pray with Jesus:\n \u0026quot;... nevertheless, not my will, but Your will be done ... May Your Kingdom come on earth.\u0026quot; (Matthew 26:39, 6:10)\n It is as we rest in Christ that we are included in this intimate relationship of prayer:  \u0026ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you\u0026rdquo; (John 14:20).\n\u0026ldquo;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.\u0026rdquo; (John 15:7)\n There is no reluctance  \u0026quot;Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.\u0026quot; Luke 12:32\n\u0026ldquo;And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.\u0026rdquo; John 14:13\n There is no need for persuasion  \u0026quot;Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name ... Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.\u0026quot; John 16:23\n There is no need to inform God about our needs  \u0026ldquo;Therefore do not heap up empty words like the heathen. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 6:8\n There is no need to shout Shouting prayers is how the unbelieving heathen behave:\n Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened. 1 Ki 18:26-27\n There is need to rest  \u0026quot;Wait on the LORD; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart; wait, I say, on the LORD!\u0026quot; Psalm 27:14\n\u0026quot;But those who wait on the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.\u0026quot; Isaiah 40:31\nBut if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance. Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. Rom 8:25\n Jesus teaches us to expect \u0026quot;Yes\u0026quot; as the answer It is quite apparent that Jesus knew His followers would have great difficulty with the idea that prayer works; at least 25 times in the gospels Jesus urged His disciples to believe that God answers prayer.\nSix times in one breath Jesus reiterated this simple truth:\n \u0026ldquo;Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 7:7-8\n We can hardly escape the conclusion that Jesus intended His disciples to approach God in prayer with the assurance and confidence that they would obtain what they asked. This conclusion is overwhelmingly reinforced when the other recorded words of Jesus concerning answered prayer are considered. Just look at this selection:\n \u0026ldquo;Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven.\u0026rdquo; Mat 18:19\n\u0026ldquo;And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.\u0026rdquo; Mat 21:22\n\u0026ldquo;Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.\u0026rdquo; Mark 11:24\n\u0026ldquo;And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.\u0026rdquo; John 14:13-14\n\u0026ldquo;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.\u0026rdquo; John 15:7\n\u0026ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you.\u0026rdquo; John 15:16\n\u0026ldquo;And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.\u0026rdquo; John 16:23-24\n The truth concerning prayer is that God answers. Nothing more complicated than this simple truth is required as the foundation for faith in prayer. From this truth we draw the motivation to seek God and to pursue the degree of abiding and intimacy in which answered prayer is a regular experience.\nGod listens to our Heart, not our words  \u0026ldquo;But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words. Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 6:6-8\n\u0026lsquo;But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you\u0026rsquo; Matthew 6:33.\nIf you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!\u0026quot; Matthew 7:11\n Prayer is how the Job gets Done  \u0026ldquo;The harvest truly is plentiful, but the labourers are few. Therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into His harvest.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 9:37-38\nYou did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit\u0026mdash;fruit that will last\u0026mdash;and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you. John 15:16\n\u0026quot;Will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. Luke 18:7\n\u0026quot;Pray for us ... so that I may be restored to you the sooner.\u0026quot; Heb 13:18\n\u0026quot;Pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word\u0026quot; Col 4:3\n Prayer is often difficult It is unnatural Believing that you are in intimate communion with the God of the Universe whom you cannot see, hear or feel is a pretty stupid delusion according to normal human reason. It's not like any other kind of relationship we have experienced. Is it surprising that we often find prayer difficult?\n But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. 1 Cor 2:14\n Answers may take time coming A part of the mystery of prayer is that intercession takes time. God does not tell us why, He just tells us that it does:\n And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\u0026quot; Luke 18:7-8\n God promises to answer quickly the prayers of those who cry out day and night. The intercession of Jesus and the Holy Spirit are ongoing and persistent. As we share in that intercession we also need to share in persistence until we know we have our answer or we actually see the answer. This also is a matter of hearing God.\nIn the face of a delay we must be like God \u0026quot;who calls things that are not as if they were\u0026quot; (Rom 4:18) and like Abraham grow strong in our faith as we give glory to God.\nWhen we don't know how to pray Romans 8:26-27 describes the Holy Spirit interceding with groans that cannot be uttered when we don't know how to pray as we ought. This is the Holy Spirit interceding on our behalf, or through us on behalf of another. This is a kind of praying in the Spirit, usually in tongues, or sometimes with literal groans. Again it must be with faith, and it usually feels like labouring in prayer, with an eventual sense of completion.\nPaul describes travailing in prayer for the Galatians as if in child birth (Gal 4:19).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6b5f697e907d1f4def028bb23f150c55","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/how-to-pray/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/how-to-pray/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"How to Pray Not Like the Pagans Prayer is so natural that virtually everyone prays \u0026ndash; even atheists!

If God is so powerful and loving, why doesn\u0026rsquo;t He do something about the innocent who suffer for the guilty, the global injustice and the collapse of standards of right or wrong?\nBut what is it that God has to stop? It\u0026rsquo;s people! It\u0026rsquo;s hatred, violence, lust, selfishness, dishonesty and a whole host of other things in people. So the question is \u0026ldquo;are you prepared to let God stop these things in you?\u0026rdquo; The issue is essentially a personal one. What about your selfishness, your jealousy, your greed? If you will not let God change you, then you have the answer to \u0026ldquo;Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t God stop the trouble?\u0026rdquo;\nOne thing is certain \u0026ndash; that God will stop it all one day; and if we refuse to let God into our lives to forgive us and change us then inevitably we will be judged and found guilty. If God appears to be inactive now, it is because He is dealing with people in mercy instead of judgement. He is giving you and me the chance to change.\nSo what is the Christian message? The most famous expression of the Christian message is Jesus' own words recorded in John 3:16 \u0026ldquo;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\u0026rdquo;\nThis clearly needs a little explanation:\nGod, our maker, wants to restore our relationship with Him, which we have broken by choosing to go our own way. In going our own way we end up doing all kinds of wrong. God sent Jesus to warn us that our wrong doing would lead, when we die, to a terrible punishment from God, which He called Hell. Jesus came to save us from this punishment.\nGod loves us so much that He sent His Son Jesus to take the punishment that we deserve. Jesus' death on the cross was not the failure of His mission that it seemed; it was in fact the fulfilment of His mission: the self-sacrifice of God the Son taking the punishment for all our wrongs upon Himself. Since our penalty has been paid, God is able to forgive us and restore our relationship with Him.\nGod has acted to save us from Hell, but to benefit from His provision we have to make our response. We must acknowledge our guilt, ask God for forgiveness and commit ourselves to living His way instead of ours. In choosing God\u0026rsquo;s way we can enjoy a new relationship with Him which will go on forever, even after we die.\nThe rest of this booklet explores and explains these things further so that a person wanting to be restored to God might truly find Him.\n Part 2 \u0026ndash; What is Salvation? You have probably heard the expression \u0026ldquo;born again Christian\u0026rdquo; but what does it mean? Jesus used the expression \u0026lsquo;born again\u0026rsquo; to describe what it is like to become a Christian:\n \u0026ldquo;No one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.\u0026rdquo; (John 3:3)\n This expression was used by Jews to describe someone who converted to Judaism1 . A Gentile who was circumcised and baptised and vowed to be subject to the Law of Moses was considered to be a new person. All of their previous identity, including any sins and even any financial debts were forgotten. The old person had died and the convert was born again as a Jew. Jesus used this same language to speak of those who follow Him in John 3:1-12. To become a true Christian is to be born again, to be forgiven all past sin and have a new start. But salvation is more than a new start and it involves more than a simple decision. This study is designed to help you understand both what is involved in salvation and how you can fully enter into it.\nSalvation in four parts The bible describes four distinct parts of salvation. They are known as election, justification, sanctification and glorification (see Romans 8:30). These are not words in common usage and so need some explanation. A Christian continually grows in both understanding and experience of salvation and only a basic grasp of these ideas is required for someone wanting to become a Christian.\nElection (which happens before we become a Christian) Most people who become Christians recognise that they had not been seeking God as much as God had been pursuing them! C. S. Lewis tells of a non-Christian friend who wrote to him, worried because he found that most of his friends were Christians and that he was becoming unsure of his committed atheist stand. Lewis wrote back saying that it sounded as if the Holy Spirit was after him and that he doubted if he would get away. This is election. It is God taking the initiative to reveal himself to people who thought that they were not interested. Jesus said that \u0026ldquo;No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him.\u0026rdquo; (John 6:44)\nJustification (which happens when we become a Christian) Having got our attention and convinced us of our need for salvation, God invites us to turn to Him and accept the death of Jesus as God\u0026rsquo;s payment for our sin. Accepting Jesus means we must reject our attempts at self-righteousness and say \u0026ldquo;I am a sinner worthy of God\u0026rsquo;s wrath but Jesus paid the penalty for me so that I can go free.\u0026rdquo; Justification means that God looks at us and says \u0026ldquo;There is a sinner who was on the road to hell, but he/she has accepted My payment for his/her sin so that I am now able to love them freely, even though they are still far from perfect.\u0026rdquo; (See Romans 5:1) Some people use the phrase \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s just-as-if-I\u0026rsquo;d never sinned\u0026rdquo; to remind them what \u0026lsquo;justified\u0026rsquo; means.\nThe essential fact of our justification is that Jesus' death on the cross justifies us and not our efforts to be good. We are \u0026lsquo;born again\u0026rsquo; when we are justified. Jesus said that in order to enter the kingdom of God (be born again), one must be born of water (baptism) and Spirit (receiving the Holy Spirit) (John 3:5). It is not simply a matter of what we believe, or of praying a particular prayer, it is a process involving God\u0026rsquo;s work and our response resulting in a new life \u0026ndash; a justified life.\nSanctification (which happens whilst we grow as a Christian) We do not become Christians by being good, but we cannot grow as Christians by staying bad. One of the things that we discover as we grow in the faith is that God does not want to take away our enjoyment of life, rather, He wants to save us from those things which harm us. Sanctification is the process of breaking the pattern of independence from God so that we become more like Christ. It is a work of the Holy Spirit in our lives and is a wonderfully liberating experience (See Philippians 1:6). It is mostly a gradual thing, though there are often periods of rapid growth. We can co-operate with God in this or oppose Him.\nGlorification (which happens after we die as a Christian) The climax of the Christian faith is what happens after we die. It is not just \u0026lsquo;pie in the sky\u0026rsquo; or harp strumming. We are presented to Jesus as part of His \u0026lsquo;bride\u0026rsquo; and receive all the glory that you could imagine would be given to the bride of the King of the universe! We do not know all the detail concerning this, but we know enough to provide great hope and motivation in this life (See 1 Peter 1:3-6). You will learn much more about our glorification as you grow in faith.\nPart 3 \u0026ndash; How do I become a Christian? The Christian life is established upon the \u0026lsquo;foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands (receiving the Holy Spirit), of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgement (Hebrews 6:1-2).\nThe first four parts of this foundation \u0026ndash; repentance, faith, baptism and receiving the Holy \u0026ndash; are the essential acts or experiences required to become a Christian. Resurrection and eternal judgement are important teachings which are intended to lead us to conviction of our independence from God and to repentance.\nRepentance in three parts Repentance refers to a change of heart producing a change of direction. When God reveals to us that an attitude or act comes from a proud independence from God, is harmful, and we have a deep desire to change to become more like Christ, then we are experiencing repentance. It is not something that happens only once but it is an ongoing experience of God\u0026rsquo;s work in our lives. Repentance involves conviction, confession and changed behaviour.\nBefore explaining these three aspects of repentance consider this illustration:\nYou may remember the Chinoble nuclear power station disaster. The surrounding area was badly contaminated with radioactive particles rendering it unsuitable for habitation. Suppose a family living there had their granny living with them who loved her garden and could not be persuaded to leave. The local authority had distributed warning leaflets explaining the invisible peril and its inevitable result of terminal cancer and the urgent need for people to move out of the area. They provided alternative accommodation for the displaced people and transport etc. But granny cannot see or feel the radiation and thinks its just a government ploy to get them off land that they want to redevelop. The family tries desperately to convince her but she will not be convinced of her peril. They move away to safety leaving granny with her garden.\nAfter a few weeks all her flowers have gone spotty, all the birds have died and granny slowly realises that her continual stomach upset is getting worse rather than better. She recognises the reality of the radiation and the truth of all the warnings and so is convicted of her hardness of heart in refusing the pleadings of her family. She confesses to them that she is now ready to heed their warnings. She packs her bags and moves away. She is convicted, confesses her change of heart and changes her behaviour.\nConviction Conviction is being convinced of something. God wants to convince us of our guilt before Him and our need for salvation. Yet the purpose of conviction is not to make us feel like convicts but to show us God\u0026rsquo;s perspective on our lives, so that we can see our need and turn to God for help. God\u0026rsquo;s aim is not to leave us feeling guilty but to turn us from our sin and remove our guilt and shame (see 2 Corinthians 7:9-10).\nMost people will readily accept that their lives are not perfect and even that they have made a mess of them, but many have no recognition of their guilt before God. They cannot see what their lives have to do with God.\nIt is not so difficult to see that we could benefit from some help from God to live better lives. There may be a sudden dawning upon us that the way we have lived our lives has caused great harm to ourselves or others. We may feel regret or remorse for things we have done. It is often the unpleasant consequences of sin or weaknesses in our character that we regret and which may cause us to look to God for a remedy. We may recognise our need for help to sort out our lives and turn to God to obtain that help.\nAll this is good to recognise, but it is basically man-centred. It does not get to the heart of the problem which is that our greatest and most serious sin has been against God Himself. True repentance recognises, as the Psalmist did, that \u0026ldquo;Against You God, You only, have I sinned, and done what is evil in Your sight\u0026rdquo; (Psalm 51:4) \u0026ndash; this is conviction. It is God Himself that should take centre stage in repentance, not us. The gospel is not primarily concerned with putting our lives back together, but with putting our relationship with God back together.\nRepentance requires an understanding of the true nature of sin. We tend to think of sin in terms of acts that are ultimately harmful to ourselves or others, especially where they are harmful to loving and open relationships. Thus, for instance, I sin if I lie to you. But this is not God\u0026rsquo;s definition of sin. God defines sin as our living in independence from Him. Even if we do wonderful good, if it is done in independence from God, we commit sin. It is not the good deeds that are sinful, but our independence.\nGod created Adam and Eve for relationship with Him. Satan tempted them with a promise that eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil would enable them to \u0026ldquo;be like God\u0026rdquo; so that they would no longer be dependant upon Him (Genesis 3:5). This is the issue at the heart of repentance. Our sin is in living our lives without depending upon God for guidance and strength and in so doing, preferring our fallen wisdom above His boundless love. In our ignorance and blindness we accuse God of being uncaring or incompetent when in fact He is our maker and the one person in all creation who loves us with unfaltering passion and care. Thus, it is primarily against Him that we sin whilst we make a mess of our lives through doing it our own way.\nBecause true repentance is focussed on our sin against God, whom we cannot see, it requires revelation. Revelation of this perspective on our sin is the purpose of conviction. It is a work of the Holy Spirit which we should earnestly ask Him to do in our hearts. It is also a process that starts around the time we are born-again and should continue throughout our walk with God.\nConviction of the true nature of our sin is thus a precursor to repentance. Conviction that makes true repentance possible is evidenced by three signs2 :\n  Awareness of a wrong relationship with God: not just with one\u0026rsquo;s neighbour or one\u0026rsquo;s own conscience, but with one\u0026rsquo;s Maker; the God on whom one depends for existence every moment. It is the awareness of being in a broken relationship with God that spells rejection and wrath and which, whatever the cost, must be restored.\n  Awareness of personal guilt and responsibility for specific sins from which one needs to turn.\n  Awareness of personal sinfulness; of having a corrupt nature from which one needs deliverance.\n  Psalm 51 is a psalm of conviction and repentance and may help to elicit or explain conviction.\nConfession Being born again as a Christian is the beginning of a new life, not just a new experience or interest in our life. This new life comes about through our death to our old life. Baptism (see below) is our public witness to the fact that through faith in Jesus, we have identified ourselves with Him in His death upon the cross and also with His resurrection. We have died to our old way of life and have received new spiritual life by receiving the Holy Spirit. If, through the conviction of the Holy Spirit, we recognise that we have lived in rebellion towards God then we will want to turn away from our past sinful attitudes and behaviour as much as we are able. Confession of our sin helps us to do this.\nThe apostle Paul talks about us being slaves to sin in our past life (Romans 6:16-23). Jesus breaks the power of sin and allows us to walk free from these \u0026ldquo;yokes of bondage\u0026rdquo;. Paul urges us not to get entangled with them again (Galatians 5:1). If we do carry these yokes into our new life with Christ, it is never too late to deal with them, but surely it is better to start our new life free from the yokes that have bound us \u0026ndash; and then make sure we don\u0026rsquo;t pick them up again!\nConfession helps us to start our new life as unburdened as possible. The purpose is not simply to get guilt off our chest, but sin out of our lives. Confession of sin is the acknowledgement of our guilt with the firm intention of changing. Confession of specific sins is necessary so as to avoid vague generalities which leave the heart unchanged: \u0026ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\u0026rdquo; (1 John 1:9). This may be with someone else present or on our own before God and is best verbalised rather than just thought. Confession of our sin should not leave us feeling exposed, but wonderfully clean. For someone becoming a Christian, there are probably four specific areas of confession to be considered.\nConfessing self-righteousness (pride) Elements of self-righteousness are:\n  Accusing God of injustice or unfaithfulness or lack of love. This places us in the position of judge over God which is unbelievably arrogant, but very common, even normal! (See Romans 9:20-21)\n  Unbelief. This is not simply a lack of faith. It is a wilful disregard of the facts and evidence of Jesus\u0026rsquo; life in favour of disbelief for the purpose of avoiding conviction of sin or personal responsibility. God commands belief (1 John 3:23) and condemns unbelief (Mark 16:14, Hebrews 3:12). Unbelief is ultimately an issue of the heart, not the head; that is, it is usually a moral rather than an intellectual problem.\n  Excusing ourselves, thinking that we are not too bad. This is self deception, keeping us from calling upon God for salvation and preventing us from putting our trust in Jesus for our justification. Many people are afraid of admitting their sin because they are afraid of condemnation, but, in fact, it is the very act of justifying ourselves that makes condemnation such a threat.\nIsaiah 64:6 But we are all like an unclean thing, and all our righteousness is like filthy rags; we all fade as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. (See also Philippians 3:8-9)\nSelf righteousness stops us from receiving the forgiveness and peace of Christ. It needs careful attention and you may need a Christian to help you recognise and repent from it.\n  Confessing ungodly behaviour Contrary to common belief, Christianity is not for \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; people, but for bad people who know they need help. You may find that you are caught up in all sorts of situations that involve ungodly behaviour; perhaps being under pressure to fiddle forms at work or claiming unlawful benefits or involvement in an ungodly relationship. You do not have to put all this right before you can become a Christian, but you do need to come with a genuine desire to have God help you sort your life out. A first step is to confess to God everything that you know about which you think is wrong in your life and ask Him to help you live His way.\nConfessing unforgiveness towards others Jesus said that if we don\u0026rsquo;t forgive others, then He will not forgive us (Matthew 6:14). If we are asking God to forgive us for all that we have done and thought wrong, then we must also be prepared to forgive everyone, everything that they have done to us. Again, you do not have to get this all sorted out before you become a Christian, but you must want to get it all sorted out, and confessing the situations to God is an important first step.\nConfessing occult involvement A great many people have had some sort of occult involvement and, as much as is possible, any known involvement must be specifically confessed, renounced and turned from. If you, or any close family member or ancestor, are known to have been involved in anything in the list below, this should be made known to a responsible, experienced Christian since there may be the need for further help in coming to repentance and gaining freedom from all occult influence. Any addictions, dependencies, compulsions and mental problems should be shared in case they have occult roots.\nA-Z of possible occult influences: astrology, automatic writing, bestiality, black or white magic, blood pacts, charms, clairvoyance, cults (including Christian science, J.W.\u0026rsquo;s etc.), divining, E.S.P., eastern meditation, exclusive Christian fellowships, faith healing, fantasy games (e.g. Dungeons and dragons), fortune telling, freemasonry, homosexuality, horoscopes, hypnosis, levitation, martial arts (e.g. karate), mediums, metaphysics, mysticism, necromancy, new age medicine (all alternative treatments should be mentioned as some are occult based) , new age philosophy, occult literature, Ouija boards, paganism, pornography, science fiction (some are occult based), sexual perversion, seances, superstitions, Tarot cards, telepathy, trances, Transcendental meditation, witchcraft, Yoga, Zodiac charms.\nPrayer for possible occult influences is best shared with at least two mature Christians.\nChanged behaviour \u0026ndash; the evidence of repentance The fact that sin is defined as living in independence from God shows us that repentance means that we must now trust God as Lord of our lives. That means referring our decisions to Him, asking and trusting Him for guidance and obeying His will as He reveals it to us. This is not simply religious jargon. It is a practical day to day working out of a whole new way of conducting our lives in relation to God rather than in isolation from God. It is not simply bringing God into our lives, but rather, bringing our lives to God. The Lordship of Christ starts with repentance and is worked out as we grow in our relationship with God over the years.\nRepentance must be specific and have its fruits and not be just an intellectual generality. Reasonable evidence of repentance is required before a person is baptised (See Luke 3:8 and Acts 26:20), but perfection is not to be expected! Repentance does not guarantee that we will not continue to commit the same sins (that may take some time and good biblical teaching), but repentance does produce a genuine desire to stop living in independence from God.\nJesus was in no hurry to press people into the kingdom, on the contrary, He turned away those who were half hearted. Jesus required devotion and obedience, not just sentimental expressions of \u0026ldquo;Oh yes! I believe in Jesus\u0026rdquo; (Luke 14:26-33, Luke 18:18-26). Jesus requires us to walk in the light; to be truthful with Him and with one another (John 3:19-21, 1 John 1:5-7). We are required to forgive and accept others if we are to receive forgiveness from God (Matthew 6:14, Romans 15:7). And we are to love one another in the body of Christ deeply, with a sincere heart (1 Peter 1:22).\nThese requirements are not burdensome to those who have understood their need for salvation and who know that God loves them unconditionally and has their best interests at heart (see John 14:21, 1 John 5:3).\nSo this is repentance: conviction, confession and changed behaviour. It is the first part of the process of becoming a Christian. The second part is to believe; to start trusting God.\nFaith Faith is not blind belief in the unlikely or impossible, nor is it based upon feelings. On the contrary, faith is firmly based upon facts. It is the facts that are believed that are effective, not the act of believing, but for us to benefit from those facts we do have to believe them and put our trust in them.\nIn the New Testament there is one Greek word (pistis) which, as a verb, is generally translated \u0026lsquo;believe\u0026rsquo; and, as a noun, \u0026lsquo;faith\u0026rsquo;. Faith is what you have if you believe the facts sufficiently to actually trust them. When a man let Blondin wheel him in a barrow across the Niagara Falls on a tight rope it was an act of trust based upon confident belief which in turn was based on sound facts (he had just seen him walk across with terrific confidence). This kind of trust is what the bible means by \u0026lsquo;faith\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;belief\u0026rsquo;. It is evident that the safety of the man in the barrow depended not on his faith, but on the truth of the claim that Blondin made about his ability. Given that God\u0026rsquo;s claims are true, our experience of them depends upon our faith.\nJesus said, \u0026ldquo;He who believes in Me has everlasting life.\u0026rdquo; (John 6:47) but what exactly must be believed?\n  Jesus is God\u0026rsquo;s Son and our saviour\n\u0026ldquo;These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.\u0026rdquo; (John 20:31)\n  God is who He says He is\n\u0026ldquo;He who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgement, but has passed from death into life.\u0026rdquo; (John 5:24)\n  Jesus was raised from the dead\n\u0026ldquo;If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.\u0026rdquo; (Romans 10:9)\n  We are justified by Jesus' death\n  \u0026ldquo;Our right-standing with God comes from God, through faith in Jesus Christ, as a gift to all who believe. There is no difference between good people and bad people; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. We are put right with God freely through faith in His provision \u0026ndash; His Son who, through His death, took the penalty for our rebellion against God upon Himself. By this means, God was able to deliver us from the penalty for our sin without denying its seriousness. He rightly judged us guilty and worthy of death, but provided His own Son to die in place of those who put their trust in Jesus' death.\u0026rdquo; (Romans 3:22-26, my paraphrase)\nHaving understood the facts concerning salvation, and having come to a place of believing them, we can only benefit from God\u0026rsquo;s saving action by putting our trust in Him. We must call out in prayer to God for Him to cleanse our hearts, forgive us our rebellion against Him and give us a new start. Repeating a set prayer is probably not the most meaningful way that a repentant soul can call on God for salvation! It should be a personal appeal to God.\nBaptism Jesus commanded His followers to be baptised: \u0026ldquo;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\u0026rdquo; (Mat 28:19). Baptism is not optional for a believer; Jesus commanded it and so did the apostles: \u0026ldquo;And he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord (Acts 10:48). When the apostle Paul believed in Jesus, Ananias said to him, \u0026ldquo;And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptised, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.\u0026rdquo; (= call out to God on the basis of Jesus' death.) (Acts 22:16).\nBaptism is an intrinsic part of becoming a Christian. The gospel message is to \u0026ldquo;repent and be baptised\u0026rdquo; (Acts 2:38). In the New Testament, baptism is the immediate outward act which signifies faith in Jesus. There was no question of delaying baptism until after a course of teaching or until elaborate arrangements were made. The nearest suitable pool of water was utilised to confirm a person\u0026rsquo;s faith by baptism (see Acts 8:36-38).\nOver the years the church has tended to depart from the New Testament practice of baptism, either by not baptising believers or by separating it in time or understanding from the moment of coming to faith in Jesus.\nWhat if I was baptised as an infant? Many people have been christened or baptised as infants and may wonder if they should be baptised as believers when they come to put their trust in Jesus. Jesus commanded that those who put their faith in Jesus should be baptised and we strongly urge believers to begin their life of obedience to Christ by obeying His command to be baptised. (Even Jesus, who was faithfully circumcised in the temple as a baby insisted that He be baptised as a believer, Mark 3:13-17).\nWhat is baptism? In New Testament times baptism was an everyday occurrence. There were baptism baths at every synagogue and in many larger homes. Devout Jews would baptise themselves daily in an act of ritual washing (see Heb 9:10). Baptism was also used to signify that a person was devoted to a particular Rabbi (Jn 3:23ff, Acts 19:3). Baptism was usually self-administered by fully immersing oneself in a bath or pool, but when this was not possible drenching with buckets of water was acceptable.3\nBaptism (Greek baptizo usually means to be fully immersed in water, like a sunken ship) is a physical event with a spiritual effect. It is not merely a sign or symbol, but an integral part of the process of conversion. Through baptism, God washes us from the presence and effect of our sin, so that we have a clean conscience before God (see below 2 Peter 3:21, Titus 3:5). In baptism we identify ourselves with Christ in His death and resurrection. We die to our old lives and are \u0026lsquo;born again\u0026rsquo; as God\u0026rsquo;s children:\n \u0026ldquo;Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life\u0026rdquo; (Romans 6:4).\n What does Baptism do? Baptism has a number of different aspects.\n  Obedience. Baptism is to be completely covered and saturated by the medium in which we are baptised. Baptism in water means we are covered by the water. Baptism in Jesus means that we are submerged in Jesus, saturated by His life and submitted to His Lordship. Baptism seals our intention to be obedient to Jesus Christ.\n  Cleansed conscience. We submerge ourselves in water in order to cleans ourselves. Baptism in Jesus washes us from our sin and guilt. In fact it is the Holy Spirit who does this washing:\n   \u0026ldquo;Be baptised and wash your sins away\u0026rdquo; (Acts 22:16).\n\u0026ldquo;You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 6:11).\n\u0026ldquo;He saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit\u0026rdquo; (Titus 3:5).\n\u0026ldquo;Baptism is not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the appeal of a good conscience toward God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ\u0026rdquo; (1 Pet 3:21).\n  Death to our sinful nature. Going under the water symbolises the end of our previous life. Baptism in Jesus is an identification with His death on the cross. \u0026ldquo;Do you not know that all of us who were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into His death?\u0026rdquo; (Romans 6:3). This is not the bad news that it sounds like. It is amazingly good news. No other god offers death as a means to life. It is the stubborn grip with which we grasp our own lives which prevents us from receiving God\u0026rsquo;s life. Sin is an addiction for which there is only one cure ‑ death! Everyone will be cured one day. Everyone will die. But Christ offers us the opportunity to die right now instead of having to wait for the end of our lives. It is incredible. In this day when everything is instant and people are not interested if you cannot give them what they want straight away, you offer them the chance of instant death and they say \u0026ldquo;No thanks, I prefer to wait for the end of my life\u0026rdquo;. They do not know what they are missing! Jesus says to us \u0026ldquo;You know that habit you are struggling with, you know that thing you are addicted to, you know those reactions you cannot control... well, you can die right now in Me so that those things will no longer enslave you.\u0026rdquo; Well, I say, \u0026ldquo;If my flesh is condemned to die anyway, and it is only a hindrance to me, then let me die!\u0026rdquo; Baptism is our acceptance of this amazing offer.\n  New life. When we come up out of the water it is like a new birth. \u0026ldquo;We were buried with Him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life\u0026rdquo; (Romans 6:4). Jesus not only provides baptism in water for our death, but He is the water of Life. Even though we die with Christ, it is completely impossible for us to remain dead. All the mighty power of God is at work in Christ to make us alive (Ephesians 1:19‑20, 2:6). It is quite simply impossible for any one to resist that power. If we have died with Christ than we are also raised up with Him. The power that raised up Him who bore the sin of the whole world should just about be able to manage the burden of my sin! We do not have to try to be resurrected with Christ, God raises us up.\n  A changed nature. God does not make us better \u0026ndash; He makes us new! We do not receive the kiss of life. God has not condemned our flesh only to bring it back to life again. Resurrection is not restoration. God does not look at us and say, \u0026ldquo;We will put a patch on here, and replace that bit of rot there, oil this bit and polish that bit.\u0026rdquo; No! God says \u0026ldquo;Yuk, that old life is disgusting. We can\u0026rsquo;t do anything with that. It is beyond repair. Look, you had better have a new life. Here, have mine.\u0026rdquo; 2 Corinthians 5:17 \u0026ldquo;If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come.\u0026rdquo; Ephesians 4:24 \u0026ldquo;Put on the new nature, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.\u0026rdquo;\n  Discipleship. Baptism was a Jewish custom indicating that you were giving your allegiance to a particular teacher. In the Corinthian church some of the brothers were saying \u0026ldquo;I follow Paul\u0026rdquo;, some \u0026ldquo;I follow Apollos\u0026rdquo; and some \u0026ldquo;I follow Cephas\u0026rdquo; and the super spiritual ones \u0026ldquo;I follow Christ, so there!\u0026rdquo; So Paul says \u0026ldquo;Were you baptised into Paul? Christ did not send me to baptise but to preach the gospel\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 1:12‑17). The early Christians had to learn that baptism was not to symbolise their allegiance to a particular preacher, congregation or theological position, but their allegiance to Christ.\n   Jesus said that we were to \u0026ldquo;Make disciples ... and baptise them\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 28:19). He did not say \u0026ldquo;Make converts, baptise them and disciple those who will let you.\u0026rdquo; Conversion (what ever that means) is not the issue. It is discipleship. \u0026ldquo;He who hears these words of mine and does them, he is My disciple\u0026rdquo;. Baptism is the first act of obedience in a life devoted to obedience to Jesus.\n Declaration of our faith. Baptism is a declaration before witnesses (usually church, family and friends) that you have identified yourself with the death and resurrection of Jesus, who died to set you free from your sin and rose to give you new life. The person being baptised often wants to invite friends and family along. However, baptism should not be seen primarily as an evangelistic event. It is first and foremost a personal spiritual event in which the past is buried, the conscience cleansed and the power of the Holy Spirit received. The depth and reality of this spiritual experience should be paramount even in a large evangelistic event.  Baptism, then, means submission, repentance, death to the old life, being filled with His life, putting on the new nature and loving and obeying Him.\nJesus said that it was fitting to fulfil all righteousness in being baptised. And when He was baptised the Holy Spirit came upon Him, and God said \u0026ldquo;This is My Son in whom I am well pleased.\u0026rdquo; When we give ourselves to die and be raised again with Christ, Jesus says \u0026ldquo;I died for you, and I am so glad that I did!\u0026rdquo;\nHaving repented, started to believe and trust God, received the Holy Spirit and been baptised in water, you have completed the four steps of becoming a Christian; you have been \u0026lsquo;born again\u0026rsquo; and can look forward to growing in your faith as you are sanctified by the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit and look forward to your eventual glorification.\nReceiving the Holy Spirit Having repented, believed, called on God for salvation and begun to trust Him for His forgiveness and love, you are ready to receive the promised Holy Spirit. This is the third stage in becoming a Christian. It is the most crucial part of becoming a Christian. It is the Holy Spirit who makes us a child of God. Everything else is preparing the way for us to receive Him. It is a definite experience which usually precedes, but sometimes follows, water baptism, but never in the New Testament are the two events simultaneous4.\nIt is the Holy Spirit who gives us new life \u0026ndash; new-birth: Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit\u0026rdquo; (John 3:5-6). He said that after He had been glorified (ascended into heaven after His resurrection) the Holy Spirit would be given to those who put their trust in Him (John 7:38-39, 14:16,26, 15:26)\n \u0026ldquo;It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counsellor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.\u0026rdquo; (John 16:7)\n The Holy Spirit is God\u0026rsquo;s seal and guarantee that we have been adopted as His children (see Romans 8:16, Ephesians 1:13-14, 1 John 4:13). His presence within us is a witness to the powers of darkness that we belong to God, forbidding them power over our lives. It is also an inner witness to us as we recognise the Spirit within us crying out \u0026ldquo;Father\u0026rdquo; to our heavenly Father, bearing witness that we are His children.\nAlso He washes and renews our hearts and conscience:\n \u0026ldquo;He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.\u0026rdquo; (Titus 3:5)\n He helps us in our weakness:\n \u0026ldquo;The Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groans that words can not express.\u0026rdquo; (Romans 8:26)\n\u0026ldquo;I pray that He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.\u0026quot;\n(Ephesians 3:16-17)\n He gives us hope and joy:\n \u0026ldquo;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.\u0026rdquo; (Romans 15:13)\n He gives life to our mortal bodies:\n \u0026ldquo;If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit, who lives in you.\u0026rdquo; (Romans 8:11)\n He reveals the Fathers thoughts and plans for us:\n \u0026ldquo;No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him, but God has revealed it to us by His Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God\u0026rdquo;\n(1 Corinthians 2:9-10)\n He transforms us into the image of Christ:\n \u0026ldquo;We all, with unveiled face, behold as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.\u0026rdquo; (2 Corinthians 3:18)\n We know that we have received the Holy Spirit because He gives a witness within our hearts that we are now a child of God (Romans 8:16). Things will begin to change. You will find attitudes begin to change, believing God becomes easier, you will want to deal with sin in your life, you will experience inner peace and so on.\nBaptism in the Holy Spirit There seem to be three distinct levels or experiences of receiving the Holy Spirit, although the scriptures are not consistent in the words used to describe them and there is much ongoing debate about it. These are:\n  Receiving the indwelling Holy Spirit at conversion by which we cry \u0026ldquo;Abba Father\u0026rdquo; (Gal 4:6). The indwelling Holy Spirit produces a variety of godly fruits, just as the life sustaining sap in a tree produces fruit (See John 15 and Galatians 5:22-23). These are real, recognisable, effective and enduring. They grow in us rather than come upon us.\n  Being baptised in the Holy Spirit, by which we are empowered (Acts 1:8) and receive gifts for building up the church (1 Corinthians 12-14).\n  Being filled with the Holy Spirit which brings a special and temporary experience such as joy (Acts 13:52) or revelation (Acts 7:55).\n  Having received the indwelling Holy Spirit at conversion, we should ask God to baptise us in the Holy Spirit. This is described as a filling or a drink (Acts 2:4, Ephesians 5:18, 1 Corinthians 12:13) indicating the awareness of being filled by God and with God.\nThrough the Baptism in the Holy Spirit, the gifts of the Holy Spirit become available to us. These are things such as prophecy, revelation, visions, words of knowledge, healing, praying in tongues and interpretation of tongues. These gifts are given by the Holy Spirit to help us build up the church:\n \u0026ldquo;But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all.\u0026quot;\n(1 Corinthians 12:7)\n\u0026ldquo;Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 14:12)\n\u0026ldquo;When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 14:26)\n Having been baptised in the Holy Spirit, we need to stir up the gifts within us and use them:\n \u0026ldquo;Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.\u0026rdquo; (2 Timothy 1:6-7)\n Baptism in the Holy Spirit is normally received through the laying on of hands immediately following baptism:\n\u0026ldquo;When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.\u0026rdquo; (Acts 19:5-6)\nIt is usually evidenced by speaking in tongues or prophecy:\n \u0026ldquo;All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.\u0026rdquo; (Acts 2:4)\n\u0026ldquo;When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.\u0026rdquo; (Acts 19:6)\n Sometimes a person is not baptised in the Holy Spirit when they are first prayed for, and this can be distressing, but Jesus said that we should go on asking until He is received (Luke 11:13). It may be that there is some area of sin or unbelief or a curse which is hindering the receiving of the Holy Spirit, but this will come to light as we continue to pray.\nThe Holy Spirit coming upon us should not be seen as a once-off experience, but as the beginning of a lifetime of drinking and filling. Some people seem to have powerful experiences of the Holy Spirit coming upon them frequently, other much less frequently. The thing is to stay thirsty and keep drinking.\nSome people are baptised in the Holy Spirit without anyone praying for them; God just does it! Others receive when they pray for themselves, but most receive through others praying for them. Sometimes we may have to persevere in prayer for some time (\u0026ldquo;Ask, seek, knock \u0026hellip;\u0026quot;) or we may need to call on leaders with greater authority to pray (as in Samaria). But we should not give up praying and asking until the Holy Spirit has clearly been given. Jesus has promised the Holy Spirit and He wants us to be baptised in the Holy Spirit.\n18 Baptism in the Holy Spirit\nThe Gifts of the Holy Spirit In addition to all the blessings listed above, the Holy Spirit also gives various gifts for building ourselves up and strengthening the church. These are things such as prophecy, revelation, visions, words of knowledge, healing, praying in tongues and interpretation of tongues:\n\u0026ldquo;But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all\u0026hellip; the message of wisdom \u0026hellip; or knowledge, faith, gifts of healing, miraculous powers, prophecy, distinguishing between spirits, speaking in different kinds of tongues, and the interpretation of tongues.\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 12:7-10)\n\u0026ldquo;When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 14:26)\nHaving been baptised in the Holy Spirit, we need to stir up the spiritual gifts He gives us and use them:\n\u0026ldquo;Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 14:12)\n\u0026ldquo;Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.\u0026rdquo; (2 Timothy 1:6-7)\nSpeaking in Tongues The first gift most people receive is the gift of tongues. It is of tremendous benefit within both corporate and personal worship allowing the unhindered expression of our hearts to the Father without the limitation of having to form suitable words with our minds and understanding. It is a spirit inspired language which we cannot understand with our minds, but which we can use at our will to worship God, pray for situations and build up our spirits:\nHe who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. I would like every one of you to speak in tongues \u0026hellip; For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. If you are praising God with your spirit \u0026hellip;\u0026quot;\n(1 Corinthians 14:4-5,14-16)\n\u0026ldquo;Build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit.\u0026quot;**\n**(Jude 1:20)\nBaptism in the Holy Spirit 19\nAs Paul says here, when speaking in tongues, our minds are not involved. We can be thinking about anything under the sun whilst we are speaking in tongues. Therefore, whilst speaking in tongues we should also pray and worship God with our minds.\nMost people who speak in tongues wonder if they are just making up nonsense and this can put them off from using the gift. But it is important to understand that speaking in tongues is a spiritual act of faith which our flesh will usually object to. Remember that:\n\u0026ldquo;The sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature.\u0026rdquo; (Galatians 5:17)\n\u0026ldquo;The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 2:14)\nSpiritual discernment grows with practice \u0026ndash; and practice implies experimentation and getting it wrong sometimes. Even if we speak a load of gibberish when we first try to speak in tongues, God will very soon make it \u0026lsquo;spiritually\u0026rsquo; effective. It may be that our prophecies are mostly from us initially \u0026ndash; but the Father will be pleased to give maturity to these efforts so that His body may be increasingly built up.\nWe should practice using our spiritual language both on our own and in worship together. Sometimes singing in tongues will break through our fleshly weariness and bring us into a wonderful sense of God\u0026rsquo;s presence, other times we may not be conscious of any benefit at the time, but later we will reap the fruit of having persevered against the flesh in singing or praying in tongues.\nInterpretation of Tongues Having started to pray and worship in tongues we should ask God for the gift of interpretation of tongues:\n\u0026ldquo;For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says.\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 14:13)\nAn interpretation is not a literal word-for-word translation but the re-phrasing of what was given in the Spirit in the words of the person giving the interpretation. It will therefore have the characteristics of the person giving the interpretation, but the content has been revealed to their spirit by the Holy Spirit.\nWe may interpret our own tongue or that given by someone else. Usually it is a prayer or praise to God, but sometimes it is an encouragement or instruction from God. Often, two or more people will have the same interpretation which confirms that it is genuine. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about getting it wrong. If you have the slightest hint that God has given you the first word or two of an interpretation or prophecy, then say so. You can say \u0026ldquo;I think maybe the interpretation is\u0026hellip; (or God is saying \u0026hellip;).\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a complete picture. You may have the beginning and someone else the rest of it.\nProphecy Much that has been said about interpretation of tongues applies also to prophecy. It is Spirit to spirit communication which we have to find words in order to express. It will therefore be expressed through our words, character and understanding and will inevitably be incomplete and imperfect. But that does not make prophecy any less vital and significant. The gift of prophecy grows through use and you should keep stepping out in faith and let the person who is discipling you help you to learn to discern what is from God and what is from your imagination.\n20 Baptism in the Holy Spirit\nOther Spiritual gifts You will learn about the other gifts as you grow in your faith. The main thing is to keep pressing on by actively practising the gifts of tongues, interpretation and prophecy, and responding to the Holy Spirit whenever you think He may be prompting you.\nTesting the Gifts Just as God wants us to be confident of His love for us, and our acceptance in Christ, so also He wants us to be confident and secure in the Spiritual gifts. He says that we are to test, weigh and prove the Spiritual gifts. We are not testing God, but ourselves.\n\u0026ldquo;Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies. Test all things; hold fast what is good.\u0026rdquo; (1 Thessalonians 5:16)\nThis testing is done by the witness of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of the hearers, and is ultimately the responsibility of the leaders or elders present:\n\u0026ldquo;Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge.\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 14:29)\nGoing on in the Spirit The Holy Spirit coming upon us should not be seen as a once-off experience, but as the beginning of a lifetime of drinking and filling. Some people seem to have powerful experiences of the Holy Spirit coming upon them frequently, other much less frequently. The thing is to stay thirsty and keep drinking.\nHaving repented, started to believe and trust God, been baptised in water and in the Holy Spirit, you have completed the four steps of becoming a Christian; you have been \u0026lsquo;born again\u0026rsquo; and can look forward to growing in your faith as you are sanctified by the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit and look forward to your eventual glorification.\n  ^1^ W.

Dead on.\u0026rdquo; David Berlinski, The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and Its Scientific Pretensions\nHurdles to Scientific Atheism The Big Bang is predicted by Einstein's Field Equations, but it lacks any cause. Something made it happen, but theory offers no suggestions as to what.\nThe Big-Bang is the instantaneous creation of space, time and matter out of nothing. It is based on equations that describe probabilities, yet for the universe to exist it requires a virtually infinitely improbable minute imbalance between various types of sub-atomic particle ( a ratio of 10^9^: 1+10^9^) and an initial density equal to a critical density to an accuracy of 1:10^55^. Any variation from this critical density would result in a universe that lived for only 10^-44^ seconds or consisted of only scattered individual particles!\nThe equations of fundamental physics have no concept of \u0026quot;now\u0026quot; or of the direction of time (past and future). Although we observe processes, such as the increase of entropy, happening only in one direction, there is nothing in the underlying equations to say they only happen in one direction. Only observation supplies evidence for time having a direction, and it poses the question \u0026ndash; where did the original order originate from? This is a question that scientific theories have no answer for.\nQuantum Theory has proved very powerful at describing observable phenomena, including many biological processes. However its equations require an \u0026quot;observer\u0026quot; that is outside the quantum system \u0026ndash; indeed they strongly suggest that the observer must be conscious! Physicists and philosophers have no solution as to how that observer can arise \u0026ndash; what consciousness is and why it has such a decisive effect on quantum particles!\nLife requires water on planet earth. Yet the science of planet formation means that any water that was present in the cosmic dust from which the earth formed would have evaporated into space long before life could form. It is supposed that water was delivered to earth after it cooled sufficiently, by some asteroid from outer space. \u0026quot;Understanding how water arrived on Earth is a key part of understanding how and when life evolved here as well. But we don\u0026rsquo;t even know how it where it came from.\u0026quot; (Sabrina Stierwalt, October 6, 2019 Scientific American)\nAll life contains DNA. The theory of evolution supposes that DNA formed by random processes in hot springs, and that the first DNA molecule somehow reproduced itself. No one has any theory for how DNA reproduces itself. It has never been observed and it is now acknowledged that DNA is incapable of reproducing itself, no matter how many nutrients are provided or how long is allowed. (Dennis Noble, Oxford University \u0026ndash; Music of Life lectures).\nEvolutionary Theory asserts and depends upon several theses:\n  DNA contains the instructions for making all the cells of an organism and is solely responsible for the organism produced.\n  Acquired attributes (the experiences during the life of the organism) do not affect the DNA and therefore cannot be transmitted through reproduction.\n  DNA changes through random mutations over long periods of time.\n  The death of organisms is required to allow more successful DNA to be reproduced more frequently than less successful DNA. This leads to evolutionary progress and the emergence of new species.\n  Modern Systems Biology has demonstrated that each of these pillars is false! (\u0026quot;What is life\u0026quot;-lecture to Karolinska Institute in Sweden: Denis Noble, May 2014). In 2006 Dawkins published the now famous \u0026quot;The Selfish Gene\u0026quot; which depends entirely upon Neo Darwinism and is the basis of much so-called scientific atheism. However, in the same year Denis Noble published \u0026quot;The Music of Life\u0026quot; in which he shows that Neo Darwinism has been disproved and cannot be the way that life has evolved.\nThe number of random combinations of DNA genes is 10^72403^. The number of atoms in the entire universe is about 10^80^. What is more, cells have been shown to employ multiple alternative mechanisms to buffer the effect of gene mutation. So gene mutation rarely results in changed behaviour at the cellular level, let alone the organism level.\nModern Systems Biology shows that complete organisms are required for their parts to function at all and have any biological purpose. Thus organisms replicate genes for their own purpose, rather than Genes using organisms to replicate themselves (as claimed by Dawkins). (See \u0026quot;Neo-Darwinism, the Modern Synthesis and selfish genes: are they of use in physiology?\u0026quot; Journal of Physiology. 2011 Mar 1; 589(Pt 5): 1007\u0026ndash;1015.)\nGoldfish from Carp DNA.\nComplex language amongst the simplest tribes.\nJordon Peterson\nDevelopments in Geology and Archaeology \u0026ndash; Flood evidence\nAnthony Flew denounced atheism.\nFlew stated that \u0026quot;the most impressive arguments for God\u0026rsquo;s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries\u0026quot; and that \u0026quot;the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than it was when I first met it\u0026quot;. The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, whichever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. Flew supported the idea of an Aristotelian God with \u0026quot;the characteristics of power and also intelligence\u0026quot;, stating that the [scientific] evidence for it was stronger than ever before.

T. Wright\nResearch Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity\n5.15 pm, October 26 2011\nThe four gospels stand magisterially at the head of the canon and the centre of early Christianity. They are remarkable documents. If they had been lost for centuries, and then dug up last year in the sands of Egypt, they would be hailed as among the most extraordinary writings from antiquity. Despite the occasional efforts to push them out of their central position and substitute other documents, whether actually existing (such as the wrongly named Gospel of Thomas) or reconstructed (such as the hypothetical document \u0026lsquo;Q\u0026rsquo;), the majority of scholars still believe, rightly in my view, that Matthew, Mark, Luke and John deserve their place. The fact that they are well known should not blind us to their remarkable blend of page-turning narrative, vivid portraiture (especially of their central figure), historical verisimilitude and sophisticated theology.\nAnd yet. Reversing what St Paul says about himself, the gospels, though well known at one level, are unknown at another. An oversimplification, of course; but I refer to the overall drift of gospel studies, and to the perception of the gospels in the church community to which biblical studies remains tangentially, and sometimes uncomfortably, related. Huge strides have been made, not least by my predecessor but one, Professor Richard Bauckham, both in his work on the wide intended readership of the gospels and in his award-winning book on the gospels and the eyewitnesses. If he is even half right ­\u0026ndash; and I think he is at least that \u0026ndash; then all kinds of assumptions, including some of those blessed things they used to call \u0026lsquo;the assured results of criticism\u0026rsquo;, will need to be torn up. But we need to go further still. Despite generations now of redaction criticism and narrative criticism, I am not convinced that the main message of the gospels has been grasped, let alone reflected in the methods employed for further study. And since I shall contend in this lecture that the four gospels stand at the centre of the missionary and hence theological life of the early church, a failure to understand their central thrust is most likely an index of a failure to grasp several other things as well about the life and work of the first Christians.\nI am not being alarmist. Fine work in many directions has been done on the gospels, a generation ago by another predecessor, Matthew Black of blessed memory. And of course Robin Wilson, of more recent memory, contributed much to our understanding of the early Christian hinterland within which the gospels and their early reception must be understood. But there comes a time in every discipline to take a deep breath, stand back, and say, \u0026lsquo;Well and good; but perhaps we\u0026rsquo;re still missing something.\u0026rsquo; That\u0026rsquo;s when we need, not simply more attention to detail, vital and central though that remains, but precisely imagination: a willingness to think beyond the fence, to ask questions hitherto screened out. And, to complete the list of recent predecessors, Markus Bockmuehl in his short stay here published a remarkable book, Seeing the Word, offering an eloquent and wide-ranging plea for just such an imaginative leap, a reassessment of the tasks and methods of the whole discipline. That is the kind of exercise which I want to share with you this afternoon, with due gratitude both for the invitation to occupy this chair and for the warm welcome I have received in St Mary\u0026rsquo;s College and in the wider University community. (It occurs to me that within this succession it has been over fifty years since someone was appointed whose name didn\u0026rsquo;t begin with either a B or a W. Make of that what you will.)\nMy remarks will fall into three sections. First, I shall propose a fresh thesis about the gospels, stressing the way in which they summoned their first readers to imagine a new state of affairs being launched into the world, a state of affairs for which the obvious shorthand was \u0026lsquo;the kingdom of God\u0026rsquo;. This might seem obvious, but the history of gospel scholarship has included many avoidance mechanisms, drawing attention away from the gospels' uncomfortable claim. Thus, in the second section, I want to pull back and survey the wider intellectual and cultural climate in which the discipline of \u0026lsquo;New Testament Studies\u0026rsquo; was born and nurtured, and suggest that the failure to grasp the central message of the gospels flows directly from various philosophical and cultural agendas which have dominated the discipline. This will send us back, third, to the gospels and the other New Testament writings, to look afresh at early Christian mission and the theology which grew up to support and explain it.\n1. How God Became King: The Story of the Gospels\nMy proposal about the gospels is that they all, in their rather different ways, tell the story of Jesus of Nazareth as the story of how God became king. They all, in other words, announce the launch of a \u0026lsquo;theocracy\u0026rsquo;. Research into the gospels has, by and large, managed to screen out this claim, which would have been obvious in the first century and which sustained the early church in its life and mission.\nThe word \u0026lsquo;theocracy\u0026rsquo;, of course, sends shivers down many spines today. In our current climate, with the uneasy stand-off between secularism and fundamentalism, the idea of \u0026lsquo;theocracy\u0026rsquo; sounds uncomfortably like a return to what people vaguely imagine as the situation of the Middle Ages, with popes, bishops and priests ordering everyone about \u0026ndash; or, indeed, to the forms of theocracy envisaged and sometimes even implemented in other religions today. (When I was lecturing in Ireland recently, someone asked me to comment on the fact that only two countries in the world have clergy sitting as of right in the upper chamber of Parliament: the UK on the one hand and Iran on the other.) Most modern westerners, not least in our great universities, react to this very strongly, upholding freedom both of action and of thought. Theocracy is what we thought we\u0026rsquo;d got rid of, not something we wanted to discover in some of the western tradition\u0026rsquo;s most cherished central texts.\nBut \u0026lsquo;theocracy\u0026rsquo;, in a sense yet to be defined, is of course what is meant by \u0026lsquo;the kingdom of God\u0026rsquo;, which the synoptic gospels highlight at the central motif of Jesus' public announcements and which the fourth gospel presupposes as his central theme (the first time we meet it in John it seems to be assumed that this is what Jesus is all about). We know from Josephus that the revolutionaries, in the last century before the disastrous Roman-Jewish war, took as their battle-cry the slogan \u0026lsquo;no king but God!\u0026rsquo; Presumably they thought they knew how God would exercise that kingly rule. Probably they imagined themselves having some role as divine agents. But we should not doubt that \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom\u0026rsquo; denoted the long-awaited rule of Israel\u0026rsquo;s God on earth as in heaven. The widespread assumption today that \u0026lsquo;the kingdom of God\u0026rsquo; denotes another realm altogether, for instance that of the \u0026lsquo;heaven\u0026rsquo; to which God\u0026rsquo;s people might hope to go after their death, was not on the first-century agenda. When Jesus spoke about God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom, and taught his followers to pray that it would arrive \u0026lsquo;on earth as in heaven\u0026rsquo;, he was right in the middle of first-century Jewish theocratic aspirations.\nSo when the gospels tell the story of Jesus as the story of \u0026lsquo;how God became king\u0026rsquo;, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t just an aspiration; it was an accomplishment. We can see this in three narratival strands which work together in all four gospels (though not, interestingly, in any of the non-canonical gnostic materials). As with this whole lecture, I here summarize and simplify a large mass of complex material.\nThe three strands in question come in addition to, not in competition with, the two more normally observed. First, the gospels are biographies: gone are the days when people could confidently deny that. Several studies have indicated the reverse: when placed alongside Greco-Roman bioi, the four canonical gospels clearly belong in something like the same genre. Second, the gospels reflect the life of the early church. How precisely they do that is another matter; that they do so is not in question. But the further three further dimensions have all too often been missing from the discussion. And these \u0026ndash; which all interlock \u0026ndash; explain what God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom is all about.\nThe first of these missing dimensions is that the four canonical gospels tell the story of Jesus as the continuation and climax of the ancient story of Israel. To say this is more than to say that the gospels portray Jesus as the fulfilment of ancient prophecy. That is obvious. It is the kind of fulfilment that matters here. In the wider Jewish world of the day, some people were telling the longer story of Israel was being told in search of an ending; the gospels are written in order to provide such an ending. What matters, though it cuts right against the grain of modern western thought, is the idea of narrative continuity. Not just \u0026lsquo;narrative\u0026rsquo; as such; that might lead simply to a repeated pattern, which we naturally find as well, for instance in the strong sense of a \u0026lsquo;new exodus\u0026rsquo;, the fresh and final repetition of ancient Israel\u0026rsquo;s greatest story. That is important, but it points beyond itself to the belief that all these repeated patterns were part of a larger sequence that was going somewhere. History might be in some sense cyclic, but the cycles contributed to a forward, linear movement. Thus the book we call Pseudo-Philo tells the ancient story of Israel and breaks off at the point where David is about to become king. Its recounting of the tales of the Judges seem to be designed as a model for militant messianic movements in the writer\u0026rsquo;s own day. The book of Wisdom recounts the story of the Exodus, not simply as a great historic moment in Israel\u0026rsquo;s ancient past, but as the model for the new and decisive act of judgment which Israel\u0026rsquo;s God is about to perform, condemning the wicked and vindicating his wise and righteous sufferers. At that level, despite the radical difference of genre, we find something similar in 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch, who look back to the horrible events of 586 BC as a kind of model for what they have experienced in AD 70, and retell the ancient story as a way of leading the eye up to the great messianic deliverance which is about to burst upon the world, with (in 4 Ezra\u0026rsquo;s vision) the messianic lion triumphing over the pagan eagle.\nAll of these, in their different ways, look back to the scriptures, and particularly the book of Daniel, with its intriguing combination of wisdom and apocalyptic. In fact, the storytelling we have just glanced at belongs within a much larger movement of thought in which Daniel 9 in particular became seminal. In Daniel 9 the prophet asks how long the exile is going to be: will it not, as Jeremiah prophesied, last for seventy years? Back comes the answer: not seventy years, but seventy times seven. There are important echoes here of the Jubilee theme from Leviticus 25, but for our purposes the point is that this predicted 490 years haunted the minds of devout Jews in the centuries immediately before and after the time of Jesus. There is plenty of evidence to indicate that people were calculating, as best they could, when that time would be up, and when the long-awaited deliverance from pagan domination would therefore occur. Their answers varied wildly. The Essenes, it appears, pinned their hopes on the climax coming around the time when Herod the Great died. Some Rabbis, however, did their sums quite differently (it all depends, of course, where you begin the sequence), so that when Akiba hailed Simeon benKosiba as Messiah in AD 132 some of his colleagues opposed him, not so much because ben Kosiba was not a suitable candidate but because, according to their calculations, the Son of David was not due for at least another century. All of this, interesting though it is, simply points to the widespread phenomenon which is, I suggest, the presupposition for the story the gospels tell in the way they tell it: that Israel\u0026rsquo;s history, under the guidance of a strange and often opaque divine providence, had not come to a standstill, but was moving forward towards its appointed goal. The story has many twists and turns, many flashbacks and indeed flash-forwards, advance hints of what is to come. But it is a single storyline, still awaiting its proper and fitting fulfilment.\nMy first point, then, is that all four gospels, in their different ways, are written so as to say that the story of the public career and fate of Jesus of Nazareth provides that proper and fitting, if highly surprising and subversive, fulfilment. Jesus is not, for the evangelists, simply the antitype of the various types such as Moses, or David, or the Passover lamb. He is the point at which the millennia-long narrative has reached its goal. Matthew makes the point, graphically, with his introductory genealogy. Mark does it with his opening quotations from Malachi and Isaiah; Luke, by telling the story of John the Baptist as a reprise of the story of Samuel. (They do it in many other ways, too, but these stand out.) John goes right back to the beginning, to the opening of Genesis, and structures his gospel so as to say that in Jesus not only the story of Israel but the story of all creation is reaching its decisive goal. And in all four gospels there are clear echoes and references back, in a variety of ways and contexts, to the various prophecies of Daniel, including those of chapter 9. It is in Daniel, of course, that we find the strongest statement of what the climax will be, when it comes: it will be the arrival of God\u0026rsquo;s own kingdom, his sovereign rule, trumping the rule of all pagan powers. And it is to Daniel that we should look to find the text which, according to Josephus (echoed at this point by Suetonius), most incited Jews to rebel against Rome: the text according to which a world ruler would, at that time, arise from Judaea (Jewish War 6.312-3; cf. Antiquities 10.267, where Josephus singles out Daniel as the only prophet who gave an exact chronology for when his predictions would come to pass). Josephus and Suetonius, of course, refer this to Vespasian, called back from the campaign against Jerusalem to become Emperor in Rome. The four gospels, clearly, have another candidate in mind. And, for that matter, a different sort of kingdom. But to that we shall return.\nThere is of course much more that could be said about the way in which the four gospels tell the story of Jesus as the climax of the continuous story of Israel, with the kingdom of God arriving at that climax. But I move rapidly to the second point, which is that the gospels tell this story as the story of Israel\u0026rsquo;s God. In the world of second-Temple Judaism there was a strong sense, not just that Israel\u0026rsquo;s fortunes needed to change, but that Israel\u0026rsquo;s God needed to come back to his people, to the temple. Ezekiel had described the divine glory leaving Jerusalem, and had prophesied that it would return to a rebuilt temple, but nobody ever said they\u0026rsquo;d seen it happen. There is no scene anywhere in the literature of the period to correspond to Exodus 40, where the divine glory fills the newly constructed tabernacle, or 1 Kings 8, where the same thing happens to Solomon\u0026rsquo;s Temple. There is no sudden appearance, as was granted to the prophet Isaiah. Plenty of texts say that it will happen (I think, obviously, of Isaiah 40 and 52, the two biblical passages, interestingly, where the word \u0026lsquo;gospel\u0026rsquo; occurs; of Zechariah and Malachi), but none indicate that it already has. And here the four evangelists are quite explicit. John is perhaps the most obvious: \u0026lsquo;the word became flesh,\u0026rsquo; he says, \u0026lsquo;and tabernacled, pitched his tent, in our midst; and we beheld his glory.\u0026rsquo; In case we missed the point, John rubs it in again and again. Mark, outwardly so different to John, hits the same note with those opening quotations from Isaiah and Malachi. Both passages concern the return of the divine glory, and the messenger who will prepare for it. Mark leaves us in no doubt that he thinks it has now happened, in and through Jesus. Matthew and Luke in their own ways get at the same point, Matthew not least with the Emmanuel promise and Luke not least through the terrifying scene in chapter 19 where Jesus, arriving in Jerusalem, tells the story about the king who comes back at last, and then announces Jerusalem\u0026rsquo;s imminent destruction because \u0026lsquo;you did not know the moment when God was visiting you\u0026rsquo; (to;n kairo;n th'~ ejpiskoph'~ sou).\nI hope you see that this puts the cat among several older critical pigeons. I grew up in a scholarly world where it was taken for granted that while John had a high, most probably Greek, Christology, thesynoptics had a low, most probably Jewish one. That only shows the extent to which people were asking the wrong question in the wrong framework. Once we think first-century Jewishly, a different picture emerges. To the old sneer, that Jesus talked about God but the early church talked about Jesus, we may reply that Jesus did indeed talk about God and God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom \u0026ndash; in order to explain what he himself was doing and would accomplish.\nIsrael\u0026rsquo;s stories normally confronted, not other Jews, but the might of pagan empire. If the gospels bring this story to a climax, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t surprises us to find \u0026ndash; this is my third main point \u0026ndash; that they are all written to tell the story of Jesus as the story of Israel, and of Israel\u0026rsquo;s God, reaching their proper climax, so as thereby to tell the story of how Israel\u0026rsquo;s God becomes king of the whole world. This is the clue to the mission, and the missionary theology, of the early church, to which I shall return.\nThink of the other narrative which had exploded around the time that Jesus was born. The intellectual coup d\u0026rsquo;état which Augustus accomplished through his court poets and historians was every bit as stunning as the political coup he achieved in the double civil war that followed the Julius Caesar\u0026rsquo;s assassination. Everybody in Rome knew that Augustus\u0026rsquo;s attaining of supreme and unchallengeable power meant the overthrow of a centuries-long tradition of fierce republicanism (Augustus, of course, insisted that he had merely restored the republic, but nobody was fooled). But for Livy to tell the history of Rome through the long years of the Republic and climaxing with the rule of Augustus, with whom he had a lasting friendship, was a remarkable achievement. Scholars differ on the extent to which Livy himself believed that the rule of Augustus was an unqualified good thing, and Tacitus records (Annals 4.34) that in one of the later, and sadly lost, books of his great work Livy felt able to praise the conspirators Brutus and Cassius. But he knew which side his bread was buttered on, as is evidenced for instance by his distorting of key political details to suit the new regime (e.g. 4.20, where Livy suggests that Cornelius Cossus was consul, not merely a military tribune, when celebrating his single-handed victory over an enemy commander four centuries earlier, thus supporting Augustus\u0026rsquo;s jealous retaining of military glory for himself in his own day).\nBut the greatest writer to tell the long story of Rome as a history leading the eye up to Augustus was Virgil. His early Eclogues refer to the turbulent events of the civil war, and include the mysterious fourth, hailing the birth of a child who will usher in the golden age. Virgil read the Georgics to Augustus in person after his victory at Actium in 31 BC; and he was regularly in the company of Augustus during the years in which he composed the Aeneid itself, the greatest poem of the period. Here there is, as is well known, a strong narrative teleology' (OCD 1606), invoking \u0026lsquo;Fate\u0026rsquo; as the force which will lead Aeneas to found Rome and Rome to produce, eventually, the wonderful new empire of Augustus. Already in the first Book the scene is set, with Jupiter himself prophesying to the world, back then in the time of Aeneas, that from his noble line there will be born \u0026lsquo;a Trojan Caesar, who shall extend his empire to the ocean, his glory to the stars\u0026rsquo; (1.286f.). His empire will be lavishly prosperous, and will bring peace to the world (1.289-95). Aeneas himself is seen as a type of the coming Augustus, an indication that here, too, typology can flourish within an overall grand narrative. I am not aware of any monarch before Augustus causing the story of his own accession to be told as the climax of a much longer narrative.\nWhen these three points are grasped together, we observe a remarkable phenomenon. There is no sign that the Romans are borrowing from Jewish tradition the idea of a thousand-year history climaxing in a surprising but victorious, prosperous and peace-bringing reign. Nor is there any suggestion that Matthew, Mark, Luke or John had read Livy or Virgil. But their story of Jesus as bringing the long history of Israel to an unexpected climax offered a remarkable parallel to the great Roman narrative, which Augustus and his successors were busily reinforcing in statues, coins and other symbolic artefacts. It was bound to be set on a collision course. The Jews, too, had cherished a prophecy about a coming king whose peaceful rule would extend from one sea to the other, from the River to the ends of the earth (Psalm 89; Zechariah 9). And the four evangelists declare that this king has arrived, and that his name is Jesus. It is not surprising \u0026ndash; to anticipate a later point \u0026ndash; that we find the early church accused, in northern Greece which was such key terrain for the early Empire, of behaving contrary to the dogmas of Caesar, and saying that there was \u0026lsquo;another king [basilea heteron], namely Jesus\u0026rsquo; (Acts 17.7).\nRome is, of course, scarcely mentioned in the four gospels. Yet, for those with first-century ears attuned, its presence is everywhere presupposed. John\u0026rsquo;s great climactic scene of Jesus and Pilate \u0026ndash; the kingdom of God against the kingdom of Caesar, challenging one another\u0026rsquo;s visions of kingdom, truth and power \u0026ndash; shows where, for him, the story was heading all along. Luke stages the birth of Jesus carefully in relation to the decree of Caesar Augustus, and his second volume ends with Paul in Rome announcing God as king and Jesus as lord, \u0026lsquo;openly and unhindered\u0026rsquo;. Matthew and Mark draw heavily on Daniel 7, the passage above all where God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom confronts and overthrows the kingdoms of the world, seen as a succession of four increasingly horrible monsters. There is no doubt, in the first century, that the fourth monster would have meant Rome. And if recent suggestions are right, Mark himself may have deliberately framed his gospel with strong hints that in Jesus an empire was coming to birth of a completely different character to that of Caesar. A current article (NTS 2010) contrasts the dove which descended on Jesus at his baptism with the Roman eagle, appearing as an omen to further the cause of Augustus or his successors. And an increasingly common interpretation of Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem is to see that event not only as the staged fulfilment of Zechariah 9 but also as a deliberate parody of the regular entry into Jerusalem of Pontius Pilate, on horseback surrounded by soldiers, coming from his quarters in Caesarea.\nWhether or not that is correct, we should certainly see the muttered remark of the centurion at the foot of the cross as vital. Mark hopes that his Roman readers will come to share this astonishing viewpoint. In a world where Caesar, unambiguously, was hailed as \u0026lsquo;son of God\u0026rsquo;, the centurion looks at the dead Jesus and transfers the title to him. It is the point where all the lines meet \u0026ndash; the lines that run from Abraham, David and the exile; the lines that run from 2 Samuel 7, Psalm 2 and Psalm 72; the lines that run from Exodus 40 to 1 Kings 8 and Ezekiel 43; and, above all, from Isaiah 40\u0026mdash;55 all the way into the mindset of Jesus himself and the interpretative work of the evangelists. The story told by all four gospels is the story of How God Became King: not by the usual means of military revolution, but by the inauguration of sovereignty during Jesus' public career, and the strange but decisive victory on the cross itself. All four report that Jesus was executed with the words \u0026lsquo;king of the Jews\u0026rsquo; over his head; and, as they all knew though many scholars have long forgotten, the ancient Jewish dream was that the king of the Jews would be king of the world. Of course: if Israel\u0026rsquo;s God was the creator of the world, one would expect nothing less. And what the four evangelists are asking their readers to do, as they ponder this strange multi-layered narrative, is precisely to imagine: to imagine that this, rather than something else, is what it would look like when God became king. Along with music and the visual arts, narrative is a primary human means of stimulating the imagination. And this is precisely, I suggest, what the four gospels are aiming to do.\nThese are the themes which I see prominently in the gospels but not so prominently in contemporary scholarship. Indeed, much of the effort expended on the gospels over the last hundred years and more has been directed, not towards grappling with these issues, but precisely towards holding them at bay. Narrative and imagination have been at a discount; the mechanical study of dismembered fragments has been the rule. Most of the much-vaunted \u0026lsquo;methods\u0026rsquo; proposed in gospel scholarship have been generated from within a world where all that I have just said has been ignored. Such methods are not neutral; they reflect the underlying assumptions of their makers, and I am suggesting that those underlying assumptions were deeply flawed. But why should this have been so? To try to understand that I turn to the second main section of my lecture.\n2. Avoiding the Kingdom: The Story of Biblical Scholarship\nIf we are to engage with our predecessors as historical critics of the New Testament we must contextualize them in the climate of thought in which they lived. An obvious example, not least in connection with dismembered fragments, is the great German Rudolf Bultmann. He was himself keenly aware of his own presuppositions, though many of his followers, not least in the UK and America, treated his work as the objective results of neutral scholarship. Anything but: he was writing his major work on the gospels at a time when, after the First World War and the demise of the Kaiser and other \u0026lsquo;great men\u0026rsquo;, Germany was trying to become simply a \u0026lsquo;community\u0026rsquo;, a Gemeinde, in the Weimar Republic. What did Bultmann do? He wrote about the gospels as the collections of stories which die Gemeinde, the \u0026lsquo;community\u0026rsquo;, told amongst themselves to sustain their present faith, not at all intending reference to a recently departed \u0026lsquo;great man\u0026rsquo;, except for the sheer fact of his crucifixion. No thought of \u0026lsquo;kingdom\u0026rsquo; there in any sense that a first-century Jew might recognise.\nBut that observation is simply the tip of the iceberg. So, too, is the necessary warning issued a generation ago by Hans Frei, that for much of the last two centuries narrative itself has been \u0026lsquo;eclipsed\u0026rsquo; in biblical scholarship, which had regarded stories as secondary and looked instead for nuggets of doctrinal and ethical teaching. (We might compare the recent anti-Bible put out by the philosopher A. C. Grayling, which despite its attempt to parody the actual Bible, with its chapter-headings and its \u0026lsquo;verses\u0026rsquo;, consists of no narrative at all, but only wise sayings and advice.) But, again, one has to ask why. This is a question which demands a multi-volume answer. All I can do here is to put two or three items on the table for further discussion. I shall once again oversimplify. My aim is to stimulate the disciplined imagination.\nFirst, ever since the Renaissance the implicit narrative of western culture has included a fracture. There is the good early period; then there is the bad or boring middle period; then there is the sudden reawakening, the shining of a great light, in which we retrieve the good early period \u0026ndash; or some of it, anyway \u0026ndash; in a newly formed culture or worldview. Thus the Renaissance itself, fed up with what was seen as the stodgy and unimaginative categories of the late Middle Ages, saw itself as breaking with the immediate past and retrieving an earlier golden age. The Reformation, in its turn, went back not (of course) to the Renaissance\u0026rsquo;s pagan sources but to the Bible and the early fathers, though largely agreeing about the dark middle period from which one needed a clean break. The Enlightenment, some of whose seeds were sown in both the Renaissance and the Reformation, constantly tends to portray everything before it as ignorant superstition, hailing modern science and technology as the signs of the brave new world which enable us to draw an even thicker line between ourselves and our predecessors, retrieving only those bits and pieces of earlier wisdom which may commend themselves from time to time.\nOne way or another, though, all these great movements have contained an implicit (and often explicit) narrative in which what one precisely does not want is continuity. Within Protestantism in particular \u0026ndash; and until fairly recently most of the running in biblical scholarship was made by Protestants of one stripe or another \u0026ndash; the sense of a major break in the narrative is deeply important. Anything else might signal, at least by implication, that the Catholics had been right all along, even though ostensibly the story being told would have been about the first century rather than the sixteenth. There has, then, been deep visceral resistance to any idea of a continuous narrative, and this itself has greatly impeded a recognition of what the gospels were actually doing.\nSecond, however, the movement of thought from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment can be characterized especially by the major revival of Epicureanism. Ever since Poggio Bracciolini rediscovered Lucretius\u0026rsquo;s great poem De Rerum Natura in an obscure European monastery in 1417 \u0026ndash; exactly a century before Luther\u0026rsquo;s supposed rediscovery of Paul\u0026rsquo;s theology led him to nail his thesis to the Wittenberg door \u0026ndash; the great alternative philosophy of the first century (alternative, that is, to the otherwise dominant Stoicism) had been making its way in European circles (see now Stephen Greenblatt, The Swerve: How the Renaissance Began [London: The Bodley Head, 2011]). It came to its full flowering with the thinkers of the Enlightenment, taking in such seminal figures as Giordani Bruno, Montaigne, Galileo, Bacon, Hobbes, Newton, Hume and, not least, Thomas Jefferson, who famously proclaimed \u0026lsquo;I am an Epicurean\u0026rsquo;. (That claim has to be taken seriously, despite Jefferson\u0026rsquo;s attempts to have his cake and eat it by also noting his admiration for Epictetus, a first-century Stoic, and of course for Jesus himself; the latter two being subject to Jefferson\u0026rsquo;s own rather heavy-handed attempts to decontextualize them and present the cleaned-up results in a way that sustained his other agendas rather than undermining them, as left to themselves they might have done.) The point is that in Epicurean philosophy, over against the confused and frightening paganism of the ancient world and the confused and frightening religion of the middle ages, the gods are removed far away, off to a distant heaven from which they don\u0026rsquo;t even bother to get involved in the affairs of the present world. The world itself, according to the first-century atomism of Lucretius, consists of, well, atoms, and the objects made up of them, moving under their own steam, without divine intervention, developing and transforming themselves according to their own energy, their innate \u0026lsquo;swerve\u0026rsquo; (clinamen, a crucial Epicurean term), and the survival of the fittest.Darwinism before Darwin. Human society, likewise, should be able to order itself from within, needing no divine intervention whether through kings or priests or anybody else. The modern movement of liberal democracy is thus the twin sister of modern atheistic science, sharing Lucretius as the primary ancestor and the Enlightenment philosophers as immediate parents. Biblical scholarship as we know it today was born in a world where the gods had been banished far away, a world in which humans and their societies moved under their own steam.\nThe majority of westerners today simply do not realise either that they are Epicureans by default or that Epicureanism was always only one philosophy among others. As a young theologian I was taught that the Enlightenment had opened up a new saeculum (as indeed the American dollar bill declares to this day), and that we could not think of challenging it. That, of course, was the shrill protest that presaged the arrival of postmodernity, when the old Enlightenment certainties were shaken to the core. But people usually do not realise that the Epicurean stance of separating God or the gods from the world was always simply one option; that it was always an unstable option (since the gods always tended to sneak back in by other means, as in the Romantic movement\u0026rsquo;s pantheistic answer to Enlightenment rationalism), that it was always a costly option, easier to embrace if you were rich and healthy enough to enjoy the Epicurean lifestyle. But the most important point is that this unstable and costly option was always going to be a very bad framework for understanding the Jewish traditions, especially the New Testament itself.\nNow of course, as a historian I believe that people with all kinds of different worldviews can and should study the evidence of the past and offer what interpretations they can of it, and particularly \u0026ndash; the heart of good history \u0026ndash; what made people tick. As the great contemporary historian Asa Briggs has written in his recent account of his time at Bletchley Park, what made young historians such goodcodebreakers is that they were \u0026lsquo;well read, drawn to lateral thinking, and taught to get inside the mind of people totally different from themselves\u0026rsquo; (Secret Days p 78). But there\u0026rsquo;s the point. To use the anthropologist\u0026rsquo;s jargon, historians of whatever background and context ought to have a stab at offering an etic account of the societies they are studying, that is, an outsider\u0026rsquo;s fair analysis of the phenomena before them. But, as with anthropology, so with history, the insidious pressure is there to provide what purports to be an emic account \u0026ndash; an account of how the people themselves actually thought \u0026ndash; but which is in fact the etic one in disguise. And when, in the case of Enlightenment historiography, the etic account was offered from within Epicurean principles, the chance of getting anywhere near the emicaccount that first-century Jews (including the early Christians) might have offered was severely reduced. In fact, within the Epicurean worldview Judaism was reduced, first, to being a \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; (the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; itself having been already severely redefined to reflect Epicurean principles, now meaning \u0026lsquo;that which humans do with their solitude\u0026rsquo;), and then to being the wrong sort of religion (since it persisted, perversely from the Epicurean point of view, in believing that the real world of creation, and human actions within it, actually mattered as part of the whole). Those who embraced the Enlightenment but sought still to be good Christians thus portrayed themselves in a different light. Martin Luther\u0026rsquo;s Protestantism, in which Paul rose and smote the wicked Judaizers, came to birth in a new form, as Christianity had to become unJewish in order to hold up its head in European culture. I\u0026rsquo;m talking here about the 1830s, not yet the 1930s. Religion and ordinary life had to be kept as far apart as possible. The French went all the way with the Enlightenment agenda, and tried to wipe out religion entirely \u0026ndash; as they are still trying to do, with the banning of Muslim headscarves. The Americans compromised, and insisted on a rigid separation of church and state: you could still be a Christian, but you\u0026rsquo;d better not bring it into public life. The English, as usual, looked this way and that, took a pragmatic approach, and muddled along. As a newcomer, I had better not try to describe what happened in Scotland, though the simultaneous influence of John Knox and David Hume offers an interesting legacy. As for Ireland, I am reminded of the remark of my good friend the Irish American biblical scholar Dominic Crossan, who said that the Irish never really got the Enlightenment, but they got the British instead, which they found most enlightening in other ways. But my point is this: Epicureanism, and its social and political outworkings, may or may not be the best way for us today to organise our world. I would argue not, but that\u0026rsquo;s not the point. But it is certainly not a good framework for us to understand the world of the early Christians.\nThe discipline has reflected this, on both sides of various great debates. The fateful Enlightenment split between the gods and the world has generated a new meaning for words like \u0026lsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;supernatural\u0026rsquo;. It is now widely believed by would-be Christian apologists that part of the task is to defend something called \u0026lsquo;the supernatural\u0026rsquo;, in which a normally distant divinity invades the \u0026lsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; world to perform \u0026lsquo;miracles\u0026rsquo; or even, in the Christian story, to become human. But this merely reinscribes and perpetuates the Epicureanism which still serves as the framework for the discussion. Thus, in the study of the gospels, so-called \u0026lsquo;liberals\u0026rsquo; have done their best to offer would-be historical accounts in which Jesus was \u0026lsquo;really\u0026rsquo; a Jewish revolutionary or teacher or apocalyptic prophet (the notion of \u0026lsquo;apocalyptic\u0026rsquo; itself, by the way, has suffered radically through this process, but that\u0026rsquo;s another story), while the so-called \u0026lsquo;conservatives\u0026rsquo; have done their best to offer a historical account in which Jesus really was a \u0026lsquo;supernatural\u0026rsquo; being who really did do miracles and rise from the dead. And since in my own work I have done my best to counter some of the revisionist proposals it might be easy to suppose I was simply taking the latter path. Rather, I want to insist that to understand the first Christians we must understand the radical difference between the ancient Jewish worldview and the ancient Epicurean worldview (remembering not least that one of the sharpest insults a Rabbi could offer to heretics was to call them apikorsim, Epicureans). In the ancient Jewish worldview, the one God was not removed from the world, but was mysteriously present and active within it, at least in theory, so that if he remained absent, as in the second-Temple period, there was precisely a sense of that absence. And the modes of his presence and activity were concentrated on the major Jewish symbols: Temple, Torah, land, family, and not least the great narrative which was continuing and would be fulfilled even though it might have seemed for the moment, like a submerged stream, to be running underground. This was the air Jesus and his first followers breathed. And the task of describing, from an emic viewpoint, the mindset and motivation of the earliest Christians is thus one for which the Epicurean worldview is singularly badly suited. And to the extent that the movement of nineteenth-century biblical scholarship was done from within that Enlightenment framework, in its various forms owing much to Kant, Hegel and later Feuerbach, it was bound to misunderstand and misrepresent what the earliest Christians were about. And since some of the nineteenth-century proposals are still alive and well, kept alive by the sheer inertia of a complex discipline long after their sell-by date, we still find ourselves facing categories like \u0026lsquo;Jewish Christian\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Gentile Christian\u0026rsquo;, like \u0026lsquo;Early Catholicism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;apocalyptic\u0026rsquo;, which actually demand such radical overhaul that it might be better to draw our own heavy line across the falseHeilsgeschichte of triumphalist scholarship, and try to start again.\nThere is another element to all this which I just mention before turning to my final point about the cultural context of modern biblical scholarship. Much of this work has been done within the Lutheran tradition. But, for all its strengths, the Lutheran world has long embraced a \u0026lsquo;two kingdoms\u0026rsquo; theology in which God and Caesar simply won\u0026rsquo;t mix. When coupled with the Enlightenment\u0026rsquo;s Epicureanism, this has produced several generations of scholarship in which, for instance, it is off limits to imagine that Paul might have regarded Jesus as the Messiah, with all the overtones of world sovereignty that word carried. The general scholarly view has colluded with the general popular view of western Christianity, that the purpose of the whole thing is to go to heaven when you die rather than discerning, \u0026lsquo;imagining\u0026rsquo; shall we say, the kingdom of God on earth as in heaven and working for that end. Of course, liberation theology and its various exegetical offshoots have offered a rival view. But, as with the so-called \u0026lsquo;conservative\u0026rsquo; reaction, this has often simply maintained the split world of the Enlightenment, proposing (for instance) that Paul was \u0026lsquo;really\u0026rsquo; a politician and therefore not really a theologian after all. Similar things might be said about some of the work, important in its own way, that has gone under the umbrella of \u0026lsquo;sociology\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;anthropology\u0026rsquo;. From the post-Enlightenment standpoint, this appears to be on the \u0026lsquo;worldly\u0026rsquo; side of the divide while God, or the gods, remain elsewhere. From the Jewish and early Christian perspective, such a division already gives in to one version of the paganism which both were determined to resist.\nOne final element of our modern world which has militated against imagining the kingdom in our reading of the gospels, and much else besides, is the triumph of left-brain thinking over right-brain thinking. This has been massively and memorably set out by Iain McGilchrist in his breathtaking book The Master and his Emissary. McGilchrist has of course inevitably been criticized from within his own field; he is both a brain scientist and a literary critic, and as such has a unique perspective on the history of ideas, though some of his fellow scientists insist that the left/right distinction is not nearly so hard and fast as his book (despite frequent disclaimers and modifications) might indicate. But, whatever caveats may be needed at the level of the study of the physical brain, as I read his account of the way in which, in the last three centuries, the apparently left-brain activities of analysing, calculating and organising have steadily taken charge of our world, squeezing out the apparently right-brain activities of imagination, story-telling, and intuitive thinking, I find it uncannily accurate as a description of our world in general and of biblical scholarship in particular.\nMcGilchrist argues on the basis of brain science itself, in fact, that our brains are designed to work in a two-way movement: from the right brain, with its initial intuitions, metaphors and imagination, to the left brain which works on the detail, and back to the right brain again to engage with the real world. The right brain is thus the \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo;, and the left brain the \u0026lsquo;emissary\u0026rsquo;, working at its best within the framework given by the right and intending to pass the results back across. But, as with some observable pathologies (not least schizophrenia), the left brain has taken over, and we live (says McGilchrist) in a world in which the master has been betrayed.\nMcGilchrist does not refer to the world of biblical scholarship, but the following paragraph jumped out at me as a pretty accurate summary of how the discipline has often gone:\n\u0026lsquo;We could expect\u0026rsquo; (he writes) \u0026lsquo;that there would be a loss of the broader picture, and a substitution of a more narrowly focussed, restricted, but detailed, view of the world, making it perhaps difficult to maintain a coherent overview . . . This in turn would promote the substitution of information, and information gathering, for knowledge, which comes through experience . . . One would expect the left hemisphere to keep doing refining experiments on detail, at which it is exceedingly proficient, but to be correspondingly blind to what is not clear or certain, or cannot be brought into focus right in the middle of the visual field. In fact one would expect a sort of dismissive attitude to anything outside of its limited focus, because the right hemisphere\u0026rsquo;s take on the whole picture would simply not be available to it.\u0026rsquo; (428f.)\nI recognise this picture. Having worked for the Church of England for nearly twenty years, I recognise it as an account of what has happened, damagingly, to our institutions. Whether it has happened in the universities too, in the years I have been absent, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly say. My point is that it has manifestly happened in biblical studies, and especially in New Testament studies, and not least in the study of the gospels. All too often the microscopic analysis of details, vital though it is in its place, has been made to seem an end in itself. \u0026lsquo;Objective facts\u0026rsquo; are all the rage, and whether you\u0026rsquo;re a left-wing hunter of objectivity, determined to disprove the gospels, or a right-wing hunter of objectivity, determined to show that they are after all \u0026lsquo;factual\u0026rsquo;, you may still be missing the point and losing the plot. Facts are left-brain business; vital in their place, but only part of the whole. Thus, on the one hand, those who presently trumpet the need for a purely and exclusively \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; study of the Bible are simply following through the anti-metaphorical agenda of the French Revolution (McGilchrist 347); while those who respond with an attempted rationalistic proof of, say, Jesus' divinity are often themselves remaining within the same sterile antithesis. Like Marxism and capitalism, secularism and fundamentalism are simply the left and right boots of Enlightenment Epicureanism. Only when the detailed left-brain analysis can be relocated as the emissary to the right-wing intuition, with its rich world of metaphor, narrative and above all imagination, can the discipline become healthy again.\nThe good news is that the gospels themselves resist the destructive, atomising, Epicurean left-brain analysis. They go on telling the story of How God Became King, and demanding that serious readers learn to imagine a world in which that might be the case, a world reshaped around their account of Jesus. Perhaps, after all, biblical studies might be one place where the return of the Master, a theme indeed made famous by some of Jesus' own stories, might begin to take place. This is a challenge, particularly, for those engaged in doctoral studies. It is much easier to do a purely left-brain doctorate, and there is still plenty of room for that. But we also need, and quite urgently, a new generation who won\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to see the bigger picture and, without in the least going slack on the necessary left-brain analytic and philological exactitude, come back and articulate a new, freshly imagined vision of the kingdom of God.\n3. Early Christian Mission and Theology\nAll this leads to my concluding remarks on early Christian mission and theology. For over a century now it has been commonplace within the discipline called New Testament Studies to assume that the early church had to jettison its Jewishness in order to be relevant to the Gentile world into which it quickly went. Thus it has been assumed, again, that Paul had to downplay the idea of Jesus as Israel\u0026rsquo;s Messiah and to switch, instead, to the more readily available category of the kuvrio~, the \u0026lsquo;Lord\u0026rsquo;. But this proposal, hugely influential though it has been, simply fails to imagine what \u0026lsquo;the kingdom of God\u0026rsquo; meant to the early Christians, Paul included (he doesn\u0026rsquo;t use the phrase that often, but when he does we can see that it remains at the centre of his worldview). Paul, in fact, held firmly to the ancient Jewish belief, rooted in the Psalms, in Isaiah and in Daniel, that a world ruler would indeed arise from Judaea, that Israel\u0026rsquo;s God would thereby return to dwell amongst and within his people, and that through this means the long-awaited new creation of peace and justice would be inaugurated for the whole world. All of that standard Jewish expectation came to fresh flowering in Paul\u0026rsquo;s work. Of course, the communities which Paul founded were determinedly non-ethnic in their basis. But this was not because Paul had as it were gone soft on the essential Jewishness of his mission, or because there was something wrong (as Epicureans imagine) with Judaism, but because he believed that it was precisely part of the age-old divine plan that when God did for Israel what he was going to do for Israel then the nations would be brought under the healing, saving rule of this one God. Paul\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;gospel\u0026rsquo;, his eujaggevlion, was thus much closer in meaning to the various eujaggevlia of Caesar than most of modern scholarship has imagined. It was, as Acts 17 (already quoted) indicates, the royal announcement, right under Caesar\u0026rsquo;s nose, that there was \u0026lsquo;another king, namely Jesus\u0026rsquo;. And Paul believed that this royal announcement, like that of Caesar, was not a take-it-or-leave-it affair. It was a powerful summons through which the living God worked by his Spirit in hearts and minds, to transform human character and motivation, producing the tell-tale signs of faith, hope and love which Paul regarded as the biblically prophesied marks of God\u0026rsquo;s true people.\nThe communities which sprang into surprised existence as Paul went around making this royal announcement were remarkably devoid of an obvious symbolic world. They were precisely not defined by the worldview-symbols of Judaism \u0026ndash; Temple, Torah observance and so on. They certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t adopt the symbols of the surrounding pagan culture. How could this new community, this new sort of community, retain what for Paul was its vital centre, namely its strong unity across traditional social divisions, and its strong holiness in matters of our old friends, money, sex and power? For Paul the answer was simple. The community needed to understand what it was that had happened in Jesus the Messiah, and in particular who the God was into whose new world they had been brought. What we see in Paul is thus properly characterized as the birth of the discipline which later came to be called Christian theology, by which I mean the prayerful and scripture-based reflection, from within the common life of the otherwise disparate body called the church, on who exactly the one God was and what his action in Jesus and by the Spirit was to mean. Early Christian theology was not an exercise undertaken for the sake of speculative system-building. It was load-bearing. If the unity and holiness of the early church were the central symbols of the movement, they could only be held in place if a vigorous theology was there to stabilize them in the winds and storms of the first century. Theology, in this sense, serves ecclesiology and thus the kingdom-based mission. Actually, I have come to worry about a post-Enlightenment theology that doesn\u0026rsquo;t do this, that thinks the point is simply to \u0026lsquo;prove\u0026rsquo; the divinity of Jesus, or his resurrection, or the saving nature of his death in themselves, thereby demonstrating fidelity to the Creeds or some other regula fidei. In the gospels themselves it isn\u0026rsquo;t like this. All these things matter, but they matter because this is how God is becoming king. To prove the great Creeds true, and to affirm them as such, can sadly be a diversionary exercise, designed to avoid the real challenge of the first-century gospel, the challenge of God\u0026rsquo;s becoming king in and through Jesus.\nThis challenge, of course, required imagination: not the undisciplined fantasy of which left-brain thinking often accuses right-brain thinking, but the imaginative leap from the worldviews of paganism, with their many gods who might either be far removed, as in Epicureanism, or rolled into one and close at hand, as in Stoicism \u0026ndash; or indeed from the worldviews of ancient Judaism, with their fierce concentration on the symbols of land, nation, temple and Torah. But the leap was not made into the unknown. The imaginative leap required was made on the basis of Jesus, Jesus the crucified and risen Jewish Messiah, Jesus the one in and through whom Israel\u0026rsquo;s God had at last returned in person to rescue his people and the world. And to sustain precisely that leap, the early Christians told and retold, and eventually wrote down, the story of Jesus.\nThe four gospels, then, to return to our starting point, are thus appropriately named \u0026lsquo;gospel\u0026rsquo;, in line both with Isaiah 40 and 52 and with the contemporary pagan usage. They themselves, in telling the story of how God became king in and through Jesus, invite their readers to the imaginative leap of saying, \u0026lsquo;Suppose this is how God has done it? Suppose the world\u0026rsquo;s way of empire is all wrong? Suppose there\u0026rsquo;s a different way, and suppose that Jesus, in his life, death and resurrection, has brought it about?\u0026rsquo; And the gospels themselves, of course, contain stories at a second level, stories purportedly told by Jesus himself, which were themselves, in their day, designed to break open the worldview of their hearers and to initiate a massive imaginative leap to which Jesus gave the name \u0026lsquo;faith\u0026rsquo;. The gospels invite their readers, in other words, to a multiple exercise, both of imagining what it might have been like to make that leap in the first century (both for Jesus' hearers and then, at a second stage, for their own readers) and, as a further stage again, of imagining what it might be like to do so today. For too long gospel study has been dominated by the attempt to make the gospels reflect, simply, the faith-world of the early church. Why, after all, the radical critics used to say, would the early Christians have been particularly interested in miscellaneous stories of what Jesus actually said or did, when all that really mattered was his saving death, making the gospels simply \u0026lsquo;passion narratives with extended introductions\u0026rsquo;? The conservative response has been that early converts would naturally want to know more about this Jesus in whom they had come to place their faith. But this stand-off, on both sides, has usually failed to reflect the larger question: that the gospels tell the story of Jesus not out of mere historical anecdotage or faith-projection, but because this is how Jesus launched the kingdom of God, which he then accomplished in his death and resurrection. Even to hold this possibility in one\u0026rsquo;s head requires, in today\u0026rsquo;s western church, whether radical or conservative, no less than in the non-Christian world, a huge effort of the imagination.\nThis imagination, like all good right-brain activity, must then be firmly and thoroughly worked through the left brain, disciplined by the rigorous historical and textual analysis for which the discipline of biblical studies has rightly become famous. But, by itself, the left brain will produce, and has often produced, a discipline full of facts but without meaning, high on analysis and low on reconstruction, good at categories and weak on the kingdom. One of the reasons I was excited to be invited to come to St Andrews is because this is already one of the very few places in the world where the imagination is taken seriously as part of the whole theological discipline. I hope and trust and pray that we will be able to work together at the challenging but richly rewarding tasks of imagining the kingdom in such a way that will simultaneously advance the academic understanding of our extraordinary primary texts and enrich the mission and theology of tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s church. It is just as difficult today as it was in the first century to imagine what the kingdom of God might look like. Rigorous historical study of the gospels and the other early Christian writings has a proper role to play in fuelling, sustaining and directing that imagination, and in helping to translate it into reality.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"757a04cee229dd86f128426e046babf2","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/nt-wright/imagining-the-kingdom/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/nt-wright/imagining-the-kingdom/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Imagining the Kingdom: Mission and Theology in Early Christianity\nUniversity of St Andrews\nSt Mary\u0026rsquo;s College (Faculty of Divinity)\nInaugural Lecture\nby the Right Reverend Professor N.

(John 6:53) Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (Rom 8:1) \u0026quot;the glorious riches of this Gospel is Christ in you, the hope of glory.\u0026quot; (Col 1:27) ... to be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own ... but that which is through faith in Christ (Phil 3:9)  The point is that Jesus Himself is our righteousness and our salvation. Forgiveness and salvation was not something Jesus bought for us which we then go and pick up, or \u0026quot;sign-up\u0026quot; for. It was not merely some legal deal done with God. We do not simply need to \u0026quot;appropriate\u0026quot; (take something for one's own use) salvation; Jesus is not Santa Christ, leaving gifts for us to discover in His absence! No, we need to eat and drink Jesus, we need to become one with Him, He in us and we in Him. Our salvation consists of sharing in Jesus' relationship to the Father:  And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus (Eph 2:6) It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become ... our righteousness, holiness and redemption. (1 Cor 1:30)  Our righteousness consists in being in Christ, not just believing in Him. Indeed, Jesus Himself pioneered that union:  The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. (John 1:14) \u0026quot;I and the Father are one.\u0026rdquo; (John 10:30)  Jesus, being a true flesh-and-blood man yet living in union with the Father, pioneered the way for us to live in our flesh-and-blood and yet be in union with Him, sharing His union with the Father:  God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship (literally: communion) with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. (1 Cor 1:9)  It is in our communion and co-union with Jesus that we find our salvation and righteousness:  For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. (Col 3:3-4)  Jesus spoke of going away and sending the Spirit, but despite the fact that he said \u0026ldquo;*[I]{.ul} *will come to you (Jn 14:18) we tend to think that the Holy Spirit is the sole means by which we are united with God. But this is not the teaching of the NT. Rather it is through the Holy Spirit that Christ dwells in us, and we in Him. Thus the Holy Spirit is sometimes called the Spirit of Christ.  Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, \u0026ldquo;Abba, Father.\u0026quot; (Galatians 4:6)\n We are not the body of the Spirit but the body of Christ. The Spirit's purpose is to reveal and make real to us our union with Christ. That this union is not just a union of purpose and belief, but deeply personal and all-embracing is demonstrated by the language Paul uses in describing it. In Eph 5:29-32 he likens it to marriage where two become one flesh. Then in 1Cor 6:15-17 he makes the explicit comparison with sexual union. The point being that bodily union with a prostitute violates our union with Christ precisely because our union with Christ includes our bodies and makes our bodies the temple of the Holy Spirit. Although we often talk about being saved by faith, it is not really faith that saves, but Christ who saves us, and it is by faith that we become one with Him and are thereby saved:  That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you \u0026hellip; may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. (Eph 3:17-19)  Union with Christ is not a pursuit, achieved through emulating Christ's holy life. It is not the reward and end of sanctification. Rather, it is the starting point and motivation for sanctification: Christ and the believer have the same life. They are not separate persons linked together by some temporary bond of friendship\u0026mdash;they are united by a tie as close and indissoluble as if the same blood ran in their veins.

It is a wonderful mystery that must be experienced through practice. In prayer we lift our hearts to God and enter most deeply into the relationship of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. In answer to prayer, God moves mountains.\nThe words on these pages are not prayers in themselves. The words become prayer only when they have sunk into the deepest places of our hearts and rise up again as our own united with our faith.\nUse Morning Prayer every day for seven days. Try to stick to the same time each day if you can. There is a very short guide for Prayer Before Bed as well which simply uses the same Psalm as morning prayer. Try to use both forms of prayer each day.\nPreparation for prayer begins with recognition that God is here with us and we become more deeply aware of His presence as we still our minds with the prayer of stillness:\n Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, thank you for your mercy to me.\n \u0026lsquo;Lord\u0026rsquo; because Jesus is God.\n\u0026lsquo;Christ\u0026rsquo; which means \u0026lsquo;anointed one\u0026rsquo; because Jesus was anointed with the Holy Spirit as King.\n\u0026lsquo;Son of God\u0026rsquo; meaning Jesus is the Son in the Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The Son who has always existed with God the Father and the Spirit and through whom all things were created.\n\u0026lsquo;thank you for your mercy\u0026rsquo; because Jesus came and rescued us and gave us what we didn\u0026rsquo;t deserve, eternal life in Him. So we begin with thanks for His goodness to us.\nTo use this prayer of stillness start by praying the words out loud, taking a breath half way through after \u0026lsquo;Son of God\u0026rsquo;. Focus your mind on Jesus as you repeat the words. To begin with, lots of thoughts will come into your mind about all kinds of things. Try not to follow these thoughts. Instead, keep pulling your mind back to the words of the prayer and to Jesus. Gradually your mind will become quieter and you can start to pray the prayer silently in your mind. It helps to match the words to your breathing so that you breathe in for \u0026lsquo;Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God\u0026rsquo; and breathe out for \u0026lsquo;thank you for your mercy\u0026rsquo;. When you feel peaceful and you feel the love of Jesus filling your heart you are ready to begin praising God.\nPraise follows thanksgiving. We use the words from the one of the Apostle Paul\u0026rsquo;s letters which the first Christians would have prayed or sung to worship Jesus together. The song of praise is followed by the short prayer giving glory to the Holy Trinity \u0026lsquo;Glory to the Father\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;. Try speaking both of these out loud or chanting or singing them. It makes a powerful difference to how the words effect your heart.\nNext we focus on the Bible, the Word of God. Because it is inspired by God it is not only the words of the human writers but, through the power of the Holy Spirit, the Bible becomes God\u0026rsquo;s words to us leading us to Himself, the source of all life; to Jesus who is The Word of God, The Way, The Truth and The Life.\nThe Psalms were the prayers and songs of the Jewish people. As a Jew, Jesus himself would have learned and recited the Psalms. Right from the start Christians have taken the Psalms and reinterpreted them in the light of Jesus and used them to worship and pray to Him as our Lord and King. Here there are seven Psalms, one for each day, which we can pray, chant or sing to lift our hearts to God. If you have time, it is helpful to pray through the Psalm slowly by responding to and expanding on each line with your own words.\nThe Psalm is followed by a reading from the Old or New Testament. It is good to read the short passage for the day several times until it becomes familiar. Ask the Holy Spirit to speak to you through it and bring you closer to Jesus.\nWhen we are ready to respond in our hearts to the reading there is a written response to focus our minds and hearts on Jesus. It also includes a time of silence to allow the Holy Spirit to work in our heart.\nWhen we feel the Holy Spirit drawing us to make requests of the Father we can begin with The Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer, saying the words slowly, pausing between each line to allow specific prayers to rise from our hearts.\nThe Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer is followed by a time of intercession, praying in our own words for specific people and things. At this point you should expect the Holy Spirit to continue to guide you as you pray. You may also find that your heart fills with a deep love for the people you are praying for. This is one of the sweetest experiences of the love of God flowing through you which is matched only by the sense of God\u0026rsquo;s love felt as you serve people face to face with healing, encouragement, generosity, hospitality and comfort.\nUsing a litany at this point can help us keep concentration and focus on one type of need at a time. It also helps us make sure to cover a wide range of things in our prayers. But only use it if you find it helpful.\nWhen we are ready to finish, we pray the closing prayer. Pray it out loud or silently, very slowly, pausing between each line to allow the words to become a reality in your heart.\nNow the conclusion closes the time of prayer and reminds us of our dependency on God and His joy at blessing us as His beloved children.\nMorning Prayer: weekly cycle Preparation Recognition God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts,\nWho brings us home to our loving Father.\nThe Spirit of God is here in power,\nJesus our Saviour is with us now and forever.\nStillness Repeat the following sentence silently and continuously until your mind is still and your heart alive to the Spirit.\nLord Jesus Christ, Son of God, thank you for your mercy to me.\n主耶稣基督，神之子，感谢你怜悯我。\nPraise Colossians 1.13-18a, 19, 20a The Father has delivered us from the power of darkness,\nand transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son;\nIn whom we have redemption,\nthe forgiveness of sins.\nHe is the image of the invisible God,\nthe firstborn over all creation.\nFor in him all things were created,\nin heaven and on earth, visible and invisible.\nAll things were created through him and for him,\nhe is before all things and in him all things hold together.\nHe is the head of the body, the Church,\nhe is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead.\nIn him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell;\nand through him God was pleased to reconcile all things.\nGlory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit; as it was in the beginning is now\nand shall be for ever.

If you think it will help you, memorise parts or all of this litany to help you pray for yourself and others. When you use it, recite one paragraph and then pause to allow prayers to rise from your heart in line with its focus. The Spirit will bring to your mind specific issues or people to pray for. You can also use it throughout the day to help you continue praying whenever you remember. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to use all of it at once!

Leadership is natural. Amongst any group of children in a playground a leader will emerge. Every society in the world organises itself to have leaders. They do so because they recognise that there is some worthwhile goal that can only be achieved through common and organised effort.\nBecause God has created us with this inbuilt desire to organise our communities and to value leadership, some people have a natural desire to lead and other people have a natural desire to be led. Some enjoy the stimulation and challenge of leadership; others value the security of following someone else's lead.\nLeaders therefore tend to be strong willed, determined, ambitious and sometimes ruthless whereas followers tend to be compliant, willing, easily persuaded and mild.\nLeadership has been corrupted by the fall Although God has designed leadership for our good, the fall has corrupted it so that much harm has also been done. Some key aspects of leadership that are commonly encountered in the world have no place in the Kingdom of God:\n \u0026ldquo;Jesus called them together and said, \u0026quot;You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 10:42-44 NIV)\n Jesus said that amongst the Gentiles leaders lord it over the people and exercise authority but that it shall not be so among you. Sadly many churches have ignored this command. It is common for churches to have very controlling leaders. This is exactly how Jesus said it should not be.\nKingdom leadership is counter cultural Kingdom leadership is fundamentally counter cultural. It is very difficult for many leaders to accept that it is even possible to lead effectively in a way that is contrary to their culture. We must not say \u0026ldquo;in our culture you have to use authority to get anything done\u0026rdquo; since Jesus expressly says that Kingdom leadership is counter cultural.\nGifting, responsibility and authority All authority has been given to Jesus and he has given us authority as his disciples and representatives. Primarily that authority is given to each of us to establish God's Kingdom on earth. In his name we have authority over sickness and all the works of the devil. Jn 20:21\nBut we are all unique and called to be members of the body of Christ each contributing according to our gifting and ability:\n \u0026ldquo;For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you. Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 12:3-5 NIV)\n Some of those contributions involve carrying responsibility within the church. For instance, some are given the responsibility to lead God's people:\n \u0026ldquo;if his gift is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 12:8 NIV)\n Some responsibilities come with special authority, but responsibility and authority should not be confused. A responsibility is something you should do whereas authority is for something you may do. Many people may have authority to do something that only one person has responsibility for. For instance everyone may have authority to help put out the chairs, but just one person, the janitor, has the responsibility to make sure they are in place. The janitor may be given special authority to enable him to fulfil his responsibility, such as the authority to ask some members of the welcoming team to leave their duty and to help with the chairs. In the Kingdom we are all called to love and serve one another in joyful submission to Jesus our head.\nEsteem your leaders 1 Thess 5:12-13. Paul urges the church to highly esteem those who are over them in the Lord. Honour and respect is part of the Kingdom, but this must not stray into superiority. In some cultures it may be appropriate for a leader to wear special clothes or have a special place to sit, but where these things are used to reinforce ungodly leadership styles such as lording it over, or to make the leader appear superior, then it is wrong. Remember that Jesus specifically warned against those who sat in special seats:\n \u0026ldquo;Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the market-places.\u0026rdquo; (Lu 11:43 NIV)\n Authority structures Churches seem to love authority structures where authority is delegated down from the head to various layers below. Such structures are a means of control. Leaders love to be in control. Most leaders assume that it is their duty to be in control and that such control is necessary to fulfil the duty they have been appointed to. But this is not the model that Jesus gives us, nor the model of the New Testament church. People often talk about serving the leadership, but that is the reverse of what Jesus taught. He said:\n \u0026ldquo;For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u0026quot; (Mk 10:45 NIV)\n Lording it over people Lording it over is when someone says, \u0026ldquo;Because I am a special or a superior person you should obey me.\u0026rdquo; e.g. Because I am \u0026ldquo;anointed by God\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Because I am God\u0026rsquo;s apostle or prophet\u0026rdquo; or even \u0026ldquo;Because I am educated\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I am an expert in this field\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I am a white man\u0026rdquo;.\nJesus said that Lording it over is not appropriate in the Kingdom. The exercise of leadership must not be based on a claim to superiority. We should never say or imply, \u0026ldquo;Because I planted this church you should obey me.\u0026rdquo;\nAuthority over people Although we may have authority amongst God's people because of our particular area of service, we are not to use that authority as a means of control. As with lording it over, we should not say or imply things such as, \u0026ldquo;Because of my position you should obey me.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Because I am the pastor...\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Because I am the youth leader...\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Because I am your apostle...\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Because I am your mother...\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Because I am a policeman...\u0026rdquo;\nAlthough the basis of the claim is different, both lording it over and exercising authority is claiming a right to tell you what to do in order to exercise control. They both expect and demand simple, unquestioning obedience. This wrongful exercise of control depends on the people being led feeling they have a duty to obey.\nSadly it is very common to see these mechanisms of control being taught and promoted in churches. Leaders are commonly elevated by the use of titles, special clothes, special treatment, special places to sit etc. in order to make them appear special. People naturally treat such elevated people as lords and so allow them and even expect them to lord it over them.\nPeople who are appointed to leadership positions are often given special titles to honour them for the sacrifice and service they offer to the church. But Jesus expressly warned about seeking honour from men:\n \u0026quot;they love to be honoured by men but not by God. They have their reward on earth.\u0026quot; (Matt 6:2)\n Seeking the glory of men has the effect of stopping us hearing from God:\n How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? (John 5:44)\n A title may be useful to identify a person's role, but should not be used to elevate them above those they lead.\nSo, both elevation of leaders as special people and the creation of positions of authority are common in churches as a means of control, but both rely on people having a sense of duty to obey.\nDuty We all have a duty to obey God and give willing obedience to godly leadership. Hebrews 11:17 says \u0026ldquo;obey those who lead you and be submissive.\u0026rdquo;\nThis obedience should be joyfully and willingly given, not demanded, and not obtained through false teaching, such as \u0026ldquo;if you serve and obey me without question God will bless you.\u0026rdquo;\nChurches where the leaders like to be in control make much of the command to obey the leaders. This is how leadership in the world works. Jesus said it should not be like this.\nKingdom leadership In the Kingdom we are not to use control as a means of leadership. We are not to require obedience from people or to rely on their sense of duty. The Kingdom is supposed to be characterised by Joy: \u0026ldquo;The joy of the Lord shall be your strength.\u0026rdquo; Demanding or shaming people to obedience breeds resentment and unhappiness.\nKingdom leadership depends not upon authority and duty but on vision, inspiration, empowerment and love.\nLeading by example Peter reiterates what Jesus said about leadership in the Kingdom:\n \u0026ldquo;Be shepherds of God\u0026rsquo;s flock that is under your care, serving as overseers\u0026mdash;not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.\u0026rdquo; (1Pe 5:2-4 NIV)\n\u0026ldquo;Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 11:1 NIV)\n We see here that the character of a leader is crucial, not just the ability to perform a task. Again this is counter-cultural. In the world leaders are usually appointed either through favouritism or because of the person\u0026rsquo;s skills. But in the Kingdom, example is the most important quality. If the person does not live what they tell others to do, they are not suitable for leadership.\nLeading by example is a very important principle which is often promoted in churches and is a reflection of how Jesus led. It is when a leader goes ahead of the people to show them what to do and demonstrate the kind of behaviour he/she wishes to see from those he leads.\nLeading by example is far more effective than leading by instruction and people often resent being told what to do by a leader who has not or will not do the task themselves. Also by doing the task themselves a leader will learn about the difficulties experienced and will have compassion for those he has asked to perform the task and try to provide the means for them. Doctors learn how to perform surgery by watching one being performed.\nHowever leading by example is often exhausting and frustrating. A leader should never sit idly by watching others work. The people we are trying to lead are rarely as faithful as we wish, they are rarely as thorough as we wish, and may not be as skilled as we wish. How a leader deals with this situation is a test of godly leadership. There is no point getting worked up about this, it is just a fact of life. But we may be able to improve things by sharing our vision for the task more effectively or by providing more training or resources.\nLeadership in the home It is much easier to behave well and serve one another in church that it is at home. That is why Paul makes a godly home a qualification of leadership in the church:\n \u0026ldquo;Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect. (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God\u0026rsquo;s church?)\u0026rdquo; (1Ti 3:2-5 NIV)\n Godly servant leadership must be applied in our own homes if we are to be authentic leaders in the church.\nServant leadership Servant leadership is the least well understood aspect of Kingdom leadership. It is very easy to talk about servant leadership and to teach that we should be servant leaders without properly understanding who is to be served.\nAll leadership is for the purpose of serving some agreed goal. Sales managers for Coca-Cola serve the directors and shareholders and in return receive their pay, but that does not make them servant leaders.\nLeaders are called to serve Jesus and the vision of the church. But that is not what servant leadership is about. Jesus said \u0026ldquo;I came not to be served but to serve...\u0026rdquo; Servant leaders are those who serve the people they are leading. This is commonly understood when it comes to the pastor, but what about those with smaller spheres of leadership such as a choir leader? Who exactly are they called to serve? They have two areas of service which are simply the duty of any leader; they serve their immediate \u0026ldquo;superior\u0026rdquo; (their pastor) and they serve their ultimate superior (Jesus). But those areas of service are not what servant leadership is about. To be a servant leader they must also serve the people they are leading.\nThat is the example Jesus gave us to follow - to serve those we lead. In the Kingdom leadership is a service that we offer to the body of Christ. Each one of us is called to serve Christ and to be an ambassador of the Kingdom. We pray \u0026ldquo;Your Kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven\u0026rdquo;; that is our common goal and is the purpose of the church. We can serve that goal in hundreds of different ways, some of which are best accomplished in teams with a leader. The leader serves the members by helping them to achieve a goal they value. This leadership service may include inspiring someone with confidence to aim for something they would never have believed possible. It may include rousing them when they feel tired to put in effort that they would otherwise not have the discipline to do for themselves. Leadership service includes clearly explaining the reason for the task being performed and envisioning the team members so that they willingly give sufficient priority to the team activities.\nServant leadership does not include coercing members to do what they don't want to do. We must not resort to threats, or shame, or the appeal to our authority or to a person's duty to obey. These are all attempts to control a person and that is not a part of Kingdom leadership.\nIf a person is not willing to participate in the way the leader wishes then the leader must go back to Jesus with the problem. Either the leader\u0026rsquo;s goal is wrong, or they have failed to share the vision for the goal clearly enough, or else the person is inappropriate for the team.\nLeadership teams Cooperation between leaders is often difficult to achieve. The problem is that they are all leaders and not used to being led. Cooperation requires leaders to allow others to set their direction. Genuine cooperation between leaders only occurs when they recognise that a goal they value can only be achieved through cooperation. The task of leading a leadership team is therefore fundamentally one of identifying a common goal and envisioning the team so that they willingly subjugate their own priorities for the sake of this greater goal.\nHowever, where the team is brought together with the specific purpose of encouraging leaders to share their experience and to influence one another in order to shape the direction of the church and its mission, teams can work very well and become very open to the Holy Spirit\u0026rsquo;s leading.\nAuthority structures Since Jesus says that authority should not be used to exercise control in the Kingdom, we should be wary of hierarchical authority structures in the church. Jesus is the head and we are all members of his body, and before Christ none is more important than another. We are all answerable to Jesus as our authority. All Jesus' sheep hear his voice. Each of us have gifts we bring to the body. Some are gifts of service and others are gifts of leadership. Just because a person serves through leading does not make them more important to Jesus and it does not give them a right to control people.\nIn terms of authority it is better to think of a flat structure rather than a hierarchy. A flat structure helps to remind us that leadership is not about control but is offered as a service alongside all the other kinds of service performed. We should not be demanding obedience from those we lead. Peter says that obedience should be offered freely without compulsion. 1 Peter 5:2-5.\nCommunication structures Although authority structures are better thought of as flat, communication structures may need to be hierarchical in a larger church for purely practical purposes. But friendships should be nurtured across such structures. It is very unhealthy for a pastor to only have other leaders as friends. They soon forget what it is like to be a member of the congregation, and can make unreasonable demands.\nDelegation Delegation is often used as a means of multiplying servants in the church. This may be good for sustaining the church program, but it may not be good for the wider calling on the church. The crying need of the Kingdom is not servants but servant-leaders. We need to be sending disciples into all the world to make disciples. The church should not be focused on its own programs but on training and releasing leaders. For this to happen, delegation should be seen as a way of multiplying leaders, not just servants.\nWhether we see delegation as a means of multiplying servants or leaders will determine how we appoint leaders. If we want servants we will appoint compliant leaders, \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; men who will not give us trouble, or we may look primarily for natural leaders who can motivate and command obedience. But if we want to produce leaders for the Kingdom we will look for those with a passion for Christ and the ability to hear Him. We will look for people who are developing their own unique calling. We will not want to control them but to develop them. They may or may not be natural leaders; either way Kingdom leadership principles and values must be nurtured. Kingdom leadership is more about character than skills.\nThis is often a real challenge to the existing leadership. Where leadership is used as a means of control you will not develop leaders, but only servants. You might call them leaders, but the reality is you want servants.\nReleasing leaders A leader with true Kingdom vision will want to train and release leaders, not just train people to serve his own vision. Jesus is the King and we must release leaders to serve Him. To develop leaders you need to give authority and freedom:\n \u0026ldquo;When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick.\u0026rdquo; (Lu 9:1-2 NIV)\n A leader who has no authority to take initiative and make decisions will never be more than a servant. As a leader grows in their faith and ability they need to be given more freedom to serve Jesus directly, without constant supervision and the requirement to report back.\nA beautiful example of this is given by Mary at the wedding in Cana. Mary has a situation that needs sorting out. She leaves the responsibility to Jesus and the servants:\n On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee \u0026hellip; When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, \u0026ldquo;They have no more wine.\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip; His mother said to the servants, \u0026ldquo;Do whatever he tells you.\u0026rdquo;\n Leaders need to learn to do more than faithfully perform a duty. They need to learn how to hear from God, receive or develop a vision, search the scriptures to learn what God says about their vision, inspire others to embrace the vision, and persevere through many setbacks and discouragements to see the vision become a reality.\nReleasing churches The church belongs to Jesus and he is the head. The umbilical cord between a mother church and a church plant should therefore be cut as soon as possible to encourage dependence upon Jesus and rapid growth. However because church leaders are often tempted by the lure of \u0026quot;kingdom building\u0026rdquo; they rarely release leaders fully. They want to retain control, even over church plants. Leaders want to impose their version of church over other churches. The excuse usually given for the mother church to retain authority over a church plant is in order to ensure it keeps to the vision and values. But what right does one church have to act as the head of another? Jesus is the head. As soon as a church can stand on its own it should be released to Jesus. Of course relationships of friendship and mutual support should remain and the mother church may continue to serve the church plant with training and other resources, but the retention of control should be seriously questioned.\nThe labourer is worthy of his wages Jesus and the apostles taught that labourer is worthy of his wages:\n \u0026ldquo;Stay in that house, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. \u0026quot;When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is set before you. Heal the sick who are there and tell them, \u0026lsquo;The kingdom of God is near you.'\u0026rdquo; (Lu 10:7-9 NIV)\n But note that Jesus is very particular about eating whatever you are given. In other words, accept the hospitality or rewards offered rather than demanding to be treated like royalty. The rewards or wages of ministry are gifts to be gratefully received, not demanded.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t we have the right to food and drink? Don\u0026rsquo;t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord\u0026rsquo;s brothers and Cephas? Or is it only I and Barnabas who must work for a living? ... If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you? If others have this right of support from you, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we have it all the more? ...In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.\u0026quot; 1 Cor 9:5-6, 11-12, 14\n Paul presents a forceful argument for his right to receive wages for his ministry in the Gospel (although as verse 18 shows, he did not make use of this right) and he urges churches to honour that right:\n \u0026ldquo;The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honour, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, \u0026quot;Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain,\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;The worker deserves his wages.\u0026quot;\u0026rdquo; (1Ti 5:17-18 NIV)\n It may well be that some members of a church may wish to offer those wages in practical service as well as or instead of money. But remember that giving, whether service or money should be done willingly and joyfully and without any compulsion:\n \u0026ldquo;Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.\u0026rdquo; (2Co 9:7 NIV)\n There is no New Testament support for requiring members to serve the pastor in his home duties or for the pastor having menial tasks performed for him by members. The wages given to a Gospel worker are to enable him to serve without restraint, not to elevate him above the congregation.\nThe five -fold ministries In addition to apostles Jesus has given prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers, to equip the church in ministry. They are not given to do all the ministry but to equip others to do the ministry. So for example, all are encouraged by Paul to zealously pursue the gift of prophecy and all are encouraged to hear God for themselves, but prophets are given to encourage and inspire others in growing in these areas. They also have a role in helping to discern what God is saying to the church through the body. A prophet must not use his role as a means of control. He must not seek to control the congregation, or the leadership.\nEach of the ministry gifts are given to serve the church in their obedience to Jesus. Each ministry should operate in love and mutual submission to all the other ministries.\nSince these are given by Jesus to the church, it is not up to the pastor or apostle to simply appoint people to these offices. Rather it is a matter of recognising those whom Jesus has appointed.\nApostolic authority In some churches much is made of apostolic authority. I wish to make a few brief points. Apostles are for mission, not control When Jesus chose the twelve, we are told he called them \u0026ldquo;apostles\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;sent ones\u0026rdquo;. This tells us that apostleship is not primarily about authority over churches but mission. Remember that the great commission is to go into all the world to spread the good news of the Kingdom, not just to run churches. Christ gives apostles to the church to serve them in mission not to control them:\n \u0026ldquo;Through him and for his name\u0026rsquo;s sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.\u0026rdquo; (Ro 1:5 NIV)\n Apostles have authority in the churches they plant Because the calling on an apostle is to \u0026ldquo;go into all the world...\u0026rdquo; and plant churches, it is natural that during the early years of a church the apostle will have authority in the churches they helped plant:\n \u0026ldquo;... built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.\u0026rdquo; (Eph 2:20 NIV)\n Apostles plant churches and become \u0026quot;foundational\u0026quot; through relationship. The church is not founded by studying a systematic theology, but by the example, teaching and instruction of the apostle:\n \u0026ldquo;They devoted themselves to the apostles\u0026rsquo; teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.\u0026rdquo; (Ac 2:42 NIV)\n It is natural and proper for a church to give close attention to the biblical teaching of the apostle. That is how the Kingdom works - through people and relationships. Jesus works the truth into us and out through us. And so Paul urges the churches to follow the pattern he has passed on to them.\n \u0026ldquo;What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.\u0026rdquo; (2Ti 1:13 NIV)\n The relationship is forged in love and fatherly concern and care. The relationship naturally includes an aspect of authority, but the exercise of that authority must be subject to scripture, including testing what the apostle is saying:\n \u0026ldquo;Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.\u0026rdquo; (Ac 17:11 NIV)\n Apostles bring teaching directly to the church Where the apostolic relationship is genuinely relational and foundational then it is to be expected that the apostle will relate directly with the church members and not only through the leadership. They may therefore bring correction directly to a church without deferring to the leadership. We see this in the various epistles where teaching is addressed directly to church members. However this apostolic relationship must not usurp the autonomy of the local church or undermine the leadership. Paul repeatedly urges the people to honour and respect their leaders.\nApostles may advise leaders Visiting ministries are able to take a more objective view of things than is possible for those in local leadership, and as such may offer advice about vision, focus, church programs or practices. The apostle will want to see that leaders are being developed and released to new ministries rather than the local church program simply growing ever bigger.\nChurches can very easily become inward looking or maintenance minded whereas the Apostle\u0026rsquo;s calling to \u0026ldquo;go\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; will help to keep the wider calling to mission before the leaders.\nIt is all too easy for leaders to expect members to come to multiple meetings each week and to make attendance a mark of commitment or discipleship. The effect may be to burden people with heavy expectations that are difficult for them to meet and may detract from discipleship and mission as people spend less time amongst unbelievers because they spend so much time at church meetings. Jesus warned about overloading people with requirements that are not from Jesus:\n They tie up heavy loads and put them on men\u0026rsquo;s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. (Matt 23:4)\n Apostles may bring correction to leaders Where leadership proves to be false or hypocritical, we see both Jesus and Paul publicly reprimanding leadership:\nOn a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues ... Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler said to the people, \u0026ldquo;There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.\u0026rdquo; The Lord answered him, \u0026ldquo;You hypocrites! Doesn\u0026rsquo;t each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?\u0026rdquo; (Lk 13:10,14-15)\nWhen Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong. (Gal 2:11)\nThe apostle may have a duty to intervene if things go badly wrong with the church leader.\nApostolic Delegates An apostle may send someone in his place as a delegate for a particular purpose as Paul did, sending Timothy, but it is hard to see how the apostolic role can be delegated, since it is Jesus who gives these gifts.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0a5d23ad36c38460f9ab0d80b968e1ed","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/leadership-_-jesus-style-v2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/leadership-_-jesus-style-v2/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Leadership \u0026ndash; Jesus Style Leadership is natural.

Certainly leadership often requires difficult decisions and should not bow to favouritism, but the exercise of leadership can never justify acts that are contrary to genuine godly love.  Galatians 6:1 Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted.** **\n Openness   \u0026ldquo;But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.\u0026rdquo; (John 3:21)\nBut if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin. (1 John 1:7 )\n Leaders must walk in the light together; they must be open with one another about their vision for the future they seek to lead people to and their own strengths and weaknesses. Leadership must be shared so that the variety of contributions that Christ has provided in the church can all contribute to a wholesome and healthy leadership team. Integrity  Leaders must live what they preach as far as they are able. They must lead by example and not just by exhortation. And this example must include the way they handle leadership relationships and leadership difficulties. Handling Leadership Conflict A leader\u0026rsquo;s response to accusations against them  Leaders must learn how to handle accusations against them and disagreements with other leaders. Leadership is a high calling and comes with great responsibilities. The standard of love for leaders is high. John says  \u0026ldquo;This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.\u0026rdquo; (1 John 3:16)\n A leader\u0026rsquo;s first response to accusations or disagreements should be to lay down his life rather than defend himself.  That is why, for Christ\u0026rsquo;s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. (2 Corinthians 12:10)\n This is the example Jesus left for us.  But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you. (Matthew 5:44)\nFor what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. (1 Peter 2:20-21)\n If this is how Jesus wants us to behave towards the enemies of the truth, how much more should we show this forgiveness and love towards our fellow leaders. Sadly, leaders are so often very defensive, strongly defending and justifying their actions and respond to accusations with accusations. Forgiveness  Jesus warned us that if we do not forgive those who sin against us, neither will our Father forgive us. Responsibility for conflict resolution  Everyone in the body of Christ is responsible for conflict resolution. No one who sees conflict has the right to stand by and say nothing. We must all guard the unity of Christ\u0026rsquo;s body. But leaders clearly have the prime responsibility to resolve conflict. Again, no leader can stand aside saying \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s not my responsibility\u0026rdquo; but the lead leader is ultimately responsible before God for those in his care, and he must not shirk the responsibly for resolving conflicts that arise within his church or in his leadership team. The causes of conflict  Effective teams will have a willingness to disagree, yet hold each other accountable to not move into destructive conflict. Conflict arises out of a perceived inadequate response to a problem or disagreement. For instance, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t feel you have given sufficient consideration to my view.\u0026rdquo; The cause may be serious moral or doctrinal error which may require a matter to be confronted and may result in conflict. But it is more usually a disagreement about vision, strategy, roles, structure, implementation or personal preferences that ought to be resolved without conflict. It is important to identify the actual problem that gave rise to the conflict. James suggests that we need to start by searching our own hearts:  What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don\u0026rsquo;t they come from your desires that battle within you? (James 4:1)\n Conflict between people is often the result of conflict within an individual. This inner conflict may not be obvious to that person. When we feel the need to speak or act in way that could give rise to conflict, we should first ask God to help us examine our own heart to reveal what is causing this strong emotion. The following questions should be prayerfully considered both individually and collectively to identify how the conflict has arisen:   What is the problem that has given rise to this conflict? Try to dig down to the root issues.   What part has each person contributed to this conflict arising?   What part is pride playing in this conflict?   What part are mistakes, inexperience or inadequate knowledge playing?   Resolving conflict  Conflict resolution is about winning hearts not arguments. It requires that each person listens carefully to the other, and then echoes back in as few words as possible what they think they have heard. The following questions should be prayerfully considered both individually and collectively to try and find a godly way forward.   Are we being open with each other about the real issues?   Are there behavioural issues that need addressing?   How can we imitate and glorify Jesus in handling this issue?   Can we bring in a peace-maker to help us resolve this in a godly way?   What positive thing would each person like to come out of resolving this issue?   Initiating conflict  Before initiating a potential conflict consider the following advice:   Never react in the heat of the moment. Get at least one night\u0026rsquo;s sleep between the decision to initiate the potential conflict and the implementation of that decision.   Pray until you are sure that this is what Jesus wants you to do.   Seek the advice of an experienced leader who is not involved in the situation.   Discuss the wisdom of your intention with your spouse.   Discuss the wisdom of your intention with your fellow leaders.   If you are sure you should initiate a potential conflict, only raise the essential issue. Do not raise any non-essential side issues. They will become the focus instead of the core issue and make resolution much more difficult.   When raising the issue do not make accusations against the other person. Stick to your own observations and feelings, and report only facts, not hearsay. Remember that you are trying to establish truth, not win an argument.   Healthy church audit  Many churches find it helpful to have a \u0026ldquo;healthy church audit\u0026rdquo;. You invite a leader from another church to interview a cross section of the leadership and the wider congregation in order to discover of they really have a common vision and to see if the teaching, pastoral and leadership functions within the church are healthy and effective. They then report back to the leadership team to help them improve the quality of their leadership. ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f800930044b1e92a0012de7ada077b0b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/leadership-relationships/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/leadership-relationships/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Leadership relationships  Love  Love between believers is the first and fundamental commandment of Jesus, yet many leaders seem to think that leadership takes priority over love.

It is easy to run to one extreme or another, and the enemy of our soul is happy for us to follow one extreme as the other.\nOne area where balance is necessary is the place of self-examination. Too much looking inward, too much self-examination, is a bad thing. The focus of the Christian life is Jesus Christ, not self. We are to die to self and live to Jesus. On the other side, to never spend time in true self-examination is also dangerous. We must, from time to time, examine our life and work ( spend time in true self-examination is also dangerous. We must, from time to time, examine our life and work (1 Corinthians 11:28, 2 Corinthians 13:5, and Galatians 6:4).\nMany years ago, I read this section by Alan Redpath, taken from his wonderful book on Nehemiah, Victorious Christian Service. I recommend it to you as a good checklist of self-examination, and trust that you will use it properly.\nSELF-EXAMINATION QUESTIONS\nby Alan Redpath\nSome time ago at an all-night of prayer in my church I read a list I use myself called \u0026ldquo;Self-examination questions,\u0026rdquo; because I am desperately concerned in my own life on these things. I want to give this list to you, lest you think it is a comfortable, easy sort of business, this recognition of sin:\nWHAT ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MEN?\nAm I consciously or unconsciously creating the impression that I am a better man than I really am? Is there the least suspicion of hypocrisy in my life? Am I honest in all my words and acts? Do I exaggerate?\nAm I reliable? Can I be trusted? Do I confidentially pass on what was told to me in confidence? Do I grumble and complain in the church?\nAm I jealous, impure, irritable, touchy, distrustful? Am I self- conscious, self-pitying, or self-justifying? Am I proud? Do I thank God I am not as other people? Is there anyone I fear, or dislike, or criticize, or resent? If so, what am I doing about it?\nWHAT ABOUT MY DEVOTION TO GOD?\nDoes the Bible live to me? Do I give it time to speak to me? Do I go to bed in time and do I get up in time?\nAm I enjoying my prayer life today? Did I enjoy it this morning? When I am involved in a problem in life, do I talk about it or pray about it?\nAm I disobeying God in anything, or insisting upon doing something about which my conscience is very uneasy?\nWhen did I last speak to someone else with the object of trying to win him for Christ?\nAm I a slave to books, dress, friends, work, or what others think? How do I spend my spare time?\nALAN REDPATH, VICTORIUS CHRISTIAN SERVICE\nKevin Halloran\nOur physical lives need routine check-ups to see that we are healthy and to prevent and diagnose health problems before they become a major threat to our lives. Our spiritual lives are susceptible to problems as well and require self-examination in order to purge the unhealthy tendencies we have and replace them with the habits that God desires.\nHere are 7 Questions to evaluate where you are in the Christian life:\n1. Am I praying with faith?\nI could have asked, \u0026ldquo;Am I praying?\u0026rdquo; That would be a good question, but this question goes further. In Luke 18, Jesus teaches us that we ought always to pray. Then at the end of that teaching he asks a question: \u0026ldquo;When the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth?\u0026rdquo; Notice, He doesn\u0026rsquo;t ask, \u0026ldquo;Will the son of man find prayer on the earth?\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;Will the son of man find faith on the earth?\u0026rdquo; Why? Because what matters is not that I am saying my prayers, like the Pharisees did, and like millions of people in all religions around the world do.\nWhat matters is that I\u0026rsquo;m praying with faith. Do I have confidence in God to do more than I can do? Or have I wandered into the spiritual wasteland of evaluating everything in terms of what I see as humanly possible\u0026mdash;the easiest thing to do when you\u0026rsquo;ve been a Christian for 10, 20, 30 years.\n2. Am I serving with zeal?\nI take this question straight from the Scriptures. Romans 12:8 says \u0026ldquo;The one who leads,\u0026rdquo; must lead \u0026ldquo;with zeal.\u0026rdquo; There\u0026rsquo;s something about passion here, something about vision and something about direction. The leader must care passionately about where he or she is going. 1 Peter 5:2 says to leaders, \u0026ldquo;Be shepherds of God\u0026rsquo;s flock that is under your care, serving as overseers, not because you must but because you are willing as God wants you to be.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the film, Parenthood, Steve Martin plays an overworked father trying to do his best for a family under pressure. One day he quits his job, and when he gets home, he finds the kids running wild and his wife tells him that she is pregnant. He does not react well. Then when it\u0026rsquo;s time to take his son to a baseball game, his wife wants to talk and she says, \u0026ldquo;Do you have to?\u0026rdquo; He says, \u0026ldquo;My whole life is \u0026lsquo;have to.'\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ve been there, and so have I. But that\u0026rsquo;s not a place from which we can lead others. Are you serving with zeal?\n3. Am I believing with confidence?\nGod says that \u0026ldquo;the gospel\u0026hellip; is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes\u0026rdquo; (Romans 1:16). Do I believe that? Do I believe that when I pray for an unbelieving friend or relative? Do I believe that God is able to save them through the Gospel?\nWhen I struggle with a powerful temptation, with a habit that is difficult to overcome, do I believe that God is able to deliver me through the Gospel? When I become tired, get discouraged, begin to wonder how long I can continue, do I believe that the God who saved me is able to keep me?\n4. Am I confessing with humility?\nMartin Luther said, \u0026ldquo;When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said \u0026lsquo;Repent,\u0026rsquo; He meant that the whole life of a believer should be repentance.\u0026rdquo; Christ calls us, not to a prayer of repentance, but to a life of repentance, a life of turning ever more fully to Jesus Christ.\nA life of repentance is not a life of misery, but a life of growth. It\u0026rsquo;s a life in which the Holy Spirit is constantly opening your eyes to how you can take the next step in becoming more like Jesus. A process of examination like this may begin to connect this reality with your life now.\nA Christian is a person who has light to see what there needs to be less of and what there needs to be more of in his or her life. This leads to a life of confession, in which you see your sins and your failings, and you keep bringing them under the blood of Christ.\nWhen you live life like this, you don\u0026rsquo;t waste your life in the shallow water of compromised obedience, instead you launch out into the deep oceans of following Christ. Can you name a sin that you have confessed in the last week? In the last month?\n5. Am I worshipping with joy?\nI come to worship. Do I participate or do I observe? In the presence of Jesus, there will not be a single person with their arms folded, listening to the angels and observing the worship. We will all sing. We will all shout for joy. Ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Am I worshipping with joy?\u0026rdquo; If not, why not?\n6. Am I giving with gladness?\nGiving is an indicator of love within marriage. A marriage that\u0026rsquo;s marked by withholding is not healthy. Giving is also an indicator of your love for Christ and your love for the bride of Christ. \u0026ldquo;I work to earn money that I gladly give to the bride.\u0026rdquo; Is that true of me? Or am I tiring of that?\n7. Am I reaching out with love?\nHere we are in a world of need, and some Christians are stretched out in sacrifice, so that lost people on their way to an eternal darkness may see the light of Christ through the Gospel and be saved.

That is how God has made us and He has used our \u0026quot;get things done\u0026quot; character to get things done in His Kingdom. But we are called to do the impossible. His dreams are bigger than ours. We are called to be risk takers.\nWe need to be obsessed by Jesus\nBut to be fruitful in our risky endeavours we need to listen carefully to Jesus. We need to eat and drink Jesus. We need to get away to a lonely place and listen to Jesus. We need to be obsessed by Jesus and not by the things we try to do in His name.\nOur tendency is to make Him safe and acceptable\nJesus lived according to Kingdom culture and that often clashed with his native culture. That is the essence of living a prophetic life; courageously walking the Kingdom where it is contrary to our native culture. But our tendency is to make Jesus conform to our culture to make Him safe and acceptable.\nWe can easily become inoculated against Jesus\nCovid 19 has set the world on an unprecedented search for a vaccine to inoculate us against the virus. Vaccines generally work by presenting to our immune system a cut-down safe version of the virus, so that our body can recognise the virus and trigger its defence system to prevent it doing us harm. Christians face the opposite problem. Through frequent exposure to the Gospels, especially when made safe for public consumption, we can easily become inoculated against Jesus! We can nod in recognition of the familiar stories without letting them infect us. We have defences against the words that challenge the status quo. We can easily end up like the Pharisees in the Gospels, thinking that we are OK; it's the others who need to hear this.\nListening to Jesus needs to be a high priority in our lives\nSo my hope for these conferences is to re-expose us to the dangerous Jesus so that we get thoroughly infected by Him. My dream is that we all become obsessed with Jesus; that listening to Jesus becomes a high priority in our lives; that we become a truly prophetic people who hear and obey our extraordinary Lord.\nWhat is your response to this?\n\u0026quot;You are worried and upset about many things, but one thing is needed\u0026quot;\n Luke 10:38 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord\u0026rsquo;s feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, \u0026ldquo;Lord, don\u0026rsquo;t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Martha, Martha,\u0026rdquo; the Lord answered, \u0026ldquo;you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed\u0026mdash;or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.\u0026rdquo;\n What is Jesus saying to you through this incident?\nDiscipleship is not about doctrine or behaviour. It is teaching people to listen to Jesus.\nThe primary need that all of us have is to sit with and listen to Jesus. Discipleship is not about teaching people good doctrine, or good behaviour. It is teaching people to listen to Jesus. Everything else flows naturally from that.\nWhat does Jesus want you to do about this?\n  In your own devotional life?\n  In your own Growth Group?\n  In your leadership role?\n  In your discipling of others?\n  In your church?\n  Listening To Jesus Conference \u0026ndash; Session 2 (10/10/2020) Familiarity Breeds Contempt Our calling is to give Jesus to people\nOur calling is to release the Kingdom of God into people's lives and communities; it is to give Jesus to them so that they can respond to Jesus' invitation:\n Matt 11:28-30 \u0026quot;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\u0026quot;\n Is this how you see your mission?\nWe need to \u0026quot;camp\u0026quot; in the Gospels and feed on Jesus\nI cannot listen for you, nor can I make you listen, but I can invite you to sit at Jesus feet with me. If I visit your home you find a seat for me to sit in whilst we talk. I can give you a chair to sit in at Jesus feet. As a shepherd I cannot put the grass in your mouth and make you eat, but I can take you to where the grass is green and invite you to eat. When you find good pasture, you want to stay there and enjoy it. I call this \u0026quot;camping in the scripture\u0026quot;. I pitch my tent and stay there, usually for at least a week or two, and often much longer.\nSo here now is the pasture I want to invite you to camp in with me.\nA clash between Kingdom and native culture\nLuke 4:14-30.\nThis is a story of Jesus loving the people he loves most \u0026ndash; those He grew up with. But it is a very surprising story. This is dangerous Jesus!\n Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom.\n There are only two people mentioned by name in this story. One is Jesus, the other is His father, Joseph. I want you to imagine you are Joseph. And to help you get into character I'm going to do a little imagining. So close your eyes and put yourself into the story.\nEverything looks nice, everyone is happy\nEveryone has come early today to try and get a seat. Look around you. Here are all your friends and family, that you have grown up with and know intimately. This is your synagogue, which your parents helped to build when you were a child. You helped carry the water and mould the mud bricks. You remember the day when the community held the first synagogue service here. You feel secure and at home.\nToday there is much excitement because in recent weeks, your first son Jesus has become the talk of the town and all the towns round about. He has become a powerful and popular preacher in the district. He is coming home today and everyone wants to hear all His stories. The Rabbi said it wouldn't be appropriate for Jesus to talk about Himself in the service, so He is just reading the lesson. But we are all staying afterwards to hear His stories.\nAs the familiar service gets underway your mind wanders back to the last time you saw Jesus, 12 Sabbaths ago. That Friday afternoon as you were clearing up the workshop in preparation for the Sabbath, Jesus cleaned his tools and put them away, then he turned to you, looked you in the eyes and said, \u0026quot;Father. It is finished.\u0026quot; You feel again the shiver that went down your spine at these words. You asked Jesus what He meant. He said, \u0026quot;I have completed the work I have to do for you. I must now go and do my heavenly Father's work.\u0026quot; He left that afternoon for Jerusalem and you haven't seen Him since. Today He has come home. Your attention comes back as Jesus is asked to read.\nThey all love the reading\n He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:\n\u0026ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, \u0026ldquo;Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\u0026rdquo;\nAll spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t this Joseph\u0026rsquo;s son?\u0026rdquo; they asked.\n Everyone looks at you, and your heart brims with pride at how one of your sons has become such a renowned and popular preacher. You can't wait for the service to end so you can hear Jesus tell of all the healings that you have heard about.\nThere are smiles on everyone's faces and the service is about to move onto the prayers and the final blessing. But we never get to the prayers. The service ends in utter chaos \u0026ndash; worse than that, it ends in a riot! Just as the Rabbi is about to start the prayers, Jesus speaks again.\nJesus deliberately provokes them\n Jesus said to them, \u0026ldquo;Surely you will quote this proverb to me: \u0026lsquo;Physician, heal yourself!\u0026rsquo; And you will tell me, \u0026lsquo;Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.\u0026rsquo; Truly I tell you,\u0026rdquo; he continued, \u0026ldquo;no prophet is accepted in his hometown. I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah\u0026rsquo;s time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land. Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed\u0026mdash;only Naaman the Syrian.\u0026rdquo;\nAll the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.\n You can't move with shock. You are the only one left sitting in the synagogue, but you see it all through the open door. You are shocked and shaken. You are confused and dismayed. You can hardly believe what has just happened.\nJesus walks away\nThe last thing you see is Jesus walking away from the village. And now here you are; alone, wondering.\nQuestions What did Joseph think?\nStaying in character as Joseph, what is your reaction to this incident?\nWhat other characters are there that we could imagine being? - an angry member of the congregation, the leading Rabbi, an uncomprehending child, one of Jesus' disciples, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, God the Father, a passer-by, a sparrow! And finally, a 21^st^ century reader.\nWhat do you think?\nAs a 21^st^ century reader what are your immediate reactions / thoughts / questions about this?\n  Why did Jesus provoke them?\n  Why did they react so strongly?\n  Why did Jesus walk away?\n  No prophet is accepted in his hometown\nLet's try to answer some of these questions by thinking about what Jesus said after the people said \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t this Joseph\u0026rsquo;s son?\u0026rdquo; (v22):\n Jesus said to them, \u0026ldquo;Surely you will quote this proverb to me: \u0026lsquo;Physician, heal yourself!\u0026rsquo; And you will tell me, \u0026lsquo;Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.\u0026rsquo;\n Although outwardly the entire congregation are enthusiastic about what Jesus said, in their hearts, Jesus knows they are sceptical about the reports they have been hearing from nearby Capernaum. The reason for this is indicated by the next thing Jesus says:\n Truly I tell you,\u0026rdquo; he continued, \u0026ldquo;no prophet is accepted in his hometown.\u0026quot;\n What is a prophet? \u0026ndash; Someone whom God has called to bring God's specific revelation to others.\nWhat does it mean to \u0026quot;accept\u0026quot; a prophet (what kind of response is God looking for?) \u0026ndash; Give special consideration to what they have to say; to listen carefully in the expectation that God wants to say something important to you.\nWhy is a prophet not accepted in his hometown? The congregation see Jesus as a familiar member of their community \u0026ndash; someone they grew up with. They do not think of him as anyone special. They are used to discussing ideas as all equally valid, from which they hope to come to some common agreement.\nWhy was this not a problem at Capernaum?\nCan the Gospel stories become too familiar to impact us?\nDo you think we can become so familiar with the Gospel stories that we miss what Jesus wants to say to us?\nListening To Jesus conference \u0026ndash; Session 3 (17/Oct/2020) We don't like being challenged! Aim: To become a truly prophetic people who hear and obey our extraordinary Lord.\nJesus lived according to Kingdom culture and that often clashed with his native culture. We are called to courageously walk in Kingdom culture where it is contrary to our native culture.\nIn our first session we reminded ourselves that, like Mary, we must listen to Jesus and not just busy ourselves with many distractions like Martha.\nI reminded you that discipleship is not about teaching people good doctrine, or good behaviour. It is teaching people to listen to Jesus.\nLast week, in our second session, I reminded you that our mission is to bring people to Jesus so they can find rest for their souls in Him.\nAnd then we looked at Luke 4:14-30 - Jesus visiting his home synagogue after His baptism. We thought about this story from Joseph's point of view.\nWhat is Jesus saying to you?\nWhen I read this story a few months ago I felt the Holy Spirit say that He wanted to speak to me through it. At the time I had no idea what He wanted to say to me. I had to stop and listen. I read it many times praying over it, asking Jesus to speak to me. I went for long walks thinking it over and listening to the Holy Spirit. He taught me many things and showed me more about Jesus. I wonder if any of you have that sense of \u0026quot;Yes. Jesus wants to speak to me through this story.\u0026quot;\nDoes anyone want to share anything about your encounter with this story so far?\nImagine you are one of those who drove Jesus away\nThis week I want you to think about the story as if you were one of those who drove Jesus away.\n Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom.\n Everyone has come early today to try and get a seat. Look around you. Here are all your friends and family, that you have grown up with and know intimately. This is your synagogue, which your parents helped to build when you were a child. You helped carry the water and mould the mud bricks. You remember the day when the community held the first synagogue service here. You feel secure and at home.\nToday there is much excitement because in recent weeks, your school-mate Jesus has become the talk of the town and all the towns round about. He has become a powerful and popular preacher in the district. He is coming home today and everyone wants to hear all His stories. The Rabbi said it wouldn't be appropriate for Jesus to talk about Himself in the service, so He is just reading the lesson. But we are all staying afterwards to hear His stories.\nAs the familiar service gets underway your mind wanders back to your youth when you and Jesus got up to some fine pranks \u0026ndash; you remember the night you secretly got into the Rabbi's house and tied his prayer-tassels into such a terrible knot that he had to go through the service the next day with them all tangled. You got into terrible trouble \u0026ndash; not because of the tangles, but because you did it on the Sabbath. You had such a laugh. Your attention comes back as Jesus is asked to read.\nYou love the reading\n He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:\n\u0026ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, \u0026ldquo;Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\u0026rdquo;\nAll spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t this Joseph\u0026rsquo;s son?\u0026rdquo; they asked.\n Everyone looks at Joseph, and you feel a certain pride that you were one of Jesus' best childhood friends.\nThere are smiles on everyone's faces and the service is about to move onto the prayers and the final blessing. But we never get to the prayers. The service ends in utter chaos \u0026ndash; worse than that, it ends in a riot! Just as the Rabbi is about to start the prayers, Jesus speaks again.\nJesus deliberately provokes you\n Jesus said to them, \u0026ldquo;Surely you will quote this proverb to me: \u0026lsquo;Physician, heal yourself!\u0026rsquo; And you will tell me, \u0026lsquo;Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.\u0026rsquo; Truly I tell you,\u0026rdquo; he continued, \u0026ldquo;no prophet is accepted in his hometown.

And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed\u0026mdash;only Naaman the Syrian.\u0026rdquo;\n You are taken aback at this. For a start, the Rabbi had said that Jesus wasn't to preach, but only to read the lesson. But what a strange way to carry on. Everyone was happy and smiling until Jesus accused them of being stiff-necked. That's what the privileged people up in Jerusalem say about us northerners. They are always quoting the prophets at us and telling us how our ancestors filled the land with Baal worshippers. They love telling the stories of Elijah and Elisha, but they never fail to point out that our ancestors rejected their message, and that eventually God sent the Assyrians to make slaves of them. We are stigmatised as stiff-necked people that reject God's message. And now, here is Jesus, one of our own, quoting Elijah and Elisha at us again! Who does he think he is? Does he think he is better than the rest of us?\nYou drive Jesus away\n All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.\n You don't have any idea that God has given your old school friend a message He really wants you to receive; a message to challenge and change you; to bring you into His Kingdom in a new way.\nImagining yourself to be one of those angry people \u0026ndash; what made you so angry?\nWhy did you want to drive Jesus away?\nCompassion for the angry response\nHow do you respond when you are challenged about what you are doing?\n  Angry\n  Irritated\n  Defensive\n  Listen prayerfully!\n  We usually challenge-back:\n  \u0026quot;Who are you to question what I am doing?\u0026quot;\n  \u0026quot;What about this thing in your life?\u0026quot;\n  \u0026quot;Why should I listen to you?\u0026quot;\n  \u0026quot;What makes you so special that you can challenge me?\u0026quot;\n  \u0026quot;If you want me to listen then show me your results.\u0026quot;\n  What do you feel when the challenge has been shaken off?\n  I have stood my ground\n  I have regained control\n  I feel secure again\n  I know what I am doing\n  This is what people want\n  Imagine Jesus walking into your service and challenging what you are doing.\nWhat is your response?\nI encourage you to keep reading and meditating on this story and see what Jesus wants to say to you.\nNext time we will consider the story from Jesus' perspective.\nListening To Jesus conference \u0026ndash; Session 4 (24/Oct/2020) A Disrupting Visit from Jesus Aim: To become a truly prophetic people who hear and obey our extraordinary Lord.\nJesus lived according to Kingdom culture and that often clashed with his native culture. We are called to courageously walk in Kingdom culture where it is contrary to our native culture.\nIn our first session we reminded ourselves that, like Mary, we must listen to Jesus and not just busy ourselves with many distractions like Martha. Likewise discipling others centres on teaching them to listen to, and obey, Jesus. And our mission is to bring people to Jesus so they can find rest for their souls in Him.\nWe have been looking at Luke 4:14-30 - Jesus visiting his home synagogue after His baptism. We thought about this story from Joseph's point of view and then from the point of view of one of the angry congregation members.\nWhat is Jesus saying to you?\nDoes anyone want to share anything about your encounter with this story so far?\nHas this story made you think differently about how you listen to Jesus?\nImagine you are Jesus in this story\nThis week I want you to think about the story as if you were Jesus.\n Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom.\n Everyone has come early today to try and get a seat. Look around you. Here are all your friends and family, that you have grown up with and know intimately. As the familiar service gets underway the Holy Spirit starts to speak to you. \u0026quot;These dear people, your friends and family; they do not know the voice of God. They know He used to speak to the prophets, but they have no expectation that God would want to speak to them. They set out years ago to worship me by way of this synagogue service, but for most of them, most of the time, it has become more of a religious duty. It serves well in maintaining the social aspect of the community which I am very glad about. But I have called you to break out of the safety of the congregation and take the Good News of the Kingdom out into the hurting world. So plant the seed of My word into their hearts. And be prepared for a bumpy ride.\u0026quot; Your attention comes back as you are asked to read.\nThey love the reading\n He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:\n\u0026ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, \u0026ldquo;Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\u0026rdquo;\nAll spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t this Joseph\u0026rsquo;s son?\u0026rdquo; they asked.\n Whilst everyone is smiling and congratulating Joseph on having such a fine son, the Spriit speaks to you again. \u0026quot;They have dismissed the reading as a lovely familiar scripture and have no idea that God is actually announcing its fulfilment. You need to shake them up a bit. Get them to realise you are speaking for Me. Warn them not to dismiss your words simply because you are their friend. Remind them about Elijah and Elisha.\u0026quot; So just as the Rabbi is about to start the prayers, you interrupt:\nYou deliberately provoke the congregation\n Jesus said to them, \u0026ldquo;Surely you will quote this proverb to me: \u0026lsquo;Physician, heal yourself!\u0026rsquo; And you will tell me, \u0026lsquo;Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.\u0026rsquo; Truly I tell you,\u0026rdquo; he continued, \u0026ldquo;no prophet is accepted in his hometown.

And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed\u0026mdash;only Naaman the Syrian.\u0026rdquo;\nAll the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.\n You see the anger in people's faces and shoot up an arrow prayer, \u0026quot;I don't think they liked that! Instead of making them stop and listen, they are all murmuring and glaring at me.\u0026quot; The Spirit answers, \u0026quot;Yes. This happy community need a good shaking to get them to stop thinking about their services and to start thinking about the Kingdom. Many of them have got so much invested in the synagogue that they have not stopped to even consider that I might want to change things. But some will reflect on what has happened today and will seek you out to hear more. But we aren't done yet. I'm going to stir up such an angry outcry that they will not forget this day, and next week's service will be completely taken up with heart-searching about what happened today.\u0026quot;\nThey drive You away\n They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.\n As you walk away you talk to the Father.\nWhat conversation do you think might have taken place between Jesus and the Father?\n  Father, did I mess that up? Was that what you wanted to happen?\n  They have rejected me. What next? \u0026ndash; \u0026quot;Over to you, Holy Spirit...\u0026quot;\n  Should I go back and try to explain or reason with them?\n  Give me the courage to press on. Give them the sight to see the truth.\n  They don't know what they are doing. They are rejecting God truth for the lies of their culture.\n  Their tradition hardened their hearts.\n  Why did Jesus provoke them?\nWe need to ask \u0026quot;Why did Jesus deliberately provoke his congregation?\u0026quot; Remember that these were the people He knew and loved the best. We need to look closely at what he read to understand why Jesus provoked them.\n \u0026ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour.\u0026rdquo;\n What is the difference between this announcement and the normal synagogue service?\n  The power and presence of Jesus was not in the normal services.\n  The service was to benefit the congregation.\n  The poor, the prisoners, the blind and the oppressed were not in the synagogue.\n  Jesus was sent to those who didn't go to church.\n  Why do you think Jesus provoked them?\n  They had always had the synagogue services. They never even imagined they should do anything else.\n  They had so much invested in the synagogue and the services they were resistant to change.\n  They needed to discover, by their angry response, that they were more concerned about their own agenda than what God might want for them.\n  How many times do you think you have read this story in your whole life?\n  How many of those times have you smiled and said, \u0026quot;That's nice!\u0026quot;\n  Have you ever thought that Jesus might want to disrupt your life like He did for this synagogue?\n  Have you ever experienced an event that has seriously disrupted your normal church service?\n  Ebola, Covid 19, a storm damaging the building, bulldozers demolishing your church...\n  Did you stop to consider if Jesus had visited you in that event?\n  What might Jesus be wanting to do or say to you?\n  During the next week will you set time aside to pray through all we have been talking about?\n  Ask Jesus what He wants to say to you\n  What does His announcement in v18 mean for how you conduct your life and ministry?\n  What disrupting events have you experienced?\n  Is there something Jesus wants to disrupt in your life?\n  Is there something Jesus wants to disrupt in your church?\n  What are you doing about it?\n  Next time...Can we share with each other what we think Jesus is saying to us?\nListening To Jesus conference \u0026ndash; Session 5 (31/Oct/2020) Are We Listening? Welcome to the Listening To Jesus conference.Aim: To become a truly prophetic people who hear and obey our extraordinary Lord.\nIt is time to put what we have learnt into practice\nI'm not planning to teach this morning. It is time for us put what we have been learning into practice.\nPlease look back over the notes from the previous weeks and really pray about the passage and the questions I have asked.\nPlease be really honest about your answers and in our sharing next week. We all struggle to hear Jesus clearly. We are not here to pretend, or to compare ourselves with others, but to encourage one another and support and love each other. The Pharisees found it so hard to receive Jesus because they pretended to be better than they were. That is why it was the tax collectors and sinners that received Jesus \u0026ndash; they were not pretending!\nBut we also want to raise your expectations and confidence that Jesus really does want to speak to us, and it is worthwhile trying to listen. It grows as we practice and as we encourage one another to make listening a priority in our lives.\nWhat difference has this conference made to you?\n\u0026quot;You are worried and upset about many things, but one thing is needed\u0026quot;\nWhat is that \u0026quot;one thing\u0026quot; for you?\nWhat does Jesus want you to do about this?\n  In your own devotional life?\n  In your own Growth Group?\n  In your leadership role?\n  In your discipling of others?\n  In your church?\n  \u0026quot;My Sheep Hear My Voice\u0026quot;\nDo you expect to hear Jesus speak to you?\n  How does He speak?\n  When did you last really feel you had heard Jesus speak to you?\n  Were you obedient?\n  Has this conference helped you to listen to Jesus through scripture in a deeper way?\n What have you done as a result?  Has your attitude to being challenged or criticised changed?\nA Disrupting Visit\nHave you got so much invested in a particular form of church that you cannot risk letting Jesus speak?\nWhat does His announcement in v18 mean for how you conduct your life and ministry?\nWhat is Jesus saying to you now?\nJesus went on His Way\nJesus went on his way to the surrounding villages and towns, but the people returned to their synagogue.\nWhich way are you going?\nWhat does this mean in practice?\nMatters Arising... Should we spend all our time in \u0026quot;church\u0026quot;? Morris raised a very important point about people who say that to be a \u0026quot;Mary\u0026quot; means you need to spend all your time in church praying and fasting etc. and that those who are busy in the \u0026quot;world\u0026quot; working for their living are \u0026quot;Martha's\u0026quot;. We would completely disagree with this view. We are not meant to withdraw from the world and spend all our time in church. We are meant to go out INTO the world and carry the presence of Jesus with us. For most of us that means ordinary work. For some it may be in \u0026quot;full-time ministry\u0026quot;. But all of us can get distracted from what Jesus is saying to us, ESPECIALLY church leaders! We all need to cultivate the practice of listening to Jesus in all we do to make sure we are doing what He wants, and not simply what everyone else expects of us.\nHow do we teach others to listen to Jesus? James made the really helpful point that our job is NOT to tell people what they should be doing, or tell them what Jesus is saying to them, but to help them listen to Jesus for themselves so that they are obedient to Him and not just to us. A very good example of this is Phillip with the Ethiopian in Acts 8:30-38. The Ethiopian was reading Isaiah but couldn't understand it. So Phillip helped him to understand it for himself. The result was that the Ethiopian said \u0026ldquo;Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?\u0026rdquo; Phillip did not tell the Ethiopian what to do, he saw for himself. That is our task as teachers and disciple-makers; to help people understand what Jesus is saying so that they can hear and respond for themselves. It is NOT for us to tell people what Jesus is saying to them or how they should respond. That is the Holy Spirit's task.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"dd05ff1ab38f3fa16e47286c02e97083","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/listening-to-jesus-conference/listening-to-jesus-conference/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/listening-to-jesus-conference/listening-to-jesus-conference/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Welcome to the Listening To Jesus conference.Aim: To become a truly prophetic people who hear and obey our extraordinary Lord.\nListening To Jesus Conference \u0026ndash; Session 1 (03/10/2020) One Thing is Needful The last thing I encouraged you to do on our last visit, at our final gathering at Joseph's place, was to dream dreams.","tags":null,"title":"Listening To Jesus Conference","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Missional Communities \u0026ndash; Quick-Start Guide Missional Communities are how we obey the command to \u0026quot;meet together to encourage one another to love and good deeds\u0026quot; (Hebrews 10:24-25).\nSo once you have established some Growth Groups the next step is to make each member of the group the centre of a Missional Community.

They think that the more you gather the more successful you are. Our mentality is to go, go, go. Reach out. Create new Growth Groups, new Missional Communities, go to new villages.

For several years I have been saying that Jesus never told us to run churches, but to love one another and go and make disciples. In Jesus' ministry and that of the early church, both of these commands were worked out in deeply relational community. As a consequence we have been promoting Growth Groups as a very effective means of loving and making disciples.\nI now want to address a fundamental question: what did Jesus intend the church to look like?\nThe church is depicted by Paul as the Body of Christ \u0026ndash; each part joined in love and functioning in relation to the whole to embody Jesus in our communities (1 Cor 12). But generations of church practices have entrenched \u0026quot;church\u0026quot; as a producer / consumer relationship between the leaders and the congregation. In addition our consumer society has encouraged people to view church as a service-provider resulting in pick-and-choose and take-it-or-leave-it attitudes.\nThe relevance of the church has also been curtailed by reducing the Gospel to the Cross instead of preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom that Jesus told us to proclaim.\nTroubling Traditions Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!\u0026rdquo; Mark 7:9. We are often blind to our own traditions and jump to defend them when challenged.\nMany styles of church have been tried, including house church, Cell Church, Alternative Worship, Seeker-Friendly, concert-style, night-club style, Messy Church, Café Church and more. Each of these has started with the concept of a worship service and tried to find more culturally relevant ways of doing worship in the hope that non-Christians might be persuaded to come and see.\nBut even Christians struggle with church! In recent weeks I have had Christians from three different generations tell me that church is not working for them.\nHave we simply been following the traditions of men? Who said that a church gathering should be a worship service? What would happen if we allowed ourselves to completely reimagine church from the start? That is extremely difficult because the word \u0026quot;church\u0026quot; has generations of meaning behind it. So let's not even talk about church. Let's ban that word for the sake of this exercise, and instead let's talk about Missional Communities.\nMissional Communities We have already established our starting point in two important discoveries:\n  Jesus never told us to run church services; He sent us to make obedient disciples.\n  The Gospel Jesus preached was depicted by His life, not His death.\n  When we come to the Gospels to learn from Jesus about what a Missional Community might look like, we are struck by the observation that God the Father is the Great Missionary. This is not a story of men finding God, but of God seeking and drawing men to Himself. The whole bible proclaims this from cover to cover. That shows us that a Missional Community sees God and the world differently:\n  God is seen as the Missional God, reaching into our communities in manifold ways to set them free in His Kingdom.\n  Our mission, therefore, is to help our friends recognize how God is at work in their lives and to help them cooperate with Him.\n  So if God is the Missionary and our role is to \u0026quot;water\u0026quot; what God is doing, how do we do that? Jesus makes this very clear: live a Kingdom life and proclaim the presence of the Kingdom. In other words, love one another \u0026ndash; and love those who do not yet know Jesus \u0026ndash; and invite them to share in God's kingdom too. Therefore a Missional Community sees themselves differently:\n  The starting point is the formation of a culturally appropriate community, rather than a service. Sharing all of our lives in transparent honesty is our act of worship.\n  Our mission is to transform our society through demonstrating the Kingdom of God.\n  Gathering round a Breaking Bread Meal It's not too difficult to create small communities \u0026ndash; our wider communities probably have many already. In our village we have groups for craft, singing, running, walking, dancing, photography, book-swap, reading, cinema, football ... the list goes on. Some of these groups are run by churches or individual Christians. But how do we create a Missional Community?\nI feel that centring a Missional Community around the Breaking of Bread is important for several reasons:\n  Jesus commanded it at the Last Supper.\n  As a remembrance of His death it reminds us that God is the Father, sending His Son to us. And as the Father reached out to us in Jesus, so we also are to be an outward reaching community. Through us God reaches out to others in love.\n  As a proper meal, rather than a token meal, it emphasises to us that we need to feed on Him, just like we feed on the bread. We must eat and drink Him so He lives in and through us.\n  The meal has a past, present and future aspect. It looks back to the Cross; celebrates His presence with us now; and looks forward to the fullness of the Kingdom.\n  But here is a most important point that we tend to miss. Jesus said he would not eat again with his disciples until the Kingdom had come (Luke 22:18). And yet after the resurrection Jesus is recorded as eating again and again with his disciples.\nJesus was making the point that the Kingdom has now come. Our meal is therefore about the presence of the Kingdom. We live out the Kingdom and invite others to take part.\nAlthough traditionally the Breaking of Bread has been restricted to believers, there is no suggestion in the Gospels or the letters that the church should close its doors to unbelievers when sharing this meal. Indeed, the early church viewed the Breaking of Bread as central to mission. in In 362AD Julian II, Emperor of Rome, wrote this about the Christians: \u0026quot;These impious Galileans not only feed their own poor, but ours also; welcoming them into their agapae (their Breaking Bread meal), they attract them, as children are attracted, with cakes.\u0026quot; Pagans were invited to share in the Breaking of Bread meals and thereby came to faith. The agapae meal was a celebration and demonstration of God reaching out to a broken world in Jesus and through His death establishing the means of forgiveness and restoration.\nSimple churches around the world have proved how effective a shared meal is at creating community with not-yet-believers and make it an essential part of their gatherings.\nWhat does it look like? So if we start with the Jesus-ordained ingredient of the Breaking Bread meal, what else can we say about a Missional Community? Well I think we can agree it needs to be:\n  Enjoyable to the extent that people are enthusiastic about inviting others to come.\n  Jesus centred so that conversations about Jesus are easy to initiate.\n  Non-denominational, non-threatening and non-churchy as far as people's pre-conceptions are concerned.\n  Grow organically.\n  Beyond that, we will only discover what a Missional Community looks like by starting one. This is our suggested starting point:\n  Build community around sharing a simple breaking-bread meal followed by optional small-group activities (see later).\n  Use a minimal liturgical structure sufficient to make it clear what the meal represents to believers.\n  Encourage all to take part in short small-group discussion of a short passage of scripture before the meal.\n  Avoid unnecessary religious elements, such as singing and preaching and pretence.\n  What it Might Become You can have many different small missional communities in a community, each serving different demographic needs. They might meet once or twice a month \u0026ndash; or more often - (not necessarily on a Sunday) in homes or public places.\nThere would be a mix of Christian and not yet Christian people. During the breaking-bread meal people would be sharing their news and also their concerns and needs. After the meal, several small groups could form to take things deeper. Possible small groups might include:\n  A Parenting Course\n  A Growth Group\n  Prayer for healing or some other specific need.\n  Help with budgeting or managing debt.\n  Questions about the Bible or Christianity that people are struggling with.\n  Practical help or advice.\n  Learning and singing worship songs\n  \u0026lt;!-- --\u0026gt;\r  Agnostics / Atheists discussion group  What about our Existing Congregations? If Missional Communities prove to be effective then we must give them priority over \u0026quot;normal church\u0026quot; and they must become our new \u0026quot;normal\u0026quot;. We will probably want to find ways of gathering missional communities together from time to time, as Jesus leads \u0026ndash; but not to build up our own kingdom.\nThe Kingdom of God in Community Missional communities reject the producer / consumer view of church and embrace the call to live as a family joined in Christ. This family is where the Kingdom is expressed most clearly as family support is offered and relationship issues worked out rather than being ignored. The success of a Missional Community depends upon strong and transparent loving relationships. The real focus is on the relationships rather than the gatherings; gatherings support relationship, not the other way round. But Missional Communities are not inward-focussed; their community extends to their non-Christian friends and seeks to include them. Indeed, for some Christians in the community, their deepest and most transparent relationships might be with non-Christians.\nBecause of the central importance of relationships, the maximum size of a Missional Community is typically around 40 people.\nSo what does \u0026quot;church\u0026quot; look like? Church is a Kingdom-centred way of life, not a meeting. It is a body functioning with Jesus as the head. It's leadership and direction depends upon listening to and hearing Jesus, not following our program. It is loving and supporting and disciple-making. It is salt and light in its wider community. It is God's Kingdom evident on earth. It's a place where Jesus would go un-noticed because there are so many doing what Jesus does; a place where Jesus would want to be as a participant.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ac07f1b51ee48e6dab38f016ddf35128","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/missional-communities/missional-communities-vision/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/missional-communities/missional-communities-vision/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Seeking First the Kingdom - what should the church to look like?

I am aware that fresh interpretations of Paul, including my own, have caused controversy in evangelical circles, and particularly reformed circles. My own name has been linked with proposals which have been variously dismissed, scorned, vilified and anathematized. Having heard the papers yesterday morning and afternoon I suggested to David Searle that I should take two hours not one to say what needs to be said just now; but when I heard Tony Lane last night I realised I would need, like Cardinal Seripando at Trent, two days to establish my own orthodoxy. We shall see.\nThere are several different agendas coming together at this point. The issue is sometimes treated as a variation on old modernist controversies, at other times as a clash between a Christian absolutism and a religious relativism, and at other times as a variation on a perceived protestant/catholic divide (or even a high-church/low-church divide), with the so-called new perspective focussing on ecclesiology rather than soteriology and being condemned for so doing. And that\u0026rsquo;s just the beginning. From time to time correspondents draw my attention to various websites on which you can find scathing denunciations of me for abandoning traditional protestant orthodoxy and puzzled rejoinders from people who have studied my work and know that I\u0026rsquo;m not saying what many of my critics say I\u0026rsquo;m saying. Go to amazon.com and look at the comments which anonymous correspondents have appended to some of my books.\nFaced with that kind of problem, it would take a whole book to unpick the strands, to disentangle them from other issues, to explain what the so-called New Perspective is and isn\u0026rsquo;t, and to argue exegetically step by step for a particular reading of Paul. Clearly I can\u0026rsquo;t do that here. What I shall do instead is to make two opening remarks about my aim and method on the one hand and the problem of the New Perspective on the other, and then to attempt once more to say briefly what I think needs to be said about Paul and justification, sharpening up the issues here and there.\nFirst, as to aim and method. When I began research on Paul, thirty years ago this autumn, my aim was to understand Paul in general and Romans in particular better than I had done before, as part of my heartfelt and lifelong commitment to scripture, and to the sola scriptura principle, believing that the better the church understands and lives by scripture the better its worship, preaching and common life will be. I was conscious of thereby standing methodologically in the tradition of the reformers, for whom exegesis was the lifeblood of the church, and who believed that scripture should stand over against all human traditions. I have not changed this aim and this method, nor do I intend to. Indeed, the present controversy, from my own point of view, often appears to me in terms of a battle for the Reformers' aims and methods \u0026ndash; going back to scripture over against all human tradition \u0026ndash; against some of their theological positions (and, equally, those of their opponents, since I believe that often both sides were operating with mistaken understandings of Paul). I believe that Luther, Calvin, and many of the others would tell us to read scripture afresh, with all the tools available to us \u0026ndash; which is after all what they did \u0026ndash; and to treat their own doctrinal conclusions as important but not as important as scripture itself. That is what I have tried to do, and I believe I am honouring them thereby.\nAllow me, if you will, a moment of autobiography, for reasons similar to those of Paul in Galatians 1 and 2. In my early days of research, before Sanders had published Paul and Palestinian Judaism in 1977 and long before Dunn coined the phrase \u0026lsquo;The New Perspective on Paul\u0026rsquo;, I was puzzled by one exegetical issue in particular, which I here oversimplify for the sake of summary. If I read Paul in the then standard Lutheran way, Galatians made plenty of sense, but I had to fudge (as I could see dozens of writers fudging) the positive statements about the Law in Romans. If I read Paul in the Reformed way of which, for me, Charles Cranfield remains the supreme exegetical exemplar, Romans made a lot of sense, but I had to fudge (as I could see Cranfield fudging) the negative statements about the Law in Galatians. For me then and now, if I had to choose between Luther and Calvin I would always take Calvin, whether on the Law or (for that matter) the Eucharist. But as I struggled this way and that with the Greek text of Romans and Galatians, it dawned on me, I think in 1976, that a different solution was possible. In Romans 10.3 Paul, writing about his fellow Jews, declares that they are ignorant of the righteousness of God, and are seeking to establish \u0026lsquo;their own righteousness\u0026rsquo;. The wider context, not least 9.30\u0026ndash;33, deals with the respective positions of Jews and Gentiles within God\u0026rsquo;s purposes \u0026ndash; and with a lot more besides, of course, but not least that. Supposing, I thought, Paul meant \u0026lsquo;seeking to establish their own righteousness\u0026rsquo;, not in the sense of amoral status based on the performance of Torah and the consequent accumulation of a treasury of merit, but an ethnic status based on the possession of Torah as the sign of automatic covenant membership? I saw at once that this would make excellent sense of Romans 9 and 10, and would enable the positive statements about the Law throughout Romans to be given full weight while making it clear that this kind of use of Torah, as an ethnic talisman, was an abuse. I sat up in bed that night reading through Galatians and saw that at point after point this way of looking at Paul would make much better sense of Galatians, too, than either the standard post-Luther readings or the attempted Reformed ones.\nThe reason I\u0026rsquo;m telling you this is to show that I came to the position I still hold (having found it over the years to be deeply rewarding exegetically right across Paul; I regard as absolutely basic the need to understand Paul in a way which does justice to all the letters, as well as to the key passages in individual ones) \u0026ndash; that I came to this position, not because I learned it from Sanders or Dunn, but because of the struggle to think Paul\u0026rsquo;s thoughts after him as a matter of obedience to scripture. This brings me to the complexity of the so-called New Perspective and of my relationship to it.\nWhen Sanders\u0026rsquo;s book was published in 1977, I devoured it with both eagerness and puzzlement. Eagerness, because his exposition of first-century Palestinian Judaism supported in all kinds of ways the picture to which I had been coming through my reading of Paul (I was not, then, well up in Judaism itself). Puzzlement, because when he came to Paul Sanders seemed muddled and imprecise. This is partly, I now realise, because he was not dealing with theology (and so seemed confused about basic things like justification and salvation), but rather with religion, and patterns of religion in particular. His agenda, there and elsewhere, included a desire to make Christianity and Judaism less antithetical; in other words, to take a large step away from the anti-Judaism of much Pauline scholarship. I need hardly say that I never embraced either Sanders\u0026rsquo;s picture of Paul or the relativistic agendas which seemed to be driving it. Indeed, for the next decade much of what I wrote on Paul was in debate and disagreement with Sanders, not least because his proposals lacked the exegetical clarity and rootedness which I regarded and regard as indispensible. For me, the question has always been \u0026lsquo;But does this make sense of the text?\u0026rsquo;, not \u0026lsquo;But will this fit into some abstract scheme somewhere?\u0026rsquo;\nLots of those who joined the Sanders bandwaggon, not least in America, did so because they shared his post-Holocaust re-evaluation of Christian-Jewish relations, and the implicit relativism which that engendered. I have spent considerable energy arguing against this position, and explaining that Paul\u0026rsquo;s critique of Israel is not based on, or productive of, anti-Judaism as such, still less anti-semitism, but involves a far more delicately balanced and nuanced theology which cannot be reduced to such slogans.\nLikewise, when Jimmy Dunn added his stones to the growing pile I found myself in both agreement and disagreement with him. His proposal about the meaning of \u0026lsquo;works of the law\u0026rsquo; in Paul \u0026ndash; that they are not the moral works through which one gains merit but the works through which the Jew is defined over against the pagan \u0026ndash; I regard as exactly right. It has proved itself again and again in the detailed exegesis; attempts to deny it have in my view failed. But Dunn, like Sanders (and like some other New Perspetive writers such as John Ziesler) has not, I think, got to the heart of Paul. Again, much of my writing on Paul over the last twenty years at least has been in at least implicit dialogue with him, and I find his exposition of justification itself less than satisfying. For one thing, he never understands what I take to be Paul\u0026rsquo;s fundamental covenant theology; for another, his typically protestant anti-sacramentalism leads him to miss the point of Romans 6. I could go on.\nI say all this to make it clear that there are probably almost as many \u0026lsquo;New Perspective\u0026rsquo; positions as there are writers espousing it \u0026ndash; and that I disagree with most of them. Where I agree is as follows. It is blindingly obvious when you read Romans and Galatians \u0026ndash; though you would never have known this from any of the theologians we discussed yesterday \u0026ndash; that virtually whenever Paul talks about justification he does so in the context of a critique of Judaism and of the coming together of Jew and Gentile in Christ. As an exegete determined to listen to scripture rather than abstract my favourite bits from it I cannot ignore this. The only notice that most mainstream theology has taken of this context is to assume that the Jews were guilty of the kind of works-righteousness of which theologians from Augustine to Calvin and beyond have criticised their opponents; and, though Sanders\u0026rsquo;s account of Judaism needs a lot more nuancing, I regard the New Perspective\u0026rsquo;s challenge to this point as more or less established. What I miss entirely in the Old Perspective, but find so powerfully in some modern Pauline scholarship, is Paul\u0026rsquo;s sense of an underlying narrative, the story of God and Israel, God and Abraham, God and the covenant people, and the way in which that story came to its climax, as he says, \u0026lsquo;when the time had fully come\u0026rsquo; with the coming of Jesus the Messiah. How all this works out is still very controversial within the New Perspective. But at these points, for good exegetical and historical reasons, I find myself saying Here I Stand.\nWhat has happened, then? Like America looking for a new scapegoat after the collapse of the Cold War, and seizing on the Islamic world as the obvious target, many conservative writers, having discovered themselves in possession of the Pauline field after the liberals got tired of it, have looked around for new enemies. Here is something called the New Perspective; it seems to be denying some of the things we have normally taught; very well, let us demonize it, lump its proponents together, and nuke them from a great height. That has not made a pretty sight. Speaking as one of those who is regularly thus carpet-bombed, what I find frustrating is the refusal of the traditionalists to do three things: first, to differentiate the quite separate types of New Perspective; second, to engage in the actual exegetical debates upon which the whole thing turns, instead of simply repeating a Lutheran or similar line as though that settled matters; and third, to recognise that some of us at least are brothers in Christ who have come to the positions we hold not because of some liberal, modernist or relativist agenda but as a result of prayerful and humble study of the text which is and remains our sole authority. Of course, prayer and humility before the text do not guarantee exegetical success. We all remain deeply flawed at all levels. But that is precisely my point. If I am simul iustus et peccator, the church, not least the church as the scripture-reading community, must be ecclesia catholica semper reformanda. Like Calvin, we must claim the right to stand critically within a tradition. To deny either of these would be to take a large step towards precisely the kind of triumphalism against which the Reformers themselves would severely warn us. But if we are siblings in Christ there are, I think, appropriate ways of addressing one another and of speaking about one another, and I regret that these have not always characterized the debate.\nThere is much more that I could say under both these initial headings, but this must suffice for now. I turn to what I regard as the central issues around which the debate ought to turn.\n[Understanding Righteousness in Paul: The Central Issues]{.ul}\nLet me, as a good Calvinist, offer you five points about Paul which I regard as crucial in the present debates, justification itself being the fifth. There are of course many other things vital to Paul, not least Christology, about which I have written much; all of these need careful integration into the picture, for which now is not the time. Ideally, one would walk slowly round the piece of the Pauline jigsaw labelled \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo;, commenting on each other piece of the jigsaw and noting how justification fits into it. Obvious examples, each of which is dear to my heart and most of which I have written about elsewhere, are the cross, the resurrection, the spirit, the Jewish law, union with Christ, the sacraments, election, and love. Please do not think that because there is no time to expound any of these I am forgetting or marginalising them. And, again because of time, I simply state each point in the barest outline, relying on my other works, not least my recent Romans commentary, to back me up with details.\n1. The Gospel\nI begin where Romans begins \u0026ndash; with the gospel. My proposal is this. When Paul refers to \u0026lsquo;the gospel\u0026rsquo;, he is not referring to a system of salvation, though of course the gospel implies and contains this, nor even to the good news that there now is a way of salvation open to all, but rather to the proclamation that the crucified Jesus of Nazareth has been raised from the dead and thereby demonstrated to be both Israel\u0026rsquo;s Messiah and the world\u0026rsquo;s true Lord. \u0026lsquo;The gospel\u0026rsquo; is not \u0026lsquo;you can be saved, and here\u0026rsquo;s how\u0026rsquo;; the gospel, for Paul, is \u0026lsquo;Jesus Christ is Lord\u0026rsquo;.\nThis announcement draws together two things, in derivation and confrontation. First, Paul is clearly echoing the language of Isaiah: the message announced by the herald in Isaiah 40 and 52 has at last arrived. Saying \u0026lsquo;Jesus is Messiah and Lord\u0026rsquo; is thus a way of saying, among other things, \u0026lsquo;Israel\u0026rsquo;s history has come to its climax\u0026rsquo;; or \u0026lsquo;Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy has come true at last\u0026rsquo;. This is powerfully reinforced by Paul\u0026rsquo;s insistence, exactly as in Isaiah, that this heraldic message reveals God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness, that is, God\u0026rsquo;s covenant faithfulness, about which more anon. Second, since the word \u0026lsquo;gospel\u0026rsquo; was in public use to designate the message that Caesar was the Lord of the whole world, Paul\u0026rsquo;s message could not escape being confrontative: Jesus, not Caesar, is Lord, and at his name, not that of the Emperor, every knee shall bow. This aspect lies at the heart of what I have called \u0026lsquo;the fresh perspective on Paul\u0026rsquo;, the discovery of a subversive political dimension not as an add-on to Paul\u0026rsquo;s theology but as part of the inner meaning of \u0026lsquo;gospel\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;righteousness\u0026rsquo;, and so on.\nFor Paul, the announcement or proclamation of Jesus as Lord was itself the \u0026lsquo;word of God\u0026rsquo; which carried power. Putting together the various things he says about the preaching of the gospel, the word, and the work of the Spirit, we arrive at the following position: when Paul comes into a town and declares that Jesus is Lord, no doubt explaining who Jesus was, the fact and significance of his death and resurrection, and so on, then the Spirit is at work, mysteriously, in the hearts and minds of the listeners, so that, when some of them believe in Jesus, Paul knows that this is not because of his eloquence or clever argument but because the announcement of Jesus as Lord functions as (in later technical language) the means of grace, the vehicle of the Spirit. And, since the gospel is the heraldic proclamation of Jesus as Lord, it is not first and foremost a suggestion that one might like to enjoy a new religious experience. Nor is it even the take-it-or-leave-it offer of a way to salvation. It is a royal summons to submission, to obedience, to allegiance; and the form that this submission and obedient allegiance takes is of course faith. That is what Paul means by \u0026lsquo;the obedience of faith\u0026rsquo;. Faith itself, defined conveniently by Paul as belief that Jesus is Lord and that God raised him from the dead, is the work of the Spirit, accomplished through the proclamation. \u0026lsquo;No-one can say \u0026ldquo;Jesus is Lord\u0026rdquo; except by the Holy Spirit.\u0026rsquo; But this already jumps ahead to my fourth point, and before we get there we must take in the second and third.\n2. The Righteousness of God\nThe second point concerns the phrase \u0026lsquo;the righteousness of God\u0026rsquo;, dikaiosune theou. I became convinced many years ago, and time and exegesis have confirmed this again and again, that Paul always uses this phrase to denote, not the status which God\u0026rsquo;s people have from him or in his presence, but the righteousness of God himself. This is not to say that there is no such thing as a righteous status held by believers. There is. It is to deny that this is the referent of Paul\u0026rsquo;s phrase dikaiosune theou. Here a Pauline exegesis rooted in Paul\u0026rsquo;s own understanding of Jewish scripture and tradition must challenge the fuzzy thinking that, listening to yesterday\u0026rsquo;s papers, I discover characterised most of the great, but basically Latin-speaking, theologians.\nThe main argument for taking dikaiosune theou to denote an aspect of the character of God himself is the way in which Paul is summoning up a massive biblical and intertestamental theme, found not least in Isaiah 40\u0026mdash;55 which I have argued elsewhere is vital for him. God\u0026rsquo;s dikaiosune, his tsedaqah, is that aspect of his character because of which, despite Israel\u0026rsquo;s infidelity and consequent banishment, God will remain true to the covenant with Abraham and rescue her none the less. This \u0026lsquo;righteousness\u0026rsquo; is of course a form of justice; God has bound himself to the covenant, or perhaps we should say God\u0026rsquo;s covenant is binding upon him, and through this covenant he has promised not only to save Israel but also, thereby, to renew creation itself. The final flourish of Isaiah 55 is not to be forgotten, especially when we come to Romans 8. Righteousness, please note, is not the same thing as salvation; God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness is the reason why he saves Israel.\nBut this covenant-fidelity, this covenant-justice, is not purely a matter of salvific activity. As Daniel 9 makes clear, it is a matter of God\u0026rsquo;s severe justice upon covenant-breaking Israel, and only then a matter of God\u0026rsquo;s merciful rescue of penitent Israel. This is why the gospel \u0026ndash; the announcement that Jesus Christ is Lord \u0026ndash; contains within itself, as Paul insists in Romans 2.16, the message of future judgment as well as the news of salvation. What God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness never becomes, in the Jewish background which Paul is so richly summing up, is an attribute which is passed on to, reckoned to, or imputed to, his people. Nor does Paul treat it in this way. What we find, rather, is that Paul is constantly (especially in Romans, where all but one of the occurrences of the phrase are found) dealing with the themes which from Isaiah to 4 Ezra cluster together with the question of God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness: how is God to be faithful to Israel, to Abraham, to the world? How will the covenant be fulfilled, and who will be discovered to be God\u0026rsquo;s covenant people when this happens?\nThis is precisely what Romans 9\u0026ndash;11 is about, not as an appendix to the letter but as its proper climax. And this is anticipated in several earlier parts of the letter conveniently screened out by the great tradition in its quest for a non-Jewish soteriology, not least the second half of Romans 2, the first nine verses of Romans 3, and the fact that in Romans 4 Paul is demonstrably arguing about God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness to the Abrahamic covenant, not simply using Abraham as an example of someone justified by faith.\nPart of the tragedy of reformation exegesis, not least Lutheran exegesis, is that this entire line of thought was screened out. Thus even Käsemann, who sees clearly that dikaiosune theou must refer to God\u0026rsquo;s own righteousness, cannot allow that it has anything to do with the covenant, but insists, against the evidence, that it has become a technical term denoting \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;s salvation-creating power\u0026rsquo;, with a cosmic reach. He fails to notice a point I have come to regard as central and crucial: that the covenant with Israel was always designed to be God\u0026rsquo;s means of saving and blessing the entire cosmos. You get the cosmic reach, as in Genesis 12, as in Isaiah 40\u0026mdash;55, as in the Psalms, as in Romans 8, as in 1 Corinthians 15, not by bypassing the covenant but by fulfilling it.\nWhat then can we say about the status of \u0026lsquo;righteous\u0026rsquo; which, in many Pauline passages, is enjoyed by the people of God in Christ? For Paul, there is a clear distinction. God\u0026rsquo;s own righteousness is dikaiosune theou. The status of \u0026lsquo;righteous\u0026rsquo; which people enjoy as a result of God\u0026rsquo;s action in Christ and by the Spirit is, in Philippians 3.9, he ek theou dikaiosune, the righteous status which is \u0026lsquo;from God\u0026rsquo;. Ignoring this distinction, and translating dikaiosune theou as \u0026lsquo;a righteousness from God\u0026rsquo; or something like that, makes nonsense of several passages, most noticebly Romans 3.21\u0026ndash;26 (as, for instance, in the appalling and self-contradictory NIV!), where the great theme is the way in which God has been faithful to the covenant, the astonishing way whereby all alike, Jewish sinners and Gentile sinners, are welcomed, redeemed, justified.\nYou can see this most clearly if you remember the context of the Jewish lawcourt which forms the background for Paul\u0026rsquo;s forensic use of the dikaiosune theme. Despite some odd recent attempts to deny this, if you want to understand forensic justification you must go to the law-court and find how the metaphor works. In the Jewish lawcourt Paul would have known, there is no Director of Public Prosecutions; there is a judge, with a plaintiff and a defendant appearing before him. When the case has been heard, the judge finds in favour of one party and against the other. Once that has happened, the vindicated party possesses the status \u0026lsquo;righteous\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; not itself a moral statement, we note, but a statement of how things stand in terms of the now completed lawsuit. As someone said to me yesterday, it all depends what you mean by \u0026lsquo;righteous\u0026rsquo;. But this status of righteousness has nothing to do with the righteousness of the judge. For the judge to be righteous, it is necessary that he try the case fairly, refuse bribes or other favouritism, uphold the law, and take special note for the helpless, the widows, and so on. When either the plaintiff or the defendant is declared \u0026lsquo;righteous\u0026rsquo; at the end of the case, there is no sense that in either case the judge\u0026rsquo;s own righteousness has been passed on to them, by imputation, impartation, or any other process. What they have is a status of \u0026lsquo;righteous\u0026rsquo; which comes from the judge. Let me stress, in particular, that when the judge finds in favour of one party or the other, he quite literally makes the righteous; because \u0026lsquo;righteous\u0026rsquo; at this point is not a word denoting moral character, but only and precisely the status that you have when the court has found in your favour. If this had been kept in mind in earlier centuries a great deal of heartache and puzzle might have been avoided.\nWhat then about the \u0026lsquo;imputed righteousness\u0026rsquo; about which we are to hear an entire paper this afternoon? This is fine as it stands; God does indeed \u0026lsquo;reckon righteousness\u0026rsquo; to those who believe. But this is not, for Paul, the righteousness either of God or of Christ, except in a very specialised sense to which I shall return. There are only two passages which can be invoked in favour of the imputed righteousness being that of God or Christ. The first proves too much, and the second not enough. The first is 1 Corinthians 1.30f., where Paul says that Christ has become for us wisdom from God, and righteousness, sanctification and redemption. Wisdom is the main point he is making, and the other three nouns come in as a way of saying \u0026lsquo;and everything else as well\u0026rsquo;. \u0026lsquo;Yea, all I need, in thee to find, O Lamb of God, I come\u0026rsquo;; that line sums it up well. I doubt if this will sustain the normal \u0026lsquo;imputation\u0026rsquo; theology, because it would seem to demand equal air time for the imputation of wisdom, sanctification and redemption as well. The second passage is 2 Corinthians 5.21, which as I have argued elsewhere is not, as a matter of good exegesis, a statement of soteriology but of apostolic vocation. The entire passage is about the way in which Paul\u0026rsquo;s new covenant ministry, through the death and resurrection of Jesus, is in fact God\u0026rsquo;s appointed means for establishing and maintaining the church. \u0026lsquo;So that we might become God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness in him\u0026rsquo; means that in Christ those who are called to be apostolic preachers actually embody God\u0026rsquo;s own covenant faithfulness. I do not expect to convince you by this microcomsic summary of the point, but I submit that it deserves careful exegetical consideration, not dismissing with a wave of the hand and a reference to Brother Martin.\nIs there then no \u0026lsquo;reckoning of righteousness\u0026rsquo; in, for instance, Romans 5.14\u0026ndash;21? Yes, there is; but my case is that this is not God\u0026rsquo;s own righteousness, or Christ\u0026rsquo;s own righteousness, that is reckoned to God\u0026rsquo;s redeemed people, but rather the fresh status of \u0026lsquo;covenant member\u0026rsquo;, and/or \u0026lsquo;justified sinner\u0026rsquo;, which is accredited to those who are in Christ, who have heard the gospel and responded with \u0026lsquo;the obedience of faith\u0026rsquo;. But this, too, is pushing towards my fifth point, and I must proceed with the third.\n3. Final Judgment According to Works\nThe third point is remarkably controversial, seeing how well founded it is at several points in Paul. Indeed, listening to yesterday\u0026rsquo;s papers, it seems that there has been a massive conspiracy of silence on something which was quite clear for Paul (as indeed for Jesus). Paul, in company with mainstream second-Temple Judaism, affirms that God\u0026rsquo;s final judgment will be in accordance with the entirety of a life led \u0026ndash; in accordance, in other words, with works. He says this clearly and unambiguously in Romans 14.10\u0026ndash;12 and 2 Corinthians 5.10. He affirms it in that terrifying passage about church-builders in 1 Corinthians 3. But the main passage in question is of course Romans 2.1\u0026ndash;16.\nThis passage has often been read differently. We heard yesterday that Augustine had problems with it (perhaps the only thing in common between Augustine and E. P. Sanders). That is hardly surprising; here is the first statement about justification in Romans, and lo and behold it affirms justification according to works! The doers of the law, he says, will be justified (2.13). Shock, horror; Paul cannot (so many have thought) have really meant it. So the passage has been treated as a hypothetical position which Paul then undermines by showing that nobody can actually achieve it; or, by Sanders for instance, as a piece of unassimilated Jewish preaching which Paul allows to stand even though it conflicts with other things he says. But all such theories are undermined by exegesis itself, not least by observing the many small but significant threads that stitch Romans 2 into the fabric of the letter as a whole. Paul means what he says. Granted, he redefines what \u0026lsquo;doing the law\u0026rsquo; really means; he does this in chapter 8, and again in chapter 10, with a codicil in chapter 13. But he makes the point most compactly in Philippians 1.6: he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion on the day of Christ Jesus. The \u0026lsquo;works\u0026rsquo; in accordance with which the Christian will be vindicated on the last day are not the unaided works of the self-help moralist. Nor are they the performance of the ethnically distinctive Jewish boundary-markers (sabbath, food-laws and circumcision). They are the things which show, rather, that one is in Christ; the things which are produced in one\u0026rsquo;s life as a result of the Spirit\u0026rsquo;s indwelling and operation. In this way, Romans 8.1\u0026ndash;17 provides the real answer to Romans 2.1\u0026ndash;16. Why is there now \u0026lsquo;no condemnation\u0026rsquo;? Because, on the one hand, God has condemned sin in the flesh of Christ (let no-one say, as some have done, that this theme is absent in my work; it was and remains central in my thinking and my spirituality); and, on the other hand, because the Spirit is at work to do, within believers, what the Law could not do \u0026ndash; ultimately, to give life, but a life that begins in the present with the putting to death of the deeds of the body and the obedient submission to the leading of the Spirit.\nI am fascinated by the way in which some of those most conscious of their reformation heritage shy away from Paul\u0026rsquo;s clear statements about future judgment according to works. It is not often enough remarked upon, for instance, that in the Thessalonian letters, and in Philippians, he looks ahead to the coming day of judgment and sees God\u0026rsquo;s favourable verdict not on the basis of the merits and death of Christ, not because like Lord Hailsham he simply casts himself on the mercy of the judge, but on the basis of his apostolic work. \u0026lsquo;What is our hope and joy and crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus Christ at his royal appearing? Is it not you? For you are our glory and our joy.\u0026rsquo; (1 Thess. 3.19f.; cp. Phil. 2.16f.) I suspect that if you or I were to say such a thing, we could expect a swift rebuke of \u0026lsquo;nothing in my hand I bring, simply to thy cross I cling\u0026rsquo;. The fact that Paul does not feel obliged at every point to say this shows, I think, that he is not as concerned as we are about the danger of speaking of the things he himself has done \u0026ndash; though sometimes, to be sure, he adds a rider, which proves my point, that it is not his own energy but that which God gives and inspires within him (1 Cor. 15.10; Col. 1.29). But he is still clear that the things he does in the present, by moral and physical effort, will count to his credit on the last day, precisely because they are the effective signs that the Spirit of the living Christ has been at work in him. We are embarrassed about saying this kind of thing; Paul clearly is not. What on earth can have happened to a sola scriptura theology that it should find itself forced to screen out such emphatic, indeed celebratory, statements?\nThe future verdict, when it is positive, can be denoted by the verb \u0026lsquo;justify\u0026rsquo;. This carries its full forensic sense, rooted in the ancient Jewish belief that the God of Israel, being the creator of the world and also the God of justice, would finally put the world to rights, in other words, that he would conduct a final Assize. On that day there will be \u0026lsquo;glory, honour, immortality and the life of the age to come\u0026rsquo; for all who do right (Romans 2.7); in other words (verse 13) they will be justified, declared to be in the right. This ought to have highlighted long ago something which I believe has played too little part in discussions of Paul: justification by faith, to which I shall come in a moment, is the anticipation in the present of the justification which will occur in the future, and gains its meaning from that anticipation. What Augustine lacked, what Luther and Calvin lacked, what Regensburg lacked as a way of putting together the two things it tried to hold on to, was Paul\u0026rsquo;s eschatological perspective, filled out by the biblical fusion of covenantal and forensic categories. But before we get there I want to address a question which Paul seldom touches explicitly but about which we can reconstruct his thought quite accurately. This is just as well because it has played an important role in protestant discussions of soteriology and lies, I think, at the heart of today\u0026rsquo;s controversies about justification.\n4. Ordo Salutis\nI refer to the question known as ordo salutis. I take this phrase to refer to the lining up in chronological sequence of the events which occur from the time when a human being is outside the community of God\u0026rsquo;s people, stuck in idolatry and consequent sin, through to the time when this same erstwhile sinner is fully and finally saved. This question has been closely bound up with that of justification, but I shall suggest in this and the next section that when Paul uses the word and its cognates he has in mind one step only within that sequence, and \u0026ndash; critically, as you will see \u0026ndash; not the one that the word has been used to denote in much Christian dogmatics. At this point I am implicitly in dialogue with a general trend, at least since the sixteenth century, to make \u0026lsquo;conversion\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo; more or less coterminous; a trend which has been sped on its way when \u0026lsquo;conversion\u0026rsquo; is understood as \u0026lsquo;the establishment of a personal relationship with God\u0026rsquo;, and justification has been understood in a \u0026lsquo;relational\u0026rsquo; sense with the meaning, not of membership in the covenant as in the Old Testament, but of this personal relationship between the believer and God.\nI have already described how Paul understands the moment when the gospel of Jesus as Lord is announced and people come to believe it and obey its summons. Paul has a regular technical term for this moment, and that technical term is neither \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo; nor \u0026lsquo;conversion\u0026rsquo; (though he can use the latter from time to time): the word in question is \u0026lsquo;call\u0026rsquo;. \u0026lsquo;Consider your call\u0026rsquo;, he says to the Corinthians; \u0026lsquo;God called me by his grace\u0026rsquo;, he says of himself. (This is why, incidentally, Krister Stendahl\u0026rsquo;s suggestion that we should think of Paul\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;call\u0026rsquo; as opposed to his \u0026lsquo;conversion\u0026rsquo; misses the point. For Paul, the word \u0026lsquo;call\u0026rsquo; denoted not merely a vocation to a particular task but also, more fundamentally, the effective call of the gospel, applied by the Spirit to the individual heart and life and resulting in a turning away from idolatry and sin and a lifelong turning to God in Christ in believing allegiance.)\nBut if the \u0026lsquo;call\u0026rsquo; is the central event, the point at which the sinner turns to God, what comes before and after? Paul himself has given the answer in Romans 8.29\u0026ndash;30. Though he does not often discuss such things, he here posits two steps prior to God\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;call\u0026rsquo; through the gospel: God\u0026rsquo;s foreknowledge, and God\u0026rsquo;s marking-out-ahead-of-time, the mark in question being the mark of the image of the Son. (I translate with a paraphrase because of the problems associated with the word \u0026lsquo;destiny\u0026rsquo; within the word \u0026lsquo;predestination\u0026rsquo;.) These serve to emphasize, of course, the sovereignty of God in the call itself, while Paul never engages with the questions we want to ask about how precisely these things work out. (The closest he comes is of course Romans 9, which simply restates the problem for us; the parallel statement in Ephesians 1.3\u0026ndash;14 is a celebration rather than an explanation.)\nBut what matters for our purposes even more is the question of what comes after the \u0026lsquo;call\u0026rsquo;. \u0026lsquo;Those he called, he also justified\u0026rsquo;. In other words, Paul uses \u0026lsquo;justify\u0026rsquo; to denote something other than, and logically subsequent to, what we have often thought of as the moment of conversion, when someone who hasn\u0026rsquo;t before believed the gospel is gripped by the word and the Spirit and comes to believe it, to submit to Jesus as the risen Lord. Here is the central point in the controversy between what I say about Paul and what the tradition, not least the protestant tradition, has said. The tradition has used \u0026lsquo;justify\u0026rsquo; and its cognates to denote conversion, or at least the initial moment of the Christian life, and has then debated broader and narrower definitions of what counts. My reading of Paul indicates that he does not use the word like that; and my method, shared with the reformers, insists that I prefer scripture itself to even the finest traditions of interpretation. The fact that the Christian tradition has since at least Augustine used the word \u0026lsquo;justify\u0026rsquo; to mean \u0026lsquo;become a Christian\u0026rsquo;, whether broadly or narrowly conceived, is neither here nor there. For Paul, \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo; is something that follows on from the \u0026lsquo;call\u0026rsquo; through which a sinner is summoned to turn from idols and serve the living God, to turn from sin and follow Christ, to turn from death and believe in the God who raised Jesus from the dead. This points on to my fifth and final point, to which we shall come shortly.\nBut before that, we note that the final verb in Paul\u0026rsquo;s sequence is not \u0026lsquo;sanctified\u0026rsquo;. He would say that this has already happened to all baptised believers (see 1 Corinthians 6.10f.). It is \u0026lsquo;glorified\u0026rsquo;. Paul regards it as a fixed point that those who belong to the Messiah by faith and baptism already share his glorious life, his rule over the world, and that this rule, this glory, will one day be manifest. There is no time to develop this here, but I note, as a point which much dogmatics has yet to come to terms with, the fact that both Paul and John the Seer place great emphasis not just on being saved, not just on being raised from the dead, but on sharing the glorious rule of Jesus Christ as Lord over God\u0026rsquo;s new world. What this role will consist of, who or what will be in subjection under this rule, and so on, are questions which have fallen off most people\u0026rsquo;s radar screens. I suggest it\u0026rsquo;s time we got them back on.\nI hope I have said enough in this short section to convince you of two things. First, my understanding of how Paul supposed someone became a Christian is, I think, basically orthodox and indeed reformed. God takes the initiative, based on his foreknowledge; the preached word, through which the Spirit is at work, is the effective agent; belief in the gospel, that is, believing submission to Jesus as the risen Lord, is the direct result. My central point is that this isn\u0026rsquo;t what Paul is referring to when he speaks of \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo;. But the substance of what reformed theology, unlike Paul, has referred to by means of that word remains. Faith is not something someone does as a result of which God decides to grant them a new status or privilege. Becoming a Christian, in its initial moment, is not based on anything that a person has acquired by birth or achieved by merit. Faith is itself the first fruit of the Spirit\u0026rsquo;s call. And those thus called, to return to Philippians 1.6, can be sure that the one who began a good work in them will complete it at the day of Christ.\nSecond, it is simply not true, as people have said again and again, that I deny or downplay the place of the individual in favour of a corporate ecclesiology. True, I have reacted against the rampant individualism of western culture, and have tried to insist on a biblically rooted corporate solidarity in the body of Christ as an antidote to it. But this in no way reduces the importance of every person being confronted with the powerful gospel, and the need for each one to be turned around by it from idols to God, from sin to holiness, and from death to life.\n5. Justification\nWhat then is \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo;, if it is not conversion itself, not the establishment of a \u0026lsquo;relationship\u0026rsquo; between a person and God, but something which is, at least logically, consequent upon it? This is where confusion inevitably creeps in. I have argued again and again that Paul uses dikaioo and its cognates to denote something other than conversion itself; but several critics have not listened to this, but have imagined that what I say about Paul\u0026rsquo;s use of the dikaioo word-group is my proposed description of his theology of conversion; and they have then charged me with all kinds of interesting heresies. To make this clear, let me use instead a near-synonym, and speak here not of \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo; but of \u0026lsquo;vindication\u0026rsquo;, recognising that this is itself controversial.\nMy proposal has been, and still is, that Paul uses \u0026lsquo;vindication\u0026rsquo; language, i.e. the dikaioo word-group, when he is describing, not the moment when, or the process by which, someone comes from idolatry, sin and death to God, Christ and life, but rather the verdict which God pronounces consequent upon that event. dikaioo is after all a declarative word, declaring that something is the case, rather than a word for making something happen or changing the way something is. (Nor do we need to get round this, as many have done, by saying that when God declares something to be the case he brings it into being; that\u0026rsquo;s not the point here.) And if we work backwards from the future vindication I spoke of earlier I believe we can see what this declaration amounts to, and why Paul insisted on it, especially in Romans and Galatians.\nThe language of vindication, the dikaioo language, is as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen lawcourt language. Lawcourt imagery is appropriate because God is the God of justice, who is bound to put the world to rights, has promised to do so, and intends to keep his promises. But the means by which he will do so, from Genesis 12 onwards, is through the covenant he has made with Abraham; so that God\u0026rsquo;s covenant faithfulness on the one hand, and God\u0026rsquo;s justice on the other, are not two quite different things, but closely interlinked. Both are indicated, as we have seen, in the phrase dikaiosune theou. When we talk of God\u0026rsquo;s vindication of someone we are talking about God\u0026rsquo;s declaration, which appears as a double thing to us but I suspect a single thing to Paul: the declaration (a) that someone is in the right (their sins having been forgiven through the death of Jesus) and (b) that this person is a member of the true covenant family, the family God originally promised to Abraham and has now created through Christ and the Spirit, the single family which consists equally of believing Jews and believing Gentiles. I submit that this way of lining things up draws together the various categories which are otherwise left untidily around the place: forensic in Luther versus adoption in Calvin, lawcourt versus incorporative in Schweitzer and Sanders. Once you grasp Paul\u0026rsquo;s underlying covenantal theology these dichotomies are overcome. My first main point in this subsection is therefore that these two things \u0026ndash; declaring sinners to be in the right, with their sins forgiven, and declaring someone to be a member of the single multi-ethnic covenant family \u0026ndash; go very closely together in Paul\u0026rsquo;s mind, and that to point out the importance of the latter (belonging to the family) in passages like Romans 3 or Galatians 3 in no way undermines the importance of the former (being one of those now declared \u0026lsquo;in the right\u0026rsquo; in God\u0026rsquo;s lawcourt). The underlying point here is crucial: the reason God established the covenant with Abraham, according to scripture in general and Paul in particular, was to undo the sin of Adam and its effects and thereby to complete the project of the good creation itself. Thus God\u0026rsquo;s declaration of forgiveness and his declaration of covenant membership are not ultimately two different things. I freely grant that some of those who have highlighted the importance of the Jew-plus-Gentile point in Paul have used it as a way of saying that Paul is therefore not after all interested in God\u0026rsquo;s dealing with sins and putting sinners in a right relation to himself. But just because people draw false inferences one way, that is no reason why we should draw them the other way. Let me take two obvious examples.\nFirst, in Romans 3.21\u0026ndash;31, by anyone\u0026rsquo;s showing a vital and central passage, Paul makes what most commentators in the reformation tradition regard as a strange shift in verse 29, when he asks \u0026lsquo;Or is God the God of the Jews only?\u0026rsquo; (Notice how the NIV, for instance, omits the word \u0026lsquo;Or\u0026rsquo;.) If he had been talking all along simply about individual sinners being put right with God, we should indeed regard this as a sudden intrusion of ethnic questions. But he hasn\u0026rsquo;t. As chapter 4 will reveal, when we allow it to play its full role, he has been talking about God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness to the covenant with Abraham, and about God\u0026rsquo;s creation of a single family from both halves of sinful humanity. God\u0026rsquo;s declaring that sinners are now in a right relation to himself and God\u0026rsquo;s declaring that believing Jews and believing Gentiles belong in the same family are inextricably bound up with one another.\nThe same point emerges in Galatians 2.11\u0026ndash;21. Here, beyond cavil I think, the point of vindication is not \u0026lsquo;how someone becomes a Christian\u0026rsquo; but the question of table-fellowship: with whom may I, indeed must I, share table-fellowship? Peter\u0026rsquo;s action in separating himself from Christian Gentiles was not implying that they needed to perform moral good works; it was implying that they needed to become physically Jewish. Paul\u0026rsquo;s argument against him was not to do with the mechanism of how people come from being sinful idolaters to forgiven members of Christ\u0026rsquo;s people, but with the equality within the people of God of all who believe the gospel, Jew and Gentile alike. That controversy, indeed, dominates the entire letter in a way that, alas, I think Martin Luther never saw (though specialists may correct me).\nWhat then is this vindication, this dikaiosis? It is God\u0026rsquo;s declaration that a person is in the right; that is, (a) that their sins have been forgiven, and (b) that they are part of the single covenant family promised to Abraham. Notice that opening phrase: God\u0026rsquo;s declaration that. Not \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;s bringing it about that\u0026rsquo;, but God\u0026rsquo;s authoritative declaration of what is in fact the case. This is the point, of course, where some have accused me of semi-Pelagianism. That might be so if I intended to denote, with the word \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo;, what the tradition has denoted. But I don\u0026rsquo;t. Paul, I believe, uses vindication/justification to denote God\u0026rsquo;s declaration about someone, about (more specifically) the person who has been \u0026lsquo;called\u0026rsquo; in the sense described above. Vindication is not the same as call.\nAnd we now discover that this declaration, this vindication, occurs twice. It occurs in the future, as we have seen, on the basis of the entire life a person has led in the power of the Spirit \u0026ndash; that is, it occurs on the basis of \u0026lsquo;works\u0026rsquo; in Paul\u0026rsquo;s redefined sense. And, near the heart of Paul\u0026rsquo;s theology, it occurs in the present as an anticipation of that future verdict, when someone, responding in believing obedience to the \u0026lsquo;call\u0026rsquo; of the gospel, believes that Jesus is Lord and that God raised him from the dead. This is the point about justification by faith \u0026ndash; to revert to the familiar terminology: it is the anticipation in the present of the verdict which will be reaffirmed in the future. Justification is not \u0026lsquo;how someone becomes a Christian\u0026rsquo;. It is God\u0026rsquo;s declaration about the person who has just become a Christian. And, just as the final declaration will consist, not of words so much as of an event, namely, the resurrection of the person concerned into a glorious body like that of the risen Jesus, so the present declaration consists, not so much of words, though words there may be, but of an event, the event in which one dies with the Messiah and rises to new life with him, anticipating that final resurrection. In other words, baptism. I was delighted yesterday to discover that not only Chrysostom and Augustine but also Luther would here have agreed with me.\nTraditional protestants may not like this much, but it is I submit what Paul is saying. And I want you to notice right away, before I draw some broader conclusions from all this, three things that follow. First, Paul\u0026rsquo;s doctrine of what is true of those who are in the Messiah does the job, within his scheme of thought, that the traditional protestant emphasis on the imputation of Christ\u0026rsquo;s righteousness did within that scheme. In other words, that which imputed righteousness was trying to insist upon is, I think, fully taken care of in (for instance) Romans 6, where Paul declares that what is true of the Messiah is true of all his people. Jesus was vindicated by God as Messiah after his penal death; I am in the Messiah; therefore I too have died and been raised. According to Romans 6, when God looks at the baptised Christian he sees him or her in Christ. But Paul does not say that he sees us clothed with the earned merits of Christ. That would of course be the wrong meaning of \u0026lsquo;righteous\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;righteousness\u0026rsquo;. He sees us within the vindication of Christ, that is, as having died with Christ and risen again with him. I suspect that it was the mediaeval over-concentration on righteousness, on iustitia, that caused the protestant reformers to push for imputed righteousness to do the job they rightly saw was needed. But in my view they have thereby distorted what Paul himself was saying.\nSecond, it emerges that justification, for Paul, is not (in Sanders\u0026rsquo;s terminology) how one \u0026lsquo;gets in\u0026rsquo; to God\u0026rsquo;s people, but about God\u0026rsquo;s declaration that someone is in. In other words, it is all about assurance \u0026ndash; as we should have known from reading Romans. I\u0026rsquo;ve said it before and this is the place to say it again: if we are thinking Paul\u0026rsquo;s thoughts after him, we are not justified by faith by believing in justification by faith. We are justified by faith by believing in the gospel itself \u0026ndash; in other words, that Jesus is Lord and that God raised him from the dead. If, in addition, we believe in justification by faith itself, we believe that, amazingly considering what God knows about us, we are now and for ever part of the family to every member of which God says what he said to Jesus at his baptism: you are my beloved child, with you I am well pleased.\nThird, it follows at once that justification is the original ecumenical doctrine. The first time we meet justification, that is, in Galatians 2, it is about people from different cultures and traditions sharing table-fellowship on the basis of nothing other than their shared faith in Jesus as Messiah and Lord. Once we relocate justification, moving it from the discussion of how people become Christians to the discussion of how we know that someone is a Christian, we have a powerful incentive to work together across denominational barriers. One of the sad ironies of the last four hundred years is that, at least since 1541, we have allowed disputes about how people become Christians \u0026ndash; that which we thought was denoted by the language of justification \u0026ndash; to divide us, when the doctrine of justification itself, urging us to unite across our cultural divides, went unheard. Not that there are not large and important problems in ecumenical relations. I am horrified at some of the recent Anglican/Roman statements, for instance, and on things like the Papacy, purgatory, and the cult of saints (especially Mary), I am as protestant as the next person, for (I take it) good Pauline reasons. But justification by faith tells me that if my Roman neighbour believes that Jesus is Lord and that God raised him from the dead then he or she is a brother or sister, however much I believe them muddled, even dangerously so, on other matters.\n[Conclusion]{.ul}\nI have, I suspect, said enough to put the cat among the pigeons, but not enough to get it back into its basket. That will have to come, if at all, in question and answers. But let me conclude with four brief propositions about the importance of taking at least this version of the New Perspective seriously, and one flagrantly homiletic plea.\nFirst, to restate the point of method. I remain committed to understanding Paul in his own right and his own terms against all traditions about him, including my own. I remain convinced that Luther and Calvin would say Amen to that point of principle. And I believe, and have argued in my various exegetical works, that this reading of Paul makes far more sense of his letters, in whole and in their various parts, and in their mutual relations, than all other readings known to me. Part of that exegetical task is to relate Paul to the Jewish world of his day, and this reading I believe does that far better than the traditional one, though debates naturally remain about many aspects of the Jewish context.\nSecond, this reading of Paul allows fully for the challenge to each person to hear and believe the gospel and live by it, while at the same time allowing fully also for three other contexts, each of which is vitally important to Paul, to have their place. These three other contexts are the cosmic, as in Romans 8; the ecclesiological, as in his constant emphasis on the unity of Jew and Gentile in Christ; and the political, as mentioned earlier. Many have tried to play these off against each other; I believe they are instead mutually reinforcing. The united multi-ethnic church is a sign of God\u0026rsquo;s healing and remaking of the cosmos and also thereby a sign to Caesar and his followers that his attempted unification of the world is a blasphemous parody. This is part of what Ephesians and Colossians are all about, though that is another story. It is also, I believe, a point in urgent need of emphasis today.\nThird, this new perspective reading of Paul enables us to understand, crucially for some current debates in my church at least, why Paul is very tolerant of differences on some points (particularly food, drink and holy days) and completely intolerant on others (particularly sexual ethics). The boundary lines he insists on blurring (in, for instance, Romans 14 and 1 Corinthians 8) are precisely those between different ethnic communities, particularly Jew and Gentile. The boundary lines he draws the more firmly are those between the holy lifestyle required of those who have died and been raised with the Messiah and the unholy lifestyle of those who behave as if they had not, but were still living \u0026lsquo;in the flesh\u0026rsquo;. This, too, is urgent today.\nFourth, I discover an irony in the anti-New Perspective reaction in specifically Reformed circles. The New Perspective launched by Sanders and taken up eagerly in many American contexts was always a reaction, not to Reformed readings of Paul, but to Lutheran ones and the broader protestantism and evangelicalism that went along for the Lutheran ride, particularly in its negative assessment of Judaism and its Law. Had the Reformed reading of Paul, with its positive role for Israel and the Law, been in the ascendancy rather than the Lutheran one, the New Perspective might not have been necessary, or not in that form. For myself, it may surprise you to learn that I still think of myself as a Reformed theologian, retaining what seems to me the substance of Reformed theology while moving some of the labels around in obedience to scripture \u0026ndash; itself, as I have suggested, a good Reformed sort of thing to do.\nI end with a plea. I have lived most of my life in and around evangelical circles in which I have come to recognise a strange phenomenon. It is commonly assumed that Luther and Calvin got Paul right. But often when people think of Luther and Calvin they see them, and hence Paul, through three subsequent lenses provided by western culture. The Enlightenment highlighted the abstract truths of reason over against the messy facts of history; many Protestants have put Lessing and Luther together and still thought they were reading Paul. The Romantic movement highlighted inner feeling over against outer, physical reality; many have thence supposed that this was what Paul, and Luther and Calvin, were really saying (hence the knee-jerk protestant anti-sacramentalism). More recently, existentialism has insisted that what matters is being true to my inner self, rather than being conditioned by history, mine or anyone else\u0026rsquo;s; many people, not only Rudolf Bultmann, have read Paul and Luther in that light.\nAt a popular level, this mess and muddle shows up in a general sense that anything inward, anything to do with strong religious emotion, anything which downplays outward observance, must be striking a blow for the Pauline gospel of justification by faith. This is as worrying as it is absurd. All these movements are forms of dualism, where Paul believed in the goodness and God-givenness of creation, and in its eventual promised renewal. Together they reinforce that gnosticism which is a poison at the heart of much contemporary culture, including soi-disant Christian culture.\nIt is time to turn away from all this; to rub our eyes, and look clearly at the path by which we and our culture have come. It is time to turn back again, following the old sola scriptura principle, to the source and origin of one of the great doctrines of the New Testament: that when, through God\u0026rsquo;s effective call (sola gratia) in the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ (solus Christus), someone comes to believe that he is the risen Messiah and Lord, God thereupon (sola fide) declares in advance what he will declare on the last day when he raises that person from the dead: this person is in the right, their sins have been forgiven, they are part of the single, true, worldwide covenant family promised to Abraham, the sign of the coming new creation and the counter-sign to the boast of Caesar. Justification is ultimately about justice, about God putting the world to rights, with his chosen and called people as the advance guard of that new creation, charged with being and bringing signs of hope, of restorative justice, to the world. Let\u0026rsquo;s put the justice back in justification; and, as we do so, remind ourselves whose justice it is, and why. Soli Deo Gloria! Having thus stolen Luther\u0026rsquo;s slogans, I thought I might end with \u0026lsquo;Here I stand\u0026rsquo;; but let me rather say it in Paul\u0026rsquo;s language. hode hesteka; allo ou dunamai.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c5ded7bb5814148641ccc4a84eccb2f0","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/nt-wright/new-perspectives-on-paul/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/nt-wright/new-perspectives-on-paul/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"New Perspectives on Paul\nDelivered at the Tenth Edinburgh Dogmatics Conference\n[Introduction]{.ul}\nI am grateful for the invitation to this conference, and for the sensitive way in which the organisers responded to my comments on the initial outline of the programme.","tags":null,"title":"New Perspectives on Paul","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"It makes sense of Paul's positive comments about the law in Romans and his negative comments on Galatians.\nWhen Paul talks about the Jews trying to establish their righteousness through the law, he means establishing their membership of God's covenant people, by which they are justified - not their moral perfection.\nWhenever Paul discusses justification it is in the context of a critique of Judaism and the unity of God's people in Christ.\nThe gospel is always the climax of the Jewish covenant with Jesus as this world's true and only king and Lord. It is not \u0026quot;this is how you can be saved\u0026quot; but \u0026quot;Jesus is lord\u0026quot;\nGod's righteousness is his faithfulness to this covenant.\nPaul believed that the proclaimed that Jesus is lord is empowered by the holy spirit to bring conversion. It is primarily a summons to obedience. Thus, no one can say\u0026quot;Jesus is lord\u0026quot; except by the holy spirit.\nPaul's phrase, \u0026quot;the righteousness of God\u0026quot; (often wrongly translated as righteousness from God, esp in Rom 3:21-26) always refers to his faithfulness to the covenant, to rescue and justify his people. But it also includes his judgement of the wicked. Thus...\nRomans 2:5-7 But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. God \u0026quot;will repay each person according to what they have done. To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.\u0026quot;\nThis covenant faithfulness is why the gospel expounded in Romans leads from chapter 8 into chapter 9.\nJustification is not God imputing righteousness to us now, but pronouncing our belonging to him on judgement day on which we will be judged according to our works, which for a Christian, will be found acceptable. They are the works which demonstrate the life of the spirit in us. Phil 1:6. Those are the putting to death of the deeds of the flesh by the life of the spirit- Rom 8:1-17.\nNotice how Paul boasts of the evidence in his own life in the disciples he has made. 1thes 3:19, Phil 2:16.\n We are justified by faith in Christ in the sense that we rightly anticipate that future declaration because through faith in Chris as lord we are included in God's people.\nThe proper meaning of being justified is not to have righteousness imputed to us, but having a judgement made about us.\nGod does indeed count us righteous because we believe. But that righteousness is not God's righteousness, or Christ's righteousness, but the righteousness of being one of God's children.\nA person is saved by hearing the announcement that Jesus is lord, believing this to be true and giving themselves to obedience and bring baptised\nThis constitutes their call, as Paul puts it in Rom 8:29ff. And celebrates in Ephesians 1.\nAfter the call, on judgement day we will be justified and glorified.\n1 Corinthians 6:11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.\nRemember that Justification is a declaration of a fact, not its impartation.\nJustification by faith is the anticipation of that ultimate verdict. We can be sure of that verdict, because Jesus was vindicated in his resurrection, and we are in him. Rom 6.\nJustification is therefore not about how we are saved, but assurance that we are saved.\n Membership of God's people and final Justification are synonymous, one goes with the other. Hence\nRomans 3:28-29 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law. Or [is He] the God of the Jews only? [Is He] not also the God of the Gentiles?

He didn\u0026rsquo;t leave us with the Ten Commandments of Christ, indeed most of his instructions are hidden in his sermons and parables and don\u0026rsquo;t come across like commands. But there are two prominent exceptions.\n \u0026quot;My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.\u0026quot; (John 15:12)\n\u0026quot;Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.\u0026quot; (Matt 28:19)\n In view of these two great commands of Jesus, the motto of Life For Liberia is:\n\u0026ldquo;Love one another; go and make disciples\u0026rdquo;\nBlessed are those who hear my word and do it Throughout history God has struggled to get His people to hear and obey His word, and it has been the constant cry of the prophets for the people to turn back to the ways of the Lord. Throughout Jesus' ministry we see Him trying to turn people\u0026rsquo;s attention away from their religious traditions and make simple obedience to God their priority. We believe that God has called us to carry this appeal from the Holy Spirit to our friends in Liberia.\nOur cry and our message to you is to measure everything you do by these two commands of Jesus, and let that be the test of its value: \u0026ldquo;Love one another; go and make disciples\u0026rdquo;.\nUnhelpful Traditions Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!\u0026rdquo; (Mark 7:9). We are all guilty, in our efforts to establish churches, of the tendency to adopt traditions and copy practices that we see in other churches simply because \u0026ldquo;that is what churches do\u0026rdquo;. Instead, we should be testing everything against the scriptures and in particular the commands to love one another and go and make disciples. We must not assume that what we or others have always done is what Jesus is calling us to do.\nMy yoke is easy Jesus invites us to take His yoke upon us \u0026ldquo;For my yoke is easy and my burden is light\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 11:30). But sadly, we tend to lay heavy yokes upon believers through our traditions. For the early church it was the heavy weight of the Jewish traditions that had to be thrown off:\n \u0026ldquo;Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear?\u0026rdquo; (Acts 15:10)\n But what about us? As leaders in the Body of Christ we will have to give an account to Jesus for the burdens we have laid upon the necks of our people whom Jesus has invited to share His yoke. Take a moment to reflect on all we ask people to do and be committed to in maintaining our church buildings and running our church programs. Would Jesus describe this as an easy yoke and a light burden? Can we justify the demands we place on church members by the fruit it is bearing in obedience to the commands to love one another and go and make disciples?\nThe Gospel of the Kingdom Jesus and the apostles preached the Gospel of the Kingdom. We get a clear picture of this gospel from Paul\u0026rsquo;s account of what Jesus told him to do:\n \u0026ldquo;I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.\u0026rdquo; Acts 26:18\n The Gospel of the Kingdom is what we are called to preach. It has several clear elements:\n  I am sending you to them \u0026ndash; We must go out and not expect people to come to us.\n  to open their eyes \u0026ndash; We try to open their eyes so that they can see for themselves the darkness they are living in. This is done through asking them about their lives, listening to them and helping them to evaluate the things they put their hope and trust in. We cannot open their eyes by simply telling them what they should believe.\n  turn them from darkness to light \u0026ndash; repentance is a complete change of direction touching every aspect of their lives. It is to welcome and walk in God\u0026rsquo;s light, and no longer try to hide their behaviour in darkness.\n  from the power of Satan to God \u0026ndash; salvation is both turning from and deliverance from the works and ways and power of Satan. We must reject evil and African traditional spiritual practices. We need to be delivered from evil spirits and cut off every curse. We must stand firm in the confidence that as children of God, Satan has no power or hold over us.\n  receive forgiveness of sins \u0026ndash; Through our faith and trust in Jesus as the supreme King over all things in heaven and earth (Eph 1:20-23), and through Baptism in water and Baptism in the Holy Spirit (John 3:5) we are born-again and receive complete forgiveness of our sins. Forgiveness is given freely and completely in response to our faith in Jesus. Forgiveness is not, and never will be, given because of our efforts to live holy lives. See Hebrews 10:1-18.\n  a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me \u0026ndash; As disciples of Jesus we are welcomed by Jesus into His family, and He is not ashamed to call us His brothers and sisters. To be a disciple is to belong to Jesus' family and to give and receive love in that family. Because our hearts have been changed by Jesus, we will want to walk in the light and turn away from every kind of darkness. But however we may fail, we are secure in the love of God and in Jesus who stands as our righteousness before God.\n  This is the Gospel of the Kingdom which Jesus has commissioned us to preach. We are careful to maintain both the simplicity and the fullness of the Gospel. We do not complicate it with unnecessary explanations of theological truths, but neither do we reduce it to a simplistic appeal to come into the embrace of our loving heavenly Father. The only proper response to the Gospel is repentance, faith and baptism in water and the Holy Spirit. We cannot leave any one of these elements out.\nChrist in us, the hope of Glory (Col 1:27) The bible makes it very clear that righteousness is found in God alone. We try to be clear and consistent in teaching that our righteousness is based solely upon Christ. He alone is our righteousness. The accuser has been thrown out of God\u0026rsquo;s presence and instead Jesus stands in our place; and He is the Radiance of God\u0026rsquo;s own righteousness. The greatest hindrance to our own sanctification is self-condemnation and the condemnation of others (especially other Christians). We agree with Paul, that the starting point for our growth in obedience is that there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.\nIn our teaching and discipling our starting point is always Christ our Righteousness and the unconditional love of God for us. We minister and pray with Paul\u0026hellip;\n \u0026hellip; that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge - that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen (Eph 3:16-21)\n But that is not all! In Christ, God wells in us in His fullness (Eph\nI tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. (13) And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. (14) You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it (John 14:12-14)\nHealing and Deliverance Jesus made healing and deliverance central to His gospel message and told his disciples to do the same. In obedience to Jesus, we keep healing and deliverance at the centre of our proclamation and sharing of the gospel. No matter what the outcome, we keep proclaiming healing and expect God to act. We act in obedience to Jesus, not from fear of failure. But we don\u0026rsquo;t stop with healing. The Gospel is about restoring our relationship with God, and that is always our focus and goal.\nBaptism In obedience to Jesus, we baptise new believers in water as soon as we can. We encourage this to be arranged and performed as it was in the New Testament \u0026ndash; in a family setting (by the Growth Group), rather than as a church event. Baptism is how we share in Christ\u0026rsquo;s death and resurrection. It should include deliverance from all past spiritual involvement, curses, magic or superstitious practices, African or ancestral rituals, belief and practices. This includes deliverance from harmful experiences of the past from parents and all other people.\nBaptism in the Holy Spirit Water baptism is followed by prayer to receive the powerful baptism in the Holy Spirit. We dare not depart from Jesus teaching that unless we are born of water and of the Spirit, we cannot be part of God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom (John 3:5).\nJust as with healing and deliverance, we persist in praying for the transforming presence and power of the Holy Spirit for ourselves and for others, knowing that it is the Father\u0026rsquo;s good pleasure to give the Holy Spirit to those who ask (Acts 1:8).\nWe encourage disciples to practice the spiritual gifts of tongues (as a God-given means of building up our inner spiritual life) and prophecy (as a God-given means of building up the church). These \u0026ldquo;gateway\u0026rdquo; gifts help us to walk more deeply with the Spirit and explore the whole range of Spiritual gifts.\nDiscipleship as Apprenticeship One of the primary emphases of many churches is teaching. A great deal of time is spent both preparing and delivering teaching every week, and church members are urged to come and listen to all this teaching. We too are passionate about good teaching in the church, but we also believe that the emphasis on teaching in many churches is miss-placed. The problem is that most churches view understanding as discipleship, or they see teaching as the primary means of discipleship.\nBut Jesus did not say \u0026ldquo;teach them everything I have commanded you\u0026rdquo;; He said \u0026ldquo;teach them to obey everything I have commanded you\u0026rdquo;. Because of this we talk about discipleship as an apprenticeship. Discipleship is practicing doing what Jesus commanded us, and the only effective way to disciple another person is to demonstrate and practice obedience to Jesus.\nFor this reason we urge leaders to minimise the focus on teaching sessions in their churches and maximise their focus on demonstration. The teaching should be enough to provide understanding for the demonstration and no more. After putting the teaching into practice, the apprentices can be gathered for discussion and further teaching to support more fruitful obedience.\nTeaching and preaching should be a response to the demands of apprenticeship and its value measured against its effectiveness in motivating obedience to the command to love one another and go and make disciples.\nThe Body of Christ The Body of Christ is \u0026ldquo;joined and held together by every supporting ligament, growing and building itself up in love, as each part does its work\u0026rdquo; (Eph 4:16). This is the Holy Spirit\u0026rsquo;s description of church. It is not crippled and paralysed with non-functioning parts, the members are not in competition with one another, it is not held together by structures and programs and coercion but by every supporting ligament (the abilities that each one has). And it grows, not by leaders and teaching and programs, but by each part doing its work. And growth is not measured by bottoms-on-seats but by love.\nThe church, the Body of Christ, is the self-supporting family of disciples who love and care for one another and build one another up through all their varied gifts and abilities so that the Kingdom of God is made visible in their community. The Holy Spirit will guide the church in appointing leaders who will serve the church by keeping it focussed on the commands of Jesus to love one another and go and make disciples.\nWalking in the Light Being a Christian is not a show we put on, but the life we live. Jesus commands that we walk in truth and light before God and with one another. We reject pretence and rejoice that God is happy to have fellowship with us despite our failures. So we accept ourselves and one another as Jesus does. We accept Jesus' teaching that there can be no true fellowship between us unless we are open and truthful with one another. We try to be open and truthful and encourage others to be open and truthful.\nShared Meals Shared meals were at the heart of Jesus' ministry and He told His disciples to continue sharing meals (at the Last Supper). Traditional churches have abandoned this command, but we seek to be obedient. Shared meals are at the heart of our fellowship and our outreach. Shared meals lead into worship, prayer and ministry to one another. We invite others to join us where they can witness the love and fellowship between believers.\nA Meeting Place Churches have become associated with church buildings and this association has brought many problems. The message of evangelism has become \u0026quot;Go to church...\u0026quot; instead of bringing healing and deliverance into people's homes. Discipleship has become \u0026quot;Go to church\u0026quot; instead of listening to and obeying Jesus in our homes. Church-planting has become a matter of erecting buildings instead of planting groups of disciples. Church buildings are used to provide churches with a sense of identity and prestige \u0026ndash; \u0026quot;No one will take your church seriously if you don't have your own building...\u0026quot;.\nJesus said we should be a light set on a hill, not hidden away. When looking for a place to gather believers for worship, fellowship, shared meals and teaching, we look first for public buildings where believers are easily seen by the community and where non-members can easily come and see what is happening. The first choice would be a palaver hut or market area or some other open and public place. Perhaps a clinic or school may be usable, or a house with a large porch. If no such place is available we recommend approaching the community leaders and proposing that the community erect a suitable meeting place which the church can share.\nA church based on Growth Groups can grow and multiply and church plant without ever having its own building. Buildings must be seen as a luxury for communities that can well afford them rather than as a necessity for mission.\nSimple Church Our appeal and our vision is that we examine everything we do and everything we teach in the light of Jesus' two great commands and return to the simplest expression of church that is effective in fulfilling those commands. Anything and everything we add to the simplest expression of church must be in obedience to the scriptures and justifiable in terms of its effectiveness and fruitfulness in love and discipleship.\nOur vision includes regional and local leadership structures, eldership and apostleship, large and small church gatherings, church buildings, schools, theological training, helping the poor etc. etc., But our priority and starting point is discipleship through Growth Groups. We see these as the basic unit of church and the essential foundation for obedience to the commands to love one another and go and make disciples.\nOur approach is to build church from obedient disciples, rather than to try and make obedient disciples through our church programs. Our focus is therefore primarily bottom-up rather than top-down. We do not believe you need a \u0026ldquo;church\u0026rdquo; to make disciples; rather you need disciples to make a church. We start with disciple-making through Growth Groups, and then see what the Holy Spirit is saying about gathering Growth Groups into larger church groups.\nThe issue of church buildings is also important in Simple Church. Please see \u0026ldquo;How Church Buildings Cripple the Gospel\u0026rdquo; on the website for a discussion of this subject.\nA vision of the future   Growth Groups as the foundation and basic unit of church and discipleship.\n  Communities transformed through Growth Groups reaching out to their neighbours in love with the Gospel of the Kingdom, including healing and deliverance.\n  Believers baptised in water and the Holy Spirit, walking in the light and secure in their righteousness in Christ.\n  Discipleship primarily through active apprenticeship not listening to teaching.\n  The unity of the Body of Christ expressed through the regular gathering of believers together for a shared meal and prayer in obedience to Jesus command at the last supper.\n  Minimal burden on believers \u0026ndash; the simplest possible expression of church.\n  Minimal emphasis on church buildings \u0026ndash; use of existing facilities wherever possible.\n  Teaching sessions kept to the minimum and immediately put into practice through apprenticeship.\n  Multiplying many small self-governing churches in relationship together.\n  Leadership viewed as one of the many gifts given to serve the Body of Christ by keeping it focussed on loving one another and making disciples.\n  Leadership setting an example in apprenticing others and walking in light and truth with one another.\n  We hope and pray that you are inspired by this biblical vision for discipleship and will want to join with us as we seek to walk with Jesus our brother, friend and King.\nFor more details about Growth Groups and many other aspects of discipleship, see our website: www.LifeForLiberia.org.uk\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"61010db00f900b9ad5ef25efeb7c759d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/our-vision-for-simple-church/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/our-vision-for-simple-church/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Our Vision for Simple Church Obey My Commands Jesus did not make a big thing of commands.

Praying and singing may be helpful, but they are not essential ingredients of worship.\n\u0026quot;Discipleship is a Spirit filled person listening to and being obedient to Jesus that results in bearing fruit that endures to eternal life.\u0026quot; It is not learning about Jesus, or living a good and moral life, or faithfully attending church.\n\u0026quot;The church is literally the assembly, which derives from the governing body of a community.

Indeed, for most of us our experience is that most are not miraculously healed; mostly we heal naturally or through doctors, and some remain sick and may die.\nThe Christian response to this is usually to say that God wants some people to glorify Him in healing and health and for others to glorify Him in their joy and peace in their sickness.\nHealing cannot be separated from the Gospel Although it is undoubtedly true that God wants us to be thankful and glorify Him whatever our circumstance (see for example Philippians 4:12-13) I do not believe God wants us to simply accept sickness or a lack of healing as God's will. We should not simply pray and leave the answer to God \u0026ndash; instead we need to learn from Jesus:\n\u0026ldquo;Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 9:35)\nNone went home sick!\n Luke says, \u0026ldquo;God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.\u0026rdquo; (Acts 10:38)\n Jesus viewed His mission as healing and deliverance:\n\u0026quot;Go tell that fox, \u0026lsquo;I will drive out demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.'\u0026quot; (Luke 13:32)\nHealing is how Jesus demonstrates and proclaims the Gospel. In God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom, darkness is driven out by light and sickness by healing. Jesus commands us to repent and believe that His Kingdom has now come. Then He commissions us to continue this proclamation and demonstration. Jesus gives power and authority to heal, not just to pray:\nWhen Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. (Luke 9:1)\nThe Gospel accounts do not allow us to separate healing from the Gospel. We need be in no doubt that Jesus' will is that we should continue the proclamation of the Gospel of His Kingdom through healing and deliverance.\nPersisting In Faith The best way to please God is to have bold, courageous faith in His promises. We will never be reprimanded for too bold a faith!\n \u0026quot;You of little faith, why are you so afraid?\u0026quot; (Matt 8:26)\n But in the face of persistent sickness we really struggle. We tend to become fearful and anxious. Perhaps we give up praying for healing and try to accept the sickness, but more often we end up pleading with God to help us. Although this is completely understandable, and God sympathises with us in our weakness, it really is not a good option! Jesus says:\n\u0026quot;Do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words.\u0026quot; (Matt 6:7)\nInstead, Jesus tells us to keep praying in the assurance that God always hears us and He answers speedily; and that those to keep on asking and knocking and seeking will receive their request from their Father. (See Luke 18:1-8 \u0026quot;Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up...\u0026quot; and Matthew 7:7-11 - \u0026ldquo;Ask and it will be given to you...\u0026quot;).\nWe may not understand why we need to keep praying, but it is NOT because God is reluctant; we actually join in with God when we pray. Doubting is a miserable pastime whereas there is such joy and peace in believing:\n \u0026ldquo;Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 15:13)\n Getting Up Again My favourite definition of a righteous person is this, \u0026ldquo;He gets up again.\u0026rdquo; It comes from this wonderful scripture:\n \u0026ldquo;I will look to the LORD, I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me.

Leaders often have strong opinions about the doctrinal aspects because they are trying to deal with church members whose behaviour is sometimes troublesome. It is important, therefore, that we examine scripture carefully and try to let it instruct us, rather than simply try to justify our own beliefs.\nIn this study we will try to address two fundamental issues:\n  What and when do we need to confess and repent?\n  When and how are we made righteous?\n  Our Tradition Repentance has largely gone out of fashion in presenting the Gospel, in reaction to the puritan preaching of fiery judgement: \u0026ldquo;Sinners in the hands of an angry God\u0026rdquo;. It has been replaced by the appeal to God\u0026rsquo;s love: \u0026ldquo;If only you knew just how passionately God loves you, you would come running to His open arms\u0026rdquo;. A person responding to this gospel of love is then typically encouraged to pray the \u0026ldquo;sinner\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; prayer, asking for forgiveness for their imperfect character. They are then told that they are forgiven and now have eternal life.\nWe are then taught that to continue to be forgiven we need to keep confessing our sins and asking for forgiveness as often as we are aware of having sinned \u0026ndash; keep short accounts with God. We are taught that we are sinners, saved by grace and though we should slowly grow in righteousness, we will inevitably repeatedly fail in our struggle against temptation.\nSalvation Repentance So what do the scriptures teach about repentance for salvation?\n Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. \u0026ldquo;The time has come,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!\u0026rdquo; Mark 1:15\nRepentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations Luke 24:47\nRepent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out Acts 3:19\n\u0026ldquo;God has granted repentance that leads to life.\u0026rdquo; Acts 11:18\n We can see from these scriptures that repentance is to be preached as an integral part of the Gospel and as a pre-requisite for salvation. But what is not so obvious is the nature of that repentance. Mark\u0026rsquo;s quote above points us in the right direction. The \u0026ldquo;good news\u0026rdquo; Jesus proclaimed was \u0026ldquo;The time has come. The kingdom of God has come near.\u0026rdquo; The proper response to that news is \u0026ldquo;Repent and believe that the time has come and the kingdom of God has come near.\u0026rdquo;\nRepentance for salvation concerns our belief about the Kingdom; it is not focussed on our own imperfect nature:\n I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.' Acts 26:18\nFor he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. Col 1:13\nBut you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God\u0026rsquo;s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. 1 Peter 2:9-10\n Repentance, which means to change direction, is about turning from darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God, from the Kingdom of darkness to the Kingdom of Jesus, from being \u0026ldquo;not a people\u0026rdquo; to becoming a member of God\u0026rsquo;s people.\nThis is the biblical language of repentance for salvation. If we talk instead about lying, cheating, being selfish and unkind, being lustful or covetous, then we are directing people\u0026rsquo;s focus to their imperfect character rather than to the kingdom of which they are an unwitting part.\nTelling someone they will one day have to face a judge to answer for their wrong-doing may be true, but it does not direct a person to the kind of repentance that is required.\nA person does not need to be convicted of their personal sinfulness to be saved; they need to be convinced that their world-view is wrong. They are on their life journey, doing their best to make progress towards a better future. Then one day they meet someone who tells them they are headed in the wrong direction. If they are convinced, they will be hugely grateful! They will regret all the time and energy they have spent heading in the wrong direction and turn round and start heading in a new direction. Whether they are a great sinner or not is not particularly relevant.\nRepentance for salvation is a change of world-view, a change in our whole way of thinking. It is much more like changing political affiliation, or emigrating to another land. Indeed it is a change of religion \u0026ndash; from our former beliefs to believe that Jesus is God-become-man to bring us to the righteous and loving Father.\nThe sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer, therefore, should not be \u0026ldquo;I have sinned. Please forgive me\u0026rdquo;, but \u0026ldquo;I have been heading in the wrong direction; going along with the lies and deceit of the kingdom of this world. I want to turn from all that and follow the light and truth of Jesus, God\u0026rsquo;s Son\u0026rdquo;.\nSalvation Forgiveness We have seen that salvation repentance is kingdom-sized. In the same way, forgiveness is kingdom-sized.\n \u0026ldquo;Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out\u0026rdquo; Acts 3:19\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.\u0026rdquo; Col 1:13\n Salvation forgiveness is not concerned with individual sins, or our imperfect character, but with sin as a barrier between us and God. All our sins are wiped out; we receive forgiveness for all our sins, those past and those future. All are forgiven for those who become children of God.\n \u0026ldquo;Everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins\u0026rdquo; Acts 10:43\nFor by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.\u0026rdquo; Heb 10:14,17\n\u0026quot;In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace\u0026quot; Ephesians 1:7\n Salvation forgiveness is a New-Covenant promise of God. God is no longer sin-conscious towards those who are born again.\nFellowship Repentance Having repented for salvation, been baptised in water and born again by baptism in the Holy Spirit we are forever made righteous; cleansed and forgiven for our sins. Christ Himself has become our righteousness:\n For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.\u0026rdquo; Heb 10:14,17\nBut by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption. 1 Cor 1:30\nHe made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. 2 Cor 5:21\n There is nothing more that needs to be done for our sin. Jesus has already done it all:\n So Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him. Hebrews 9:28\n If we are totally and forever forgiven as children of God, what is the place of ongoing repentance and confession for a believer? Teaching about confession for Christians is often based upon a misunderstanding of:\n \u0026ldquo;If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\u0026rdquo; 1 John 1:8-9\n In this opening passage of his letter John is talking about the Gospel he has proclaimed to them; the Gospel through which they were saved; the Gospel that demands repentance from the kingdom of darkness to the Kingdom of light (v5-7). Those who deny their need for repentance are deceived, but those who confess their previous deception are made righteous (v8-10). Thus 1 John 1:8-9 are about a person responding to the Gospel and coming to faith; they are not instructions for believers (see \u0026quot;If we confess our sins...\u0026quot; at the end of this document). Instructions for believers come in the next chapter:\n \u0026ldquo;If anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father\u0026mdash;Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins.\u0026rdquo; 1 John 2:1\n Here there is no requirement for confession and repentance. We already have a full-time advocate with the Father whose atoning sacrifice is forever sufficient. We are not supposed to live with a continuing reminder of our sin. As believers we live in the wonder of continuing forgiveness because Jesus' death was sufficient for us. We are now to live in the joy of knowing that Jesus is our righteousness.\n \u0026ldquo;Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\u0026rdquo; Rom 5:1\nFor all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. Gal 3:27\n The Holy Spirits convicts unbelievers of sin, but His work for a believer is to convict them of their righteousness in Christ:\n Count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus \u0026hellip; You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness. Rom 6:11,18\nAnd now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming. 1 John 2:28\nIn Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every power and authority. In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self, ruled by the flesh, was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having cancelled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. Col 2:10-14\n Our conscience can condemn us even though we know God does not. The devil is the \u0026ldquo;Accuser of the brethren\u0026rdquo; (Rev 12:10). Paul warns us to guard against the fiery darts of the evil one by wearing the breastplate of righteousness (Eph 6:14). Whose righteousness do you suppose we wear? Ours? No! It is Christ\u0026rsquo;s righteousness that we wear. The devil wants us to be sin-conscious; God wants us to be Christ-conscious:\n Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. Col 3:1-4\n Do you feel Teflon-coated clean? All-the-time clean? That your sin and shortcomings do not and cannot make you dirty or give you a guilty conscience? That you do not need to confess your sins to God in order to draw near to him with joy and confidence? It is the work of the Holy Spirit and our responsibility as disciples to convince ourselves of these great biblical truths.\nWe need to know our sins are forgiven as a free gift, with nothing at all for us to contribute. But in order for us to have a clean conscience we also need to know that Christ is our righteousness. Our identity is Christ, not mucky me. My conscience is his conscience, my confidence is his confidence, my righteousness is his righteousness. We need to know this, not simply as doctrinal truth, but as a felt reality.\nWe do not need to confess our sins and ask for forgiveness if we are born again. If the Holy Spirit is living in us He changes our hearts so that we do not want to sin. But if we do, \u0026ldquo;we have an advocate\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; John tells us that when we belong to God and believe His truth, our hearts will be at rest and not suffer from condemnation:\n This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence: if our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him. And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. The one who keeps God\u0026rsquo;s commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: we know it by the Spirit he gave us. 1 John 3:19-24\n Although we naturally repent when the Holy Spirit does reveal sin to us, sometimes we become hardened to our sin and it takes some more drastic action from the Lord to confront us with our folly:\n It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? ...but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness. \u0026hellip; afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. Heb 12:7-11\n\u0026lsquo;Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place \u0026mdash; unless you repent. Rev. 2:5\n Holiness matters because we have turned away from darkness to Light and we want to walk in the light and truth. We want to enjoy fellowship with the Holy Spirit and with one another. We will want to talk to God about the areas where we fall short of God\u0026rsquo;s glory because we will want His help to grow more like Christ. We are likely to confess our short comings and thank Him for His grace and forgiveness.\nThe problem with seeing repentance as a daily requirement for dealing with sinful acts is that it encourages us to see our relationship with God as being performance-based. It feeds unbelief, self-righteousness and tends to make us compare ourselves with others:\n You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? \u0026hellip; Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh? \u0026hellip; Abraham \u0026ldquo;believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\u0026rdquo; Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham. Gal 3:1\n Sin consciousness stifles our growth. It hinders our fellowship with God. It leaves us with a tainted conscience which makes us feel dirty and unable to approach God with confidence. The boast of the New Covenant over the Old is that it gives us a clear conscience (at least it should do!):\n The Old Covenant sacrifices were not able to clear the conscience of the worshipper \u0026hellip; How much more, then, will the blood of Christ \u0026hellip; cleanse our consciences from dead works so that we may serve the living God! \u0026hellip; Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. Heb 9:9, 14, 10:22\n Fellowship Forgiveness There is a place for repentance, confession and asking for forgiveness: in our relationships with each other:\n \u0026ldquo;forgive our sins as we forgive others\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Matt 6:12\n\u0026quot;Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed.\u0026quot; James 5:16\n Sin creates barriers and difficulties between believers:\n But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin. 1 John 1:7\n\u0026ldquo;Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. Matt 18:15\n If we have turned from the kingdom of darkness to the Kingdom of Light, we will want to walk in light and truth with one another. We will want to deal with any relationship issues that arise between us and we will be gracious and merciful in response to the grace and mercy we have received from Jesus.\n Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you. Eph 4:32\nTherefore, as God\u0026rsquo;s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. Col 3:12-13\n Discipleship Discipleship is about believing God, trusting His promises and living out the life of confident faith He calls us to. For us to do this, we need to be far more conscious of Christ in us than sin in us. Constant reminders of our sin do nothing to help us move in the power of the Holy Spirit.\nLook over the scriptures quoted in this study and ask yourself \u0026ldquo;What is the Spirit trying to convince me of?\u0026rdquo;\nWe need to fix our eyes on Jesus, His righteousness, His indwelling presence, His favour, His promises:\n I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord\u0026rsquo;s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge\u0026mdash;that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen. Eph 3:16-21\n If we confess our sins... John's use of the word \u0026quot;we\u0026quot; in \u0026quot;If we confess our sins...\u0026quot;(1 John 1v9) has led many to think that John is saying that Christians should confess their sins. But if we follow John's argument through, and notice how he uses \u0026quot;we\u0026quot; then we can see he must be talking about unbelievers coming to faith.\nFrom vv1-5 John clearly means himself and his fellow apostles when he uses \u0026quot;we\u0026quot;. But in v6 he writes:\n \u0026quot;If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.\u0026quot;\n Here, John cannot possibly be meaning himself when he writes \u0026quot;we\u0026quot;. He is using \u0026quot;we\u0026quot; to imagine himself in the shoes of an unbeliever. In v7 he continues to imagine himself as that unbeliever coming into the light of the Gospel:\n \u0026quot;But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.\u0026quot;\n In v8 and v10 it is again clear that he uses \u0026quot;we\u0026quot; to imagine an unbeliever, but this time one who rejects the light:\n \u0026quot;If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.\u0026quot; ... \u0026quot;If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.\u0026quot;\n So that leaves us with the \u0026quot;we\u0026quot; in v9:\n \u0026quot;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\u0026quot;\n Who is John meaning by \u0026quot;we\u0026quot;? Well, in both the preceding and following sentences he clearly means an unbeliever who has encountered the Gospel of Light \u0026ndash; one who either accepts or rejects the message. It makes no sense at all for John to suddenly be talking about Christians at this point. It is obviously the same people he has in mind since v6: unbelievers encountering the Gospel who either reject the idea that they are sinners in need of forgiveness, or who confess their need to Jesus and turn to Him for saving forgiveness. V9 is about what happens when a person comes out of darkness into the light. Chapter 2 is about living as a believer. There, the answer to our ongoing sin is the eternal advocacy and sufficiency of Jesus - see especially 2:1-2 and 2:12.\nSo, in conclusion, this famous passage in John's letter is NOT an instruction to believers to keep confessing their sin, but an instruction to unbelievers coming to faith. God does not want us to keep remembering our sin. He has forgiven it. He wants us to remember and celebrate Christ who is our righteousness \u0026ndash; \u0026quot;Set your minds on things above, not on things below\u0026quot; Colossians 3:1-3.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7dc04d1974f0750881109ac674639e57","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/repentance-and-righteousness/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/repentance-and-righteousness/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Repentance and Righteousness Stephen Dolley, Dec 2018 Introduction Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!\u0026rdquo; Mark 7:9.","tags":null,"title":"Repentance and Righteousness","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Righteousness\n(Originally published in New Dictionary of Theology. David F. Wright, Sinclair B. Ferguson, J.I. Packer (eds), 590-592. IVP. Reproduced by permission of the author.)\nRighteousness. The basic meaning of \u0026lsquo;righteousness\u0026rsquo; and its cognates in the Bible derives from the Hebrew sedeq, which was usually translated in the LXX as dikaiosynē. It thus denotes not so much the abstract idea of justice or virtue, as right standing and consequent right behaviour, within a community. English translates this semantic field with two different roots: \u0026lsquo;right\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;righteous\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;righteousness\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;just\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;justice\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;justify\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo;. In Heb. and Gk., however, these ideas all belong together linguistically and theologically.\nIn the OT (upon which the NT idea is based) two fields of thought give specific shape to the idea:\n  The lawcourt setting gives \u0026lsquo;righteousness\u0026rsquo; the idea of the standing\n of a person in relation to the court\u0026rsquo;s decision.In the Hebrew court there were no public prosecutors: all cases had to be brought by a plaintiff against a defendant. Righteousness is the status which results, for either party, if the court finds in his favour. Since the standard of judgment is the covenant law of God, \u0026lsquo;righteousness\u0026rsquo; can acquire the sense of \u0026lsquo;behaviour in conformity with the covenant requirements\u0026rsquo;, bringing about the possibility that right covenant standing can be observed in ordinary behaviour. In addition, the judge, or king, must conform to a different sense of righteousness: he must try cases fairly, i.e. he must be true to the law and/or the covenant, must condemn evil, show no partiality, and uphold the cause of the defenceless. This complex meaning explains the occasional instances when the Septuagint uses dikaiosynē to translate not sedeq and its cognates but other roots such as hesed (grace, covenant mercy), mišpāt (judgment, justice), etc.\n   The covenantal setting merges with that of the lawcourt: this is due\n partly to the fact that the law (Torah) is the covenant charter.Though sometimes God himself is seen as Israel\u0026rsquo;s adversary at law, the more frequently encountered picture is of God as judge or king, with Israel as either plaintiff (pleading her cause against her enemies) or defendant (on trial for failure to keep the covenant). God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness is then invoked as the reason why he can be expected to deliver his people: he is committed by covenant to do so. When this is apparently called into question (in the exile, and later in the Maccabean revolt and the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70), the writers of these periods reply that God is righteous in judging his sinful people; that he is righteous in waiting before judging their enemies, granting time for repentance; and that he will show himself righteous in restoring the: fortunes of his people, in renewing the covenant (Dn. 9; Ezr. 9; etc.). The book of Job can be seen as a long lawcourt scene in which Job pleads his righteousness, imagining that God is his adversary, only to discover that God cannot be brought into court: the first two chapters reveal Satan (see Devil) as the real prosecutor, with Job\u0026rsquo;s comforters as his unwitting assistants.\n   These two settings (lawcourt and covenant) combine to produce the developed covenantal theology which underlay Judaism at the time of Jesus. To have \u0026lsquo;righteousness\u0026rsquo; meant to belong to the covenant, the boundary marker of which was the Torah, and the hope of which was that God, in accordance with his own righteousness, would act in history to \u0026lsquo;vindicate\u0026rsquo;, to \u0026lsquo;justify\u0026rsquo;, his people (i.e. to show that they really were his people) by saving them from their enemies. These meanings are reflected particularly in Matthew, where \u0026lsquo;righteousness\u0026rsquo; is shorthand both for the saving plan of God (Mt. 3:15) and for the covenantal obligations of his people (5:20; 6:1), and Luke, which emphasizes the \u0026lsquo;righteous\u0026rsquo; standing of many of the key actors in the drama (Lk. 1:6; 2:25; 23:50; Acts 10:22). Jesus himself is sometimes called \u0026lsquo;the righteous one\u0026rsquo;, in virtue of his being the one designated by God as his true covenant partner (e.g. Acts 3:14; 7:52, 22:14, Jas. 5:6). The Jewish belief that God would judge the world justly is echoed repeatedly in the NT, e.g. 2 Thes. 1:5-6; Rom. 2:1-16; Heb. 12:23. But the fullest development comes in Paul, particularly with his exposition in Romans of the righteousness of God.\nPaul saw that the Jewish problem of God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness (if the creator of the world is Israel\u0026rsquo;s covenant God, why is Israel still oppressed?) had been answered in a new and striking way in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The answer had, in fact, forced a restatement of the question, demonstrating as it did the universal sinfulness of Jews as well as pagans. The gospel, Paul declares, proves that God is in the right despite appearances: he has kept covenant with Abraham, has dealt properly with sin, has acted and will act without partiality, and upholds all those who cast themselves, helpless, on his mercy (Rom. 1:16-17; 2:1-16; 3:21 \u0026ndash; 4:25). God has, in other words, shown \u0026lsquo;righteousness\u0026rsquo; in the sense appropriate for the judge and the Lord of the covenant. He is thus able to anticipate the verdict of the last day (Rom. 2:1-16) and to declare in the present (Rom. 3:21-26) that all who believe the gospel are already within the covenant community (see Justification).\nThe view that \u0026lsquo;the righteousness of God\u0026rsquo; refers to a righteousness which God gives to, bestows upon, or recognizes in human beings came initially from Augustine, but gained its force (in terms of the development of modern theology) from Luther\u0026rsquo;s reaction against a iustitia distributiva. The term iustitia, as found in the Latin Vulgate, had indeed pulled the understanding of texts such as Rom. 1:17 in the (false) direction of a merely \u0026lsquo;distributive\u0026rsquo; justice, in which God simply rewards virtue and punishes vice. Luther\u0026rsquo;s alternative, however fruitful in opening new worlds of theology to him, was in some ways equally misleading, for it directed attention away from the biblical notion of God\u0026rsquo;s covenant faithfulness and instead placed greater emphasis upon the status of the human being. In the period after Luther, Protestant theology largely returned to the notion of the distributive justice of God: because God is righteous, he must in fact reward virtue and punish sin, and this satisfaction of divine justice took place in Christ.\nAccording to the NT, the people of God do indeed have \u0026lsquo;righteousness\u0026rsquo;. This is not, strictly speaking, God\u0026rsquo;s own righteousness (though cf. 2 Cor. 5:21), but that which is proper to the person in whose favour the court has found; within the covenant context, it is the right standing of a member of the people of God. \u0026lsquo;Righteousness\u0026rsquo; thus comes to mean, more or less, \u0026lsquo;covenant membership\u0026rsquo;, with all the overtones of appropriate behaviour (e.g. Phil. 1:11). The terminology plays a central role in Paul\u0026rsquo;s debate with those who sought to keep the covenant community within the bounds of physical Judaism: they, Paul says, are ignorant of God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness (i.e. of what God is righteously accomplishing, of how he is fulfilling his covenant) and are seeking to establish a righteousness of their own (i.e. a covenant membership for Jews alone), whereas in God\u0026rsquo;s plan Christ offers covenant membership to all who believe the gospel (Rom. 10:3-4). (See further Paul.)\nThe central biblical discussions of righteousness thus principally concern membership in the covenant and the behaviour appropriate to that membership. Since, however, these passages depend on a theology in which God is creator and judge of all the earth, and in which God\u0026rsquo;s people are to reflect God\u0026rsquo;s own character, it is not illegitimate to extrapolate from them to the \u0026lsquo;justice\u0026rsquo; which God desires, and designs, for his world. The church is to be not only an example of God\u0026rsquo;s intended new humanity, but the means by which the eventual plan, including the establishment of world-wide justice, is to be put into effect. Lack of emphasis here in older theological writing, due sometimes to individualism and sometimes to a dualistic split between church and world, has led to a reaction (e.g. in some liberation theology) in which \u0026lsquo;justice\u0026rsquo; as an abstract virtue has been elevated in an unbiblical manner (e.g. at the expense of mercy). This should not prevent a balanced orthodox view of world-wide justice from regaining, and retaining, its place in the church\u0026rsquo;s teaching and practice.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9ad05ab27e5cb6a8e98e744ad5429eb3","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/nt-wright/righteousness/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/nt-wright/righteousness/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Righteousness\n(Originally published in New Dictionary of Theology. David F.

Revd. Prof. N T Wright DD FRSE\nSt Mellitus' College, London\nOctober 17 2016\n The deft artistry and fathomless theology of John\u0026rsquo;s gospel is powerfully displayed in the footwashing scene in chapter 13. In a few strokes of the pen we are offered a tableau intimate and touching on the one hand and scary and dangerous on the other. Having begun his masterpiece with the all-creative Word becoming flesh and revealing God\u0026rsquo;s glory \u0026ndash; we shall return to his Prologue in a little while \u0026ndash; John begins the shorter second half of his gospel with an acted parable of the same thing. Jesus removes his outer garments and kneels down to wash the disciples' feet, summing up all that is to come in the astonishing act of divine humility, of loving redemption, of cleansing for service. This is a good place to begin this evening\u0026rsquo;s quest for a fresh glimpse of what we in the Western churches have traditionally called \u0026lsquo;the atonement\u0026rsquo;, my subject for tonight. For John, as indeed throughout the New Testament, Jesus' vocation to rescue the world from its plight and in so doing to reveal the divine glory in action is focused, symbolized, encoded in an action simultaneously dramatic, fraught with cosmic significance, and gentle, tender with human emotion. If you want to understand the great mysteries of Christian theology, of Trinity, Incarnation, and atonement itself, you could do worse than spend time with this scene.\n\u0026lsquo;Having loved his own who were in the world\u0026rsquo;, John begins, \u0026lsquo;Jesus loved them to the end, to the uttermost\u0026rsquo;. Here we see what it means that \u0026lsquo;God so loved the world that he gave his only son\u0026rsquo;: a love at once powerful, humble, sovereign and sensitive. As always, Jesus surprises his followers, as he was to do even more devastatingly at the climax of the story the following day. Peter tries to object \u0026ndash; a Johannine equivalent, in a sense, of Peter\u0026rsquo;s protest in Matthew 16 \u0026ndash; and Jesus waves away the objection: If I don\u0026rsquo;t wash you, he says, you have no part in me. This produces a typically Petrine over-reaction: well then, says Peter, not my feet only, but my hands and my head. Calm down, says Jesus: you are already clean, because I have washed you, and all you now need is the regular footwashing \u0026ndash; a wonderful image in itself of the prior whole-person washing of the gospel itself, needing only the regular smaller-scale washing of dusty feet, but like everything else in John\u0026rsquo;s story pointing forwards to the great saving act to come in which the filth and mire of the centuries would be washed away in the torrent of water and blood. And then Jesus resumes his garments and explains at least the surface layer of meaning: as I have done this to you, you should do it for one another. As usual John gives the simple explanation in order to nudge his readers into the deeper ones, but this already points forward to the ministries of the gospel which will be unleashed through the outpoured Spirit in John 20: As the Father sent me, so I send you. Atonement then; atonement now. The theology of the cross is only ultimately complete when it issues in the footwashing and fruitbearing mission of Jesus' followers. That is part of the point of the long discourses which follow chapter 13 and thereby prepare the way for the dramatic scene before Pilate and on the cross itself.\nInto this scene of prophetic action and symbolic power John has woven the dark strand which explains why all this is necessary and how the great redemption is to be accomplished. The accuser, he says, had already put it into Judas\u0026rsquo;s heart to betray Jesus. The accuser \u0026ndash; the satan \u0026ndash; is the dark, sub-personal force that has dogged Jesus' footsteps throughout his mission, rather as Gollum is never far away while Frodo and his companions undertake their fateful journey; and, indeed, I rather think Tolkein was tracking a profound biblical theme in that strand of his master-narrative, including its final denouement. Jesus knows of course that the satan would do this, and had already hinted that one of his own followers would act out the great Accusation, the charge that would take him to his death. It isn\u0026rsquo;t just that Judas is succumbing to a miscellaneous temptation; rather, the hate and shame of all the world, the raging howl that rises from all the accumulated forces of evil, of anti-creation, of tyranny and spite and sneering and lies, has gathered itself into one and has focused its deadly spotlight on the enfleshed Word, the living embodiment of the loving and wise creator. And love only makes it worse; it is after the footwashing, where Jesus warns that \u0026lsquo;you are already clean, though not all of you\u0026rsquo;, that the satan finally enters into Judas. \u0026lsquo;Do it quickly,\u0026rsquo; says Jesus; and Judas goes out into the night. People sometimes say that St Luke was an artist; but if ever a biblical scene had all the elements of a great canvas, holding many different characters and moods within a single tableau, it is this footwashing scene in John 13.\nI begin with this scene partly because, knowing it will be impossible in one lecture to say very much of what I have tried to say in the book (which turned out to be much longer than I had expected or intended), I want at least to stir your imaginations so that your reflection on Jesus' crucifixion is not a matter of theories, of schemes of thought to be played off against one another, but a matter of vivid historical reality captured in a story like the footwashing, as indeed in so many others, but with this one positioned with deliberate care by John to launch the final moves that will take us to the foot of the cross, and on, beyond, to the fresh morning in the garden and the warm breath of the outpoured Spirit. We will come presently and briefly to the theories, but the theories mean what they mean as interpretations of the story, the real-life narrative of the word made flesh, of the flesh made shameful, of the shame itself killed and buried. The theories are battered little signposts pointing towards that reality, and the gospels are written not to provide lively illustrations of those theories but to name and invoke the reality towards which they point. When Jesus wanted to explain to his followers what his death would mean he didn\u0026rsquo;t give them a theory, he gave them a meal on the one hand and a dramatic action on the other. The Word became flesh, and it is in flesh \u0026ndash; his flesh, and then, worryingly, our flesh \u0026ndash; that the truth is revealed. God forgive us that we have answered rationalistic scepticism with rationalistic fideism. The Word \u0026ndash; the Logos, the ultimate Reason in Person \u0026ndash; became flesh, and it is in the flesh that the world was saved; it is in the flesh that the glory was and is revealed.\nBecause, when we pan back from John 13 and see this tableau within the larger context of the fourth Gospel as a whole, we quickly discover that the whole book is about the revelation of the divine glory precisely in the salvation of the world, and that the way to understand these large abstractions is to see them within the vast and sprawling story of Israel and the world as set out in scripture. Richard Hays, the great contemporary American New Testament scholar, has once again put us in his debt with his new book, Echoes of Scripture in the Gospels; but even Hays would admit, I think, that there is far more still to be said about the ways in which the story of scripture resonates through all four gospels, particularly in their portrayal of the cross.\nIn particular, John positively urges us in his prologue to see the whole of the story he will tell within the long reach of the first two books of the Bible. John, after all, focuses his story again and again on the Temple, on Jesus' upstaging of the Temple, on his implicit warning to the Temple and its guardians, and on his final performance of that which the Temple itself could not effect. And what has that to do with Genesis and Exodus? Well, everything: because Genesis 1 and 2 describe, to anyone with first-century eyes, the construction of the ultimate Temple, the single heaven-and-earth reality, the one Cosmos within which the twin realities of God\u0026rsquo;s space and our space are held together in proper balance and mutual relation. The seven stages of creation are the seven stages of constructing a temple, into which the builder will come to take up residence, to take his \u0026lsquo;rest\u0026rsquo;: Here is Zion, my resting-place, says Israel\u0026rsquo;s God in the Psalms. And within this Temple there is of course, as the final element of construction, the Image: the true Image through which the rest of creation sees and worships the creator, the true Image through which the sovereign and loving creator becomes present to, in and with his creation, working out his purposes. Genesis 1 declares that the God who made the world is the heaven-and-earth God, the working-through-humans-in-the-world God. (I wish there was a word for that; it might be easier in German; or perhaps we could take the Greek and speak not just of an anthropic God, a God who was appropriately bodied forth in human life, but a dianthropic God, a God who desired to express himself perfectly by working through humans in the world.) And already, with this vision of Genesis before us, we understand both the beginning and the climax of John\u0026rsquo;s gospel: in the beginning, en arche, bereshith: in the beginning was the Word . . . and the Word became flesh. And on the last Friday, the ultimate sixth day of the week, the representative of the world\u0026rsquo;s ruler declares \u0026lsquo;behold the Man\u0026rsquo;: like Caiaphas earlier, Pontius Pilate says far, far more than he knows, acknowledging that Jesus is the Proper Man, the true Image, the one at whom, when people gaze, they see the Father; the one through whom the Father is present, and powerfully working, to bring about his desire and design. And in the end, when the light has shone in the gathering darkness and the darkness has tried to extinguish it, the final word echoes Genesis once more: tetelestai, it is finished. The work is accomplished. There follows the rest of the seventh day, the rest in the tomb, before the first day of the new week when Mary Magdalene comes to the garden and discovers that new creation has begun. John is writing a new Genesis, and the death of Jesus places at the heart of this new heaven-and-earth reality the sign and symbol of the Image through which the world will see and recognise its Creator and know him as the God of unstoppable love, the sign and symbol of the Image through which the Creator has established that love at the climax of world history and as the fountain-head for the rivers of living water that will now flow out to refresh and renew his whole world. That is the primary story John is telling.\nBut if it is a new Genesis it is also a new Exodus. For years, when reading Exodus, I confess that I used to misjudge what Moses says repeatedly to Pharaoh: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the desert. I used to think this was just an excuse: we want to go home to our promised land, but let\u0026rsquo;s just tell Pharaoh that we want to worship our God and that we can\u0026rsquo;t do it in his land, surrounded by his gods. But the whole logic of the book of Exodus, and indeed of the Pentateuch as a whole, forbids that interpretation. If you read Exodus at a run you will easily arrive at Mount Sinai in chapter 20; up to that point it\u0026rsquo;s a page-turner, one dramatic incident after another, but then suddenly the pace seems to slacken as we get miscellaneous rules and regulations, though not (to be honest) very many of them yet. Don\u0026rsquo;t stop there; forge ahead; because the whole narrative is indeed moving swiftly forward to the aim and object of the whole thing, which is the restoration of creation itself, the purpose for which God called Abraham and his family in the first place, the purpose through which heaven and earth will be joined together once more, only now in dramatic symbol and onward pointing sign. The giving of Torah itself is just a preparation; what matters is the Tabernacle. The Tabernacle is the microcosmos, the little world, the heaven-and-earth place, the mysterious, untameable, moving tent \u0026ndash; or perhaps it is the world that moves, while the tent stays still? \u0026ndash; in which the living God will come to dwell, to tabernacle, in the midst of his people, in the pillar of cloud by day and fire by night. The whole of the book of Exodus is itself moving towards this moment, in chapter 40, when the Tent is set up, constructed and decorated with the highest human artistry, which itself is part of the point, and the Divine Glory comes to dwell in it, so that even Moses couldn\u0026rsquo;t enter the Tent because of that glorious presence. Exodus 40 answers to Genesis 1 and 2: creation is renewed, heaven and earth are held together, the world itself is halted from its slide back towards chaos, and the people of God, tent-makers and tent-keepers and pilgrims wherever the glory-filled Tent will lead them, are to live the dangerous and challenging life of the people in whose midst there dwells, in strange humble sovereignty, the promise and hope for the whole of creation. (This is course is why Leviticus is where it is and what it is, with the priests as the humans who stand at the intersection of heaven and earth; but that\u0026rsquo;s another story.)\nAll of this and much more \u0026ndash; think of Solomon\u0026rsquo;s Temple in 1 Kings 8, think of the vision in Isaiah 6 \u0026ndash; is then poured by John into the dense and world-shaping reality of the Prologue as it reaches its climax. In the beginning was the Word; and the Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us; and we gazed upon his glory. We have been allowed where Moses was not. We have seen the glory, the heaven-and-earth reality, the human microcosmos, the Tent where the God of the Exodus is revealed as the One God of creation and new creation. The Exodus through which creation is rescued and renewed; the new creation which comes to birth on the eighth day after the dark power, the great and terrible Pharaoh, has been defeated once and for all. This is the story that John is telling.\nBecause of course it isn\u0026rsquo;t just Genesis and Exodus, and indeed Genesis and Exodus themselves indicate well enough that things are going to be anything but straightforward. Genesis 1 and 2 of course give way to the whispering serpent, the first murder, and the long decline into human arrogance which ends with the tower of Babel. Eden and Babylon, like Jesus and Judas at the Supper, frame the action which follows, as Abraham and his family are called to a stupendous vocation and come repeatedly within a whisker of throwing it all away; as the children of Israel, gloriously rescued and on their way to their promised inheritance, make a golden calf at the very moment when the true microcosmos was about to be constructed among them, so that Moses has to engage in frantic verbal fisticuffs with God to prevent him aborting the entire operation. (Don\u0026rsquo;t you love the way that conversation goes? God says to Moses, \u0026lsquo;Your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have rebelled, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to destroy them\u0026rsquo;; and Moses shoots right back with \u0026lsquo;Actually, they are your people, and you brought them out of Egypt, and it\u0026rsquo;s your reputation that\u0026rsquo;s on the line here.') But as the Pentateuch unwinds to its dark and puzzling conclusion it becomes clear that the people of God, the tent-keepers if you like, are still in themselves a rebellious people who will themselves have to suffer the fate of all those who put other Images at the intersection of heaven and earth. They will go into exile, not despite the fact that they are the covenant people but precisely because of that dangerous reality. God will fill his creation with his glory but it will come through the casting away and the receiving back of his tent-keepers.\nGenesis and Exodus, then, give us the structure, the framework. God will rescue and restore his heaven-and-earth creation, and the Tabernacle is the sign and seal of that promise, with Aaron and his sons as the image-reflectors to hold that hope together and Israel as a whole the royal priesthood for the whole of creation. Genesis to Deuteronomy give us the story, stretching forward in its final chapters to embrace the whole period of kings and prophets, of exile and restoration. The kings, themselves of course a deeply ambiguous lot, are nevertheless called to be image-bearers, to be the spearhead \u0026ndash; the metaphor is not too harsh \u0026ndash; of YHWH\u0026rsquo;s victory over the powers of evil, to be the focus of his reign of justice and peace. Or so it seemed, until kings and priests alike fail miserably. The prophets, particularly Isaiah and Ezekiel, see the glory of God and the shame of Israel in severe counterpoint, with the consequence that the shame is complete and the glory departs. But Ezekiel then describes the creation of the new Temple, with Ezekiel 43 corresponding to Exodus 40 as the divine glory returns at last. And Isaiah, in his gospel of comfort, describes the scene of majesty in which the sovereign God comes back with the mountains flattened and the valleys filled in for his glory to be revealed for all flesh to witness it; and the majesty is joined with gentle intimacy, exactly as in John 13, as he will feed his flock like a shepherd, gather the lambs in his arms, and gently lead the mother sheep. A new Exodus, in other words: the great prophetic theme which stretches like a long question-mark over the four hundred years after exile in Babel until a voice in the wilderness declares that the time has come. King, temple, new exodus, new creation; the themes come rushing together. Jesus chose Passover as the moment to do what had to be done, the moment he knew would awaken precisely those biblical resonances which would appropriately frame his final kingdom-bringing action and passion. The gospel writers, following this foundational insight, tell the story of Jesus as the story of the strange new Exodus in which the glory returns at last, in a form nobody had seen coming. No wonder Caiaphas and his cronies were alarmed. Their priestly role, standing between heaven and earth, was about to be upstaged once and for all and for ever by the true Image, the Word made flesh, who would sum up in himself the long-delayed obedience of Israel on the one hand and the long-awaited return of Israel\u0026rsquo;s God on the other. When St Paul, quoting the early Christian formula, says that the Messiah died for our sins \u0026lsquo;in accordance with the scriptures\u0026rsquo;, it is this complex narrative, full of doom and glory, which he has in mind. Proof-texts are for the birds (or, more accurately, for the neo-Marcionite rationalists); what matters is the story.\nBoth John and Paul draw out one theme in particular from Exodus, from Isaiah, from the entire earlier narrative. Babel must be overthrown if Abraham\u0026rsquo;s people are to inherit the world. Pharaoh must be overthrown if Abraham\u0026rsquo;s family are to be rescued. Babylon and its gods must be overthrown if the new Exodus is to be accomplished. All of this the prophets see, particularly again Isaiah for whom God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom will be established through the overthrow of the dark power and the redeeming return of YHWH to Zion. And all of this is retrieved by the gospel writers, and particularly John, as he leads the eye up from his prologue all the way through to the footwashing scene and on to the cross. Jesus\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;signs\u0026rsquo;, starting with the wedding at Cana (itself of course symbolizing the marriage of heaven and earth), reveal his glory; and the sequence of signs leads us, if we follow the clues John is leaving us, all the way to the cross itself where the dark glory of God is revealed as the glory of the true Image, the priest, the king, the lover. And this theme, picked up in the footwashing scene as we saw with Judas embodying the satan, is already highlighted as John draws together the first half of his gospel in chapter 12, where he quotes precisely those passages from Isaiah in which the themes I have been sketching come to sharp expression.\nThe crucial passage \u0026ndash; John 12.20-36 \u0026ndash; begins with a typical piece of Johannine puzzlement. Some Greeks come to the feast, and want to see Jesus. But instead of arranging a time later that day when they could sit down for a coffee together, Jesus proceeds to speak in riddles. This is the sign, he seems to be saying, that the hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified, for the grain of wheat to fall into the earth and die in order to bear much fruit. What on earth has that got to do with these poor Greeks who simply want to see him? Jesus looks beyond the immediate request to the ultimate purpose. The world upon which he looks out \u0026ndash; the pagan world, and also tragically the Jewish world \u0026ndash; is in the grip of the Pharaoh, the dark Babel-gods, \u0026lsquo;the ruler of this world\u0026rsquo;. There is no point simply having a chat with these Greeks here and now. What matters is not understanding the world, but rescuing it. This is the time for God\u0026rsquo;s name to be glorified, for judgment to be passed on the world: \u0026lsquo;Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world is to be cast out; and when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all people to myself\u0026rsquo;. Here we have it. Jesus' death will be the means by which \u0026ndash; in a moment of shocking and intense paradox, picked up by all the New Testament writers in their own ways \u0026ndash; the power that has gripped the world of Greek and Jew alike will be overthrown by the greater power, the power the world never imagined, the power of a love which loves its own and loves them to the end. In John\u0026rsquo;s gospel there are two things which cannot happen until Jesus has died \u0026ndash; apart, of course, from the resurrection itself and with it the launch of the new creation. First, in chapter 7, the Spirit cannot be poured out through and out of the hearts of the disciples until Jesus is \u0026lsquo;glorified\u0026rsquo;. Now here in chapter 12 the dark power which has held the whole world in its grip must be defeated before it makes any sense for the Greeks to come and see Jesus, to hold him perhaps within their world of theory when what matters is the world of the new temple, the new cosmos, the ultimate Image, the word made flesh. Jesus' death will be the overthrow of the Power, the \u0026lsquo;ruler of this world\u0026rsquo;. That is why the long scene in chapters 18 and 19, of Jesus in sharp dialogue with Pontius Pilate, the kingdom of God against the kingdom of Caesar, is so vital to the whole meaning of the story. Pilate asks about kingdom, and Jesus replies about truth; Pilate doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what truth is, because the only truth he knows is the power to kill. All power, says Jesus, comes from above. And what he doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain, because like the Greeks Pilate just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get it, is that the ultimate power is the footwashing power, the power of radical, transformative love. And on the cross, as John makes clear, that love goes to work, with the tender moment with Mary and John on the one hand and on the other Pilate himself, despite himself, declaring \u0026lsquo;what I have written I have written\u0026rsquo;, the ruler of this world declaring unwittingly that Jesus is indeed the King of the Jews, and hence, according to the Psalms and the prophets, the ultimate ruler and justice-bringer for the whole world. Tetelestai, it is finished: the new tabernacle, the new creation, rescued from the wreck of the old, through the king who is also the Passover lamb whose bones remain unbroken. New Exodus; real return from exile; return of YHWH to Zion; messianic enthronement; priestly work complete; creation ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven. My friends, please don\u0026rsquo;t ever think of trying to construct something called an \u0026lsquo;atonement-theology\u0026rsquo; unless you know, with John, what it means that the Messiah died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures.\nBecause of course we have tried \u0026ndash; the western tradition has tried \u0026ndash; to do it in many other ways. We have told many different stories, so that Israel\u0026rsquo;s scriptures become merely a source-book for random prophecies to be fitted into the redemption-narratives we have gleaned from other cultures. We have then distorted those texts themselves to play the role demanded by these other narratives: narratives of divine honour offended, of divine lawcourt sitting in judgment, of human muddle and mistake. All of these matter but if we start with them we will skew the whole. \u0026lsquo;Atonement\u0026rsquo; itself \u0026ndash; the word is far less precise than we normally imagine \u0026ndash; must include so much more, including the notions of sacrifice, which itself demands that we stop not at the cross but with the Ascension where, according to Hebrews, the Son offers his once-for-all sacrifice in the heavenly temple. And all these ideas can themselves be distorted, and have themselves been distorted, as we have put them into our different frameworks. In particular, we have radically misread the entire sacrificial tradition of ancient Israel, in which animals were not subjected to a vicarious death penalty but were killed so that their blood, itself a gift from God, would cleanse the sanctuary to maintain the heaven-and-earth reality in the midst of an as yet unredeemed world. Passover itself was not an atoning sacrifice. The only animal that has sins confessed over its head is the only animal in the Levitical rituals that does not get killed: the scapegoat is driven away, bearing Israel\u0026rsquo;s sins into the wilderness. And, as I try to explain in the book, the much-cherished and heavily guarded statements of atonement theology that we all learned from the sixteenth-century reformers, though vital as a bulwark against error, were themselves framed far more in terms of the late mediaeval ideas, particularly of purgatory and the mass, to which the reformers were reacting. The reformers were doing the noble job of trying to give biblical answers to fifteenth-century questions. Fine: but the Bible itself upon which they rightly insisted itself makes it clear that this is not enough. We must get inside the world of the Bible, must understand what it means that the Messiah died for our sins in accordance with, along the line of, as the fulfilment of, the great single narrative of Israel\u0026rsquo;s scriptures. Only so will we get fresh clarity in our thinking and, equally importantly, fresh energy for our mission.\nBecause, as again I try to explain in the book, we have I believe committed a triple mistake in our thinking about the cross \u0026ndash; though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t start with the cross, but, like so many things, with our eschatology. We have platonized our eschatology, speaking and praying about \u0026lsquo;going to heaven when we die\u0026rsquo; without realising that this is the first-century teaching, not of the New Testament, but of Plutarch and the other middle Platonists. The New Testament is not about souls going up to heaven but about the new Jerusalem coming down from heaven to earth, about the new creation already symbolized in the wilderness tabernacle and brought into reality by the Royal Priest, Israel\u0026rsquo;s ultimate representative, the Word made Flesh. And this isn\u0026rsquo;t just a matter of adjusting some nuts and bolts of what we say and think about our ultimate future \u0026ndash; about God\u0026rsquo;s ultimate future! What we say about the future plays back at once into how we conceive the problem to which the cross and resurrection are the God-given solution. If we are simply thinking about our souls going to heaven we quickly shrink the human vocation \u0026ndash; to be the Image-bearers, the Royal Priesthood \u0026ndash; into mere morality. Morality matters vitally but it matters because it is the byproduct of being Image-bearers, summing up the praises of creation rather than worshipping and serving the creature; morality matters because only through true image-bearers will the rescuing divine justice flow out into the world. But if we focus on morality \u0026ndash; making the knowledge of good and evil the fruit around which we construct our theological menu \u0026ndash; then we turn the whole large drama of creation and new creation into a self-centred play about me and my sin and what God\u0026rsquo;s going to do about it. And, with a great deal of western theology, we then re-read Genesis and all that follows not as the story of the Temple and the Image but as the story of humans failing an exam, deserving punishment, and the punishment eventually falling elsewhere. And though there is indeed truth within that shrunken narrative \u0026ndash; the truth of the Cross is so vast and deep that it shines out still even from our distortions \u0026ndash; if we put that little moral equation at the centre we will never understand what the Bible as a whole, what Jesus as a whole, was and is all about. We have, then, platonized our eschatology, and to fit we have moralized our anthropology.\nAnd the result is that we have again and again been in danger of paganizing our soteriology. It is in the ancient pagan world, not the ancient Jewish world, that we find stories of an angry God and an innocent victim and a king or an expedition or a country being rescued from divine wrath because someone \u0026ndash; preferably an innocent someone \u0026ndash; get in the way at the last minute. Now I know that few if any preachers, and few if any theologians, will own up to having preached about Jesus in that way. They will always insist that they speak of Jesus' death as the act of divine love. But you know, and I know, that this pagan story is what generations of people in the churches have heard. And it\u0026rsquo;s all too easy for them to hear it because that is often how generations of Christians have behaved: using would-be redemptive violence whether domestically or internationally, and always asserting that it is done out of love, done with the best of intentions. And so people hear what they think is the gospel, and instead of hearing \u0026lsquo;God so loved the world that he gave his only son\u0026rsquo; they hear \u0026lsquo;God so hated the world that he killed his only son\u0026rsquo;. And because that pagan story is so easy for people to slip into in their imaginations, generations have done exactly that; and the biblical truth of penal substitution is thereby both distorted and shrunk.\nDistorted: because there *is *a biblical truth we can call penal substitution, but it is not well expressed within the platonized eschatology and the moralized anthropology. It belongs in its clearest formulaic expression in Romans 8.1-4, where Paul declares that there is \u0026lsquo;no condemnation for those in the Messiah\u0026rsquo;, because on the cross \u0026lsquo;God condemned Sin in the flesh\u0026rsquo;. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t say that God punished Jesus; he says God punished Sin \u0026ndash; Sin with a capital S, as we might say \u0026ndash; in the representative flesh of the Messiah. That is at the heart of a complicated argument which I have tried to spell out in the book and won\u0026rsquo;t attempt even to summarize here, except to say that the clearest *non­-*formulaic expressions are found where most theologians don\u0026rsquo;t bother looking for them \u0026ndash; in the four gospels themselves. (And, by the way, this is one reason among many others why there is such a fad, both in the Dan Brown circles and in western theology, particularly in America, for the non-canonical gospels like Thomas and the rest. This deep and dark narrative has been surgically removed from those traditions, because the true gospel is far more shocking and radical than the gnostics ancient and modern have ever understood or wanted to understand.) The four gospels are all about the Kingdom of God, a theme astonishingly muted to this day in much modern western preaching and teaching, even among would-be Bible Christians, perhaps for the reason that it generates at once, as John\u0026rsquo;s gospel does in spades, what we today with our little categories call \u0026lsquo;political theology\u0026rsquo;. How can the good news that the world\u0026rsquo;s creator has rescued creation from disaster and established his Son, his true Image, at the centre of his remade world \u0026ndash; how can this news not at once have implications for every polis, every household, every community and country, every polity and policy? How can we not at once be driven to reflect and act on the basis that the dark powers have been defeated so that the power of love may flood the world and bring about the justice and peace which the secular world knows it wants but can\u0026rsquo;t seem to find?\nThis is what I mean when I say that the normal theories about the atonement have not only distorted but also \u0026lsquo;shrunk\u0026rsquo; the meaning of penal substitution. In the four gospels the story of Jesus is set in counterpoint with the story of evil: of the snake in the garden, the tottering tower of Babel, the power of Pharaoh killing the babies (think of Herod in the gospels), of rebellious Israel, wicked priests and kings, false prophets, idolatries to left, right and centre. Jesus goes on his way, announcing that this is how God is becoming king, and apparently drawing onto himself as though by a magnet all the evil in the world, from the shrieking demons in the synagogue to the plotting priests in the Sanhedrin and ultimately to the pathetic representative of the Ruler of the World. Judas and Pilate merely bring into sharp focus what is going on all along. And Evil \u0026ndash; Sin with a capital S \u0026ndash; is gathered together into one place and does its worst, the worst thing imaginable, killing the one true Man, the one genuine Israelite, the Word made flesh. And with his death, exactly as Isaiah, Zechariah and the Psalms had glimpsed through a glass darkly, Pharaoh is overthrown, Babel tumbles to the ground, the gods of the world had done their worst. As Paul put it in Colossians, on the cross Jesus disarmed the principalities and powers and made a public example of them, celebrating his triumph over them. And the way this happened was by Jesus, representing Israel, representing thereby the whole human race, and equally representing and embodying the one God himself \u0026ndash; by Jesus taking upon himself the weight of evil hanging over all flesh. One person must die, said unwitting Caiaphas, so that the nation may not perish; yes, says John, and not just the nation but the whole scattered children of God. \u0026lsquo;This is your hour,\u0026rsquo; said Jesus as they arrested him, \u0026lsquo;and the power of darkness\u0026rsquo;; and he went into the heart of that darkness so that Peter and the others would not suffer it; so that Barabbas and the brigand on the cross might be freed; so that, like the chickens protected by the death of the mother hen, all those who came to him for refuge would find that he had taken their place. The victory is won \u0026ndash; \u0026lsquo;Christus Victor\u0026rsquo;, if you like, but a much bigger idea than many theories which have gone by that name \u0026ndash; through the representative substitution of the Servant, the Son, the Image, the Lover, the footwasher, the one who has saved the world and revealed the glory at last.\nAnd that, not some cheap and logic-chopped scheme, is why there is forgiveness of sins; that is why there is now a Gentile mission; that is why the followers of Jesus do not constitute \u0026lsquo;a religion\u0026rsquo; like other so-called \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;, to be catalogued by secular modernity, pinned to the wall like so many dead butterflies, but a polis, a new kind of city, a new kind of community, a Spirit-driven, suffering-love people who follow their Master to the places where the world is in sharpest pain in order that by the Spirit they may embody the love of God and the pain of God right there, and so bring the healing of God and the hope of God into the world that so badly needs it. Unless we read the gospels like this we are falsifying them, as we do when we chop them into tiny snippets and turn them into moral lessons, or even, heaven help us, into abstract theological lessons. They are the living story of how the Lord of life drew the powers of evil on to himself and, by dying under their weight, disarmed and disabled them so that from now on they are a defeated rabble, even though in our dualistic modern spiritualities we still imagine them to have power over us. They are the launching-narrative of our own story, the first act in the new divine drama in which we are called to play our parts.\nAnd this is why, as I draw to my close and thank you for your kind attention through a rather brief and partial treatment, we need not a refined set of theories but a larger vision of the biblical narrative if we are to understand, preach and live out the message and meaning of the cross. The heart of my new book asks a question: by the evening of the first Good Friday, what had changed in the world? Clearly all the New Testament writers think that something has changed: what was it and how do we make that new reality our own? The modern world has displaced the Christian narrative; it isn\u0026rsquo;t just that most of our contemporaries profess not to believe in God or Jesus, but that they have in their heads a world narrative in which world history arrived at its redemptive moment in the eighteenth century with the rise of science and technology and the banishing of God to a distant realm, to be visited by the pious few like a kind family calling on an elderly relative every Sunday. The western churches have regularly colluded with this absurd diminishment of the Bible and the gospel. But the cross, told as the climax of all four gospels and particularly John\u0026rsquo;s on which I have focused this evening, leaves us no choice. \u0026lsquo;Now is the judgment of this world; now is the ruler of the world cast out; and if I am lifted up from the earth I will draw all people to myself.\u0026rsquo; This is what it means that the Messiah died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures. We have some fresh thinking to do, to put it mildly. But thinking, the realm of logos, has become flesh, and must once again become flesh, our flesh, our footwashing flesh, driven by the Spirit to be for the world what Jesus was for Israel, to be the means by which the Spirit holds the world to account as Jesus held Pilate to account. Having loved his own, having revealed the glory, Jesus loved them to the end; and as he resumed his clothes he told them, \u0026lsquo;This is my command: that you love one another as I have loved you.\u0026rsquo; That is how the glory will be revealed in tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s world. That is how the world, saved once for all by his victory on the cross, will as he promised be flooded with his glory and knowledge as the waters cover the sea. We are to be, in the power of the Spirit, new Genesis people; new Exodus people; new Isaiah people; new gospel people; new Jesus people. That is the meaning of atonement, then and now.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8d21a70c28be839c4a4599881c156e85","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/nt-wright/saving-the-world-revealing-the-glory_atonement-then-and-now/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/nt-wright/saving-the-world-revealing-the-glory_atonement-then-and-now/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Saving the World, Revealing the Glory: Atonement Then and Now\nSaving the World, Revealing the Glory: Atonement Then and Now\nRt.

It is by faith according to the Gospel of Christ.\nRom 3:20-22 because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin. But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,\nRom 4:3 Abraham is an example from scripture\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\u0026rdquo;\nRom 4:5 \u0026ndash; the same way for us all. \u0026ldquo;But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,\u0026rdquo;\nRom 4:9 it is faith in gods promises, not faith in Jesus' sacrifice. But the Gospel requires that this faith includes faith that Jesus is God incarnate. Faith that Israel is God\u0026rsquo;s chosen people is not enough (Rom 9:31). Our faith must include not labouring for our own righteousness and therefore must include faith that God gives us righteousness as a gift.\n\u0026ldquo;For not knowing about God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 4For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 10:3-4)\nRom 5:1 \u0026ldquo;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,\u0026rdquo;\nRom 9:30 What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith;\n\u0026quot;Righteousness by faith\u0026quot; is a transaction, an experience. It is submitting to \u0026quot;the righteousness of God.\u0026quot; It is a change of standing before God and His law. It is a regeneration, a new birth. Because of this it is not simply a cover for unrepentant sin, allowing us to live as we wish.\nRom 6, \u0026ldquo;Offer yourself to God\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Yielding to Christ\u0026rsquo;s righteousness is required for us to be sanctified. It is His work in us which we can give ourselves to or resist. But we have to do the giving. It is offering, sacrificing, giving ourselves over to His transformation, rather than a grudging allowing Him to correct us in small measure.\nWe are sanctified by the truth. As we meditate on God\u0026rsquo;s purity and righteousness we are drawn into Him and see righteousness as more and more attractive.\nChrist is both the author and finisher of our faith; He justifies and sanctifies us.\nGod made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. 2 Cor 5:21\nOthers 1 Cor 1:30, 31 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God\u0026mdash;that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. Therefore, as it is written: \u0026ldquo;Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You must be righteous even as your father in heaven is righteous.\nMy thoughts Hebrews 10:22 let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. Hebrews 9:9 This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. 1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 1 John 2:28 And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming. Galatians 2:16 know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. Galatians 3:9 So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. Galatians 3:27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. Hebrews 9:28 so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him. - there is nothing more that needs to be done for our son. Jesus has already done it all. Do you feel Teflon-coated clean? All-the-time clean? That your sin and shortcomings do not and cannot make you dirty or give you a guilty conscience? That you do not need to confess your sins to God in order to draw near to him with joy and confidence. Hebrews 10:14 For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy. Hebrews 10:17-18 Then he adds: \u0026quot;Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.\u0026quot; And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary. It is not just about Jesus obtaining forgiveness for our sins. Wonderful as that is, it is not all that his death has achieved for us. We can know we are forgiven, but still be very conscious of our sinfulness. Our conscience can condemn us even though we know God does not. We need to know our sins are forgiven as a free gift, with nothing at all for us to contribute. But in order for us to have a clean conscience we also need to know that Christ is our righteousness. Our identity is Christ, not mucky me. My conscience is his conscience, my confidence is his confidence, my righteousness is his righteousness. And this not as a doctrinal truth but as a felt reality. If our conscience condemns us when we have learnt to live in Christ, then we know something is seriously wrong! We must not suppress that warning, but pay attention to the discipline of the Lord. \u0026quot;if our conscience does not condemn us...\u0026quot; Yet this treasure is hidden in jars of clay. That is how God wants it to be. 2 Corinthians 4:7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. I used to feel that my every action and thought was scrutinised by God and found wanting. Although I knew I was forgiven and accepted in Christ, it still left me feeling I was basically displeasing to God, always falling short. This made fellowship with him a bit like a visit to the dentist, necessary but not a pleasant prospect. Instead my basic inclination was to avoid him except for allotted quiet times.  Sharing in Intercession The mystery of prayer\nThe scriptures never really explain prayer. Why do we need to pray to a loving God who knows the thoughts of our hearts, knows our needs better than we do, who clothes the lilies and feeds the sparrows without them asking? Jesus told us to pray but never explained why it is necessary.\nHowever the scriptures tell us some intriguing truths about prayer. We are given some familiar examples of intercessory prayer in characters such as Abraham, Moses, Samuel and Elijah. Isaiah tells us that God was searching through the land looking for someone to intercede for Israel, but found no one. Jesus interceded for Peter (Lk 22:31), and for all of us (Jn 17).\nSee zech 12:10\nIn each of these cases it is clear that God himself was provoking and motivating the intercession. This tells us something very important about intercession. It is not men trying to move the hand of God, but God trying to engage men in His mission. However strange this may seem to us, it is essential to understand that all effective prayer originates in God's heart, not ours. That is why John says, if we know we pray according to his will we know we have received whatever we ask (1Jn 5:14-15).\nThe new testament tells us two extraordinary facts in relation to prayer, the significance of which I think has largely gone unnoticed. The first is that the Holy Spirit intercedes for us (Rom 8:26), the second is that Jesus intercedes for it us (Heb 7:25)\nRomans 8:26 In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.\nRomans 8:27 Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit [is,] because He makes intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God.\nHebrews 7:25 Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. Romans8:34 Who [is] he who condemns? [It is] Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.\nThe fact that both the Holy Spirit and Jesus are engaged in intercession tells us that intercession has nothing to do with moving God on behalf of men, but rather it is to share in a divine mystery. As Paul says in Rome 8:27 the Spirit intercedes according to the will of God. It is God's will that we intercede before Him.\nJesus and the Holy Spirit make intercession and the Father receives it. Virtually all biblical prayers are addressed to the Father. Although Jesus does give us authority to pray to him promising that he will answer John14:13-14 And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do [it.]\nBy the Holy Spirit working and living within us, we are \u0026lsquo;caught up\u0026rsquo; into what we might call the divine dialogue of the Trinity.\nIntercession is part of the inner working of God Himself. Why this should be and how it works we will perhaps never know, but to know this fact transforms our understanding of prayer and intercession. Intercession is no longer seen as man pleading with God, but rather men sharing in God's very nature. Seen like this prayer becomes full of faith and joy. It becomes an adventure exploring the very heart of God and sharing in His passions and purposes for the world. To truly pray is to be caught up with the Holy Spirit into God's throne room; not to plead with God but to rule with him.\nAll we have to do is to choose to take time to pray and to put ourselves, as it were, \u0026lsquo;at God\u0026rsquo;s disposal\u0026rsquo;, allowing the Spirit to do the work within us.\nPrayer and especially intercession is sharing in the divine nature and as such is an expression and experience of deep intimacy with God.\nSeen like this, prayer starts with us coming to God and saying, \u0026quot;I know you are interceding for XYZ, can I join in too?\u0026quot; Wow! That sounds like a recipe for answered prayer.\nApproached like this we are far less likely to start telling God what to do and more inclined to start with, \u0026quot;Lord, please show me what is on your heart for this situation.\u0026quot; This means we need to take time to listen to God.\nA part of the mystery of prayer is that intercession takes time. God does not tell us why, He just tells us that it does:\nLuke 18:7-8 And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\u0026quot;\nGod promises to answer quickly the prayers of those who cry out day and night. The intercession of Jesus and the Holy Spirit are ongoing and persistent. As we share in that intercession we also need to share in persistence until we know we have our answer or we actually see the answer. This also is a matter hearing God.\nAnother part of the mystery of intercession is that God looks for human partners to join Jesus and the Holy Spirit in intercession. What a privilege to be able to partner with God in this way.\n(Romans 8:27) It is about the transforming and healing nature of love, for intercession is about the expression of our love and our willingness to share in the transformation and healing of the world that is the will of God. And it is about patience and perseverance.\nRom 8 assumes that generally we do know what to pray. God puts on our hearts those things he wants us to join with him in intercession for. His sheep hear his voice.\n Solitary\nLengthy\nTiring\nNot necessarily with understanding\nNot sophisticated.

Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.\u0026quot; (Matt 6:5-7)\nFast Without Fanfare \u0026quot;When you fast, do not look sombre as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting.

We may not be able to imagine preaching the Gospel without reference to the cross, yet the Gospel Jesus proclaimed did not include, as far as we can tell, references to Him paying the penalty for our sins on the cross!\nWe might think that Jesus could not speak of the His atoning death because it had not yet happened, yet we find that Jesus made numerous references to His coming death and resurrection:\n \u0026ldquo;Surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem! O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing! Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, \u0026lsquo;Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'\u0026rdquo; (Lk 13:33-35)\nJesus took the Twelve aside and told them, \u0026lsquo;We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. He will be handed over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him and spit on him; they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.\u0026rsquo; (Lk 18:31-33)\n\u0026ldquo;For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 12:40)\nAs they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead ... But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognise him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 17:9-12)\n According to the Gospel record, the only time Jesus explained His coming death as an atonement was during the Last Supper:\n \u0026ldquo;This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 26:28)\n This one occurrence proves that Jesus understood His coming death as atonement, yet before the Last Supper He chose not to explain this when He spoke of His death.\nAlthough Jesus referred to His death in various ways He never took the opportunity to explain its role in paying for our sin. He either simply spoke about the event or used it to teach that suffering and persecution was to be expected as the cost of following Him:\n \u0026ldquo;The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. (Lk 9:22-23)\n\u0026ldquo;Then the owner of the vineyard said, \u0026lsquo;What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.\u0026rsquo; But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. \u0026lsquo;This is the heir,\u0026rsquo; they said. \u0026lsquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'... He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 20:13-16)\n We are so used to explaining the Gospel in terms of the cross as an atonement that we may fail to stop and consider the Gospel that Jesus Himself preached. The purpose of this study is to explore Jesus\u0026rsquo; Gospel and consider how His example might influence the way we share the Gospel.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; Gospel The Gospel is announced by Jesus very simply, as recorded in Mark 1:15:\n \u0026ldquo;The time has come,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!\u0026rdquo;\n To understand the Gospels and the person and mission of Jesus we need to understand what this simple statement meant to Jesus and his hearers. There are three parts we need to understand:\n  The time has come\n  The kingdom of God is near\n  Repent and believe the good news\n  The time has come John\u0026rsquo;s preaching made people expectant:\n The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ. (Lk 3:15)\n Jesus' announcement \u0026ldquo;The time has come\u0026rdquo; builds on this expectation which was based on many prophecies, spanning the entire period of the Old Testament, concerning a coming new Kingdom of God. Here is a small selection:\n \u0026ldquo;The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers. You must listen to him.\u0026rdquo; (De 18:15 NIV)\nIn the last days the mountain of the LORD\u0026rsquo;s temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it. Many peoples will come and say, \u0026ldquo;Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.\u0026rdquo; (Isa 2:2-3)\nFor to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David\u0026rsquo;s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and for ever. (Isa 9:6-7)\nRejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the war-horses from Jerusalem, and the battle-bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth. (Zech 9:9-10)\n Prophecies like these gave the Israelites an unquenchable expectation that one day God would visit His chosen people and restore their fortunes under a Godly king in David\u0026rsquo;s line.\nThe kingdom of God is near The prophecies did not just point to a new king, but to a whole new covenant with God in a new Kingdom under God\u0026rsquo;s rule:\n \u0026ldquo;The time is coming,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after that time,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will a man teach his neighbour, or a man his brother, saying, \u0026lsquo;Know the LORD,\u0026rsquo; because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.\u0026rdquo; (Jer 31:31-34)\n\u0026ldquo;My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. They will follow my laws and be careful to keep my decrees. They and their children and their children\u0026rsquo;s children will live in the Promised Land for ever, and David my servant will be their prince for ever. I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. ... My dwelling-place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people. Then the nations will know that I the LORD make Israel holy\u0026rdquo; (Ezek 37:24-28)\n\u0026ldquo;The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the LORD\u0026rsquo;s favour and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion\u0026mdash;to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the display of his splendour ... You will feed on the wealth of nations, and in their riches you will boast. (Isa 61:1-6)\n Repent and believe the good news All these prophecies were given to a disobedient people of God who needed to repent of their waywardness and respond in obedience to the prophet\u0026rsquo;s message. The expectation produced by the wealth of prophecies was that God would send a Messiah who would turn the hearts of the people back to God in heartfelt repentance.\n \u0026ldquo;If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.\u0026rdquo; (2Ch 7:14)\nAfterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the LORD their God, and David their king, and they shall come in fear to the LORD and to his goodness in the latter days. (Hosea 3:5)\n The astonishing thing was that not only did Jesus call for repentance he also announced forgiveness -something only a priest could do, and that only in the temple in God\u0026rsquo;s presence. Jesus made Himself that presence by declaring forgiveness. It is important for us to note that although Jesus did not explain the atonement, He did announce forgiveness.\nAnticipating the Kingdom Jesus' announcement of the Kingdom had been anticipated by numerous notable events recorded by Matthew and Luke:\n The angelic visit to Zachariah:   \u0026ldquo;Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John ... Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God. And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous\u0026mdash;to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 1:16-17)\n  The angelic visit to Mary:   \u0026ldquo;You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; his kingdom will never end.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 1:31-32)\n  Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy at Johns birth:   \u0026ldquo;Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come and has redeemed his people. He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago), salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us\u0026mdash; to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant, the oath he swore to our father Abraham: to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 1:67-75 NIV)\n  The angelic visit to the shepherds:   \u0026ldquo;Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 2:10-11)\n  Simeon\u0026rsquo;s prophecy about Jesus:   \u0026ldquo;Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 2:29-32)\n  The testimony of the Magi:   \u0026ldquo;Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 2:2)\n  John the Baptist\u0026rsquo;s preaching:   In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Desert of Judea and saying, \u0026ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 3:1)\n\u0026ldquo;John said to the crowds coming out to be baptised by him, \u0026ldquo;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, \u0026lsquo;We have Abraham as our father.\u0026rsquo; For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. The axe is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What should we do then?\u0026rdquo; the crowd asked. (Lk 3:7-10)\nThe people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ. (Lk 3:15)\n\u0026ldquo;I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 1:34)\n Announcing the Good News Jesus started his ministry by preaching in the synagogues:\n Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He taught in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. (Lk 4:14-15)\n Luke provides us with an example of this early ministry, where Jesus reads a prophecy of the coming Kingdom and announces that this prophecy is now fulfilled:\n On the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom, and he stood up to read. The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: \u0026ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour.\u0026rdquo; Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him, and he began by saying to them, \u0026ldquo;Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 4:16-21 NIV)\n The new age Jesus preached consisted of victory over Satan as demonstrated by healing and deliverance, and a new relationship with God as demonstrated through the pronouncement of forgiveness and Jesus' teaching on prayer. Everywhere Jesus preached He also demonstrated the presence of the New Kingdom.\nIn fact Jesus summarised His mission very simply:\n \u0026ldquo;I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 13:32)\n When we pray the Lord\u0026rsquo;s prayer, saying \u0026ldquo;Your Kingdom come and your will be done on earth as it is in heaven\u0026rdquo; this is what we are praying for; the present reality of the Kingdom that Jesus preached and demonstrated in healing and deliverance. Without that we can hardly claim to have the Gospel, and without demonstrating it we can hardly claim to be proclaiming the Gospel. Jesus' Gospel was not primarily about going to heaven when we die, but about bringing Heaven\u0026rsquo;s rule here and now on earth. The miracles were not to prove who Jesus was but the simple outworking of His Gospel announcement, \u0026ldquo;The Kingdom of God has come\u0026rdquo;:\n \u0026ldquo;But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 11:20)\n Jesus' ascension was the climax for the disciples seeing the kingdom coming; Jesus' enthronement to rule the Kingdom He had begun to demonstrate; Jesus now in the heavenly realm from where He would continue to rule on earth, both directly and also through all those who believed in Him.\nThe Gospel that Jesus preached was the Kingdom of God here and now.\nJesus Himself is the Good News Jesus very clearly presented Himself as the Good News:\nHe is the \u0026ldquo;prophet like Moses\u0026rdquo;  The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers. You must listen to him. (De 18:15)\nHe will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.\u0026rdquo; (Isa 2: 3)\n In accordance with the ancient prophecy Jesus placed Himself above Moses in authority. Six times in Matt 5:21-48 Jesus quoted from Moses and replaced the Law with His own instruction. \u0026ldquo;Moses said ... but I say ...\u0026rdquo;\nJesus made claims to knowing the Father beyond anything Moses could claim:\n Then Moses said, \u0026ldquo;Now show me your glory.\u0026rdquo; And the LORD said, \u0026ldquo;I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence... But you cannot see my face, for no-one may see me and live.\u0026rdquo; (Ex 33:18-20)\nSince then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face. (De 34:10)\n Jesus is this prophet who has known the Lord face to face; able to speak from having seen God\u0026rsquo;s face, not just His back.\n \u0026ldquo;No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 1:18)\n\u0026ldquo;the Father knows me and I know the Father\u0026rdquo; (Jn 10:15)\n\u0026ldquo;I and the Father are one.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 10:30)\n\u0026ldquo;I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 16:28)\n\u0026ldquo;No-one knows the Son except the Father, and no-one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 11:27)\n He is the anointed one  \u0026ldquo;I have come from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 6:38)\n\u0026ldquo;I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 8:42)\n\u0026ldquo;No-one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 6:44)\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 10:10)\n He is the Prince of Peace  \u0026ldquo;Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 5:34)\n\u0026ldquo;Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 14:27)\n\u0026ldquo;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 11:28-30)\n He is the Eternal King  \u0026ldquo;All things have been committed to me by my Father.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 11:27)\n\u0026ldquo;The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 3:35)\n\u0026ldquo;The Father judges no-one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son\u0026rdquo; (Jn 5:22)\n\u0026ldquo;You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 18:37)\n\u0026ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 25:31-32)\n Jesus is how we know God  No longer will they teach their neighbour, or say to one another, \u0026lsquo;Know the LORD,\u0026rsquo; because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.\u0026rdquo; (Jer 31:34)\n Jesus presented Himself as the way we can know God.\n \u0026ldquo;I am the way and the truth and the life. No-one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 14:6-7)\n\u0026ldquo;Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 14:9)\n\u0026ldquo;All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 16:15)\n Jesus is the victor over our enemy The very first act of Jesus' mission was to confront Satan in the wilderness. All the synoptic gospels record the Holy Spirit leading Jesus to face the temptations:\n Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. (Lk 4:1-2)\n His mission was to invaded Satan\u0026rsquo;s territory and set people free. First He needed to overcome Satan and bind him:\n \u0026ldquo;But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. How can anyone enter a strong man\u0026rsquo;s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 12:28-29)\n He did this by His obedience.\n Jesus said to him, \u0026ldquo;Away from me, Satan! For it is written: \u0026lsquo;Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'\u0026rdquo; Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him. (Matt 4:10-11)\n Jesus\u0026rsquo; obedience to His Father gave Him full authority and power over Satan and his demons:\n \u0026ldquo;I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 10:18-19)\n\u0026ldquo;Should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?\u0026rdquo; (Lk 13:16)\n\u0026ldquo;Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 12:31)\n Jesus can forgive us our sins  \u0026ldquo;But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; He said to the paralysed man, \u0026ldquo;I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 5:24)\n\u0026ldquo;For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 5:21)\n A Summary of the Gospel Our brief exploration of the Gospel Jesus preached has taken us five pages! If we are to be able to share the gospel Jesus preached without referring to a book we need to summarise it in a few words. When we look for such a summary in the Gospels we find that Jesus provided many different summaries, each tailored for a different need (look for example at Matthew 13). We need to learn from Jesus and offer short relevant summaries according to the need of the person we are talking to.\nThe New Testament nearly always describes the Gospel as the \u0026ldquo;Gospel of the Kingdom\u0026rdquo;. Any Gospel summary we present should also be about the Kingdom of God, and not just about individual forgiveness.\nThere are at least 17 descriptions of the Gospel in the Acts. Here is the complete list with the sermons in bold:\nActs 2:10; Acts 2:17, 21, 23, 36, 38; Acts 4:29-31; Acts 5:41; Acts 7; Acts 8:5-7, 12; Acts 10:36-38, 42-43; Acts 13:32, 38-39; Acts 14:3; Acts 14:15, 22; Acts 16:30-31; Acts 17:7, 16, 18, 30-31; Acts 18:5; Acts 19:8; Acts 20:21; Acts 26:17-18; Acts 28:8-9; Acts 28:23, 31.\nOf these, at least 11 emphasise Jesus as Messiah or King. Only three descriptions of the Gospel include forgiveness of sins! The others emphasise turning to God in faith.\nHere are some of the most illuminating examples:\nHe commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. (Acts 10:42-43)\n \u0026quot;They are all defying Caesar\u0026rsquo;s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.\u0026quot;... Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. ... \u0026quot;He commands all people everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.\u0026quot; (Acts 17:7, 16, 18, 30-31)\nActs 13:32, 38-39 \u0026ldquo;We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus ... I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses.\u0026quot;\n Acts 14:15 We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them\u0026quot;\n Acts 26:17-18 \u0026quot;I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.\u0026quot;\n Acts 10:42-43 and Acts 26:17-18 are especially illuminating as they both tell us directly what Jesus told the disciples to preach.\nOn the six occasions where we get more detail the gospel is presented as a story of God acting in His world to reveal Himself to mankind. In each case Jesus' resurrection is the climax of the story. Jesus is the King of God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom and the rightful judge of all mankind. His desire and invitation is for us to believe and come into His Kingdom.\nFor our gospel preaching to be authentic, it must focus on the Kingdom of God and not on personal sin.\nPresenting The Gospel as Jesus did The Gospel is Good News The point we must remember is that the Gospel is, by definition, Good News! (At least it is to those who respond in trusting obedience to Jesus.) Good news, again by definition, is something that makes people cheerful and gives them hope. That in turn means it must connect with a need or concern that makes sense to the person. That is why Jesus tailored His message to the needs and concerns of the person he was addressing. We should do the same.\nThe \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; four-part gospel message goes something like:\n  God created you for relationship with Him.\n  You are alienated from God because of your sin and destined for eternal hell.\n  Jesus died to pay the penalty for your sin.\n  Only by faith and obedience to Jesus can we be restored to friendship with God.\n  Can this be described as the Gospel of the Kingdom? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. It is focused on an individual\u0026rsquo;s sinful acts rather than dealing with the Kingdom of which they are part. The Kingdom and Jesus' resurrection are not key features and may not be mentioned at all.\nAnother problem with this way of presenting the Gospel is that most people don\u0026rsquo;t readily relate to it as good news; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t scratch where they itch. You therefore have to first work hard at getting a person to \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; that they have a problem in their relationship with God that really matters. Only then does this gospel sound like good news. You might be able to get them to pray a prayer asking for forgiveness but probably by the next day they will have forgotten all about it. The simple fact is that more than 90% of people who \u0026ldquo;respond\u0026rdquo; to this version of the gospel do not go on to become disciples of Jesus.\nAnd yet in three short years, without first explaining the atonement, Jesus raised up more than 500 disciples to whom he appeared after His resurrection (1Cor 15:6). It seems likely that on the road to Emmaus after the resurrection Jesus gave a full explanation of His death as atonement:\n \u0026ldquo;Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?\u0026quot;^ ^And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. (Lk 24:26-27)\n Here, I think we have a significant point. An explanation of the Gospel in terms of our sin separating us from God is probably not generally the best approach. That can come later when a person has already met Jesus and they are curious to understand the scriptures. Let us learn from Jesus.\nJesus did not have any difficulty drawing a crowd because He spoke about things that mattered to His hearers. But more than that, He healed and delivered them and even fed them! But there is one thing Jesus never did...\nNo Appeal There is not a single record of Jesus following His teaching with an appeal for people to become disciples. No one is invited to pray a sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer. In fact when we examine Jesus' approach to \u0026ldquo;soul-winning\u0026rdquo; it is rather shocking.\nTake for example His preaching in Nazareth which Luke tells us about in some detail. Jesus had already gained a reputation in Capernaum and the people gathered in the synagogue are eager to hear Him for themselves:\n Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He taught in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom ... All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t this Joseph\u0026rsquo;s son?\u0026rdquo; they asked. (Lk 4:14-22)\n Jesus is full of the power of the Spirit; He has their rapt attention; they are hanging on His every word. All Jesus needs to do is to urge them to turn their hearts to God, confess their sin and ask for forgiveness. Jesus Himself can forgive them there and then. What a harvest to celebrate at the start of His ministry!\nBut no. With no provocation from the congregation Jesus first accuses them of scepticism and then provokes them to fury with a pointed telling of a couple of stories from the scripture. As a result He is thrown out and their hearts are turned against Him.\nAny evangelist that behaves like this deserves to be thrown out and can be sure they will not get a repeat invitation! But isn\u0026rsquo;t Jesus supposed to be our model? John the Baptist did the same, baiting the Pharisees saying \u0026ldquo;who warned you to flee the wrath to come? \u0026quot;\nBoth Jesus and John were more likely to provoke an adverse reaction from their congregation than make an emotional appeal to them.\nJesus says \u0026ldquo;Go home\u0026rdquo; not \u0026ldquo;Come follow me\u0026rdquo; Although this example from Nazareth is more dramatic than the other examples recorded for us, it is nevertheless fairly typical. We assume that if someone actually came to us asking for healing, deliverance or to obtain peace with God, we should urge them follow Jesus. But Jesus never seemed to do so. Usually, after Jesus has engaged with someone in healing, or forgiveness, He tells them to go on their way.\n Jesus asked her, \u0026ldquo;Has no-one condemned you?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;No-one, sir,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Then neither do I condemn you,\u0026rdquo; Jesus declared. \u0026ldquo;Go now and leave your life of sin.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 8:10-11)\n\u0026ldquo;Go,\u0026rdquo; said Jesus, \u0026ldquo;your faith has healed you.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 10:52)\nJesus said to the woman, \u0026ldquo;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 7:50)\n We do know that Jesus called the Twelve to follow Him, but apart from them we are more likely to see Jesus putting people off from following Him:\n \u0026ldquo;He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 10:37-38)\nAs they were walking along the road, a man said to him, \u0026ldquo;I will follow you wherever you go.\u0026rdquo; Jesus replied, \u0026ldquo;Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u0026rdquo; He said to another man, \u0026ldquo;Follow me.\u0026rdquo; But the man replied, \u0026ldquo;Lord, first let me go and bury my father.\u0026rdquo; Jesus said to him, \u0026ldquo;Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\u0026rdquo; Still another said, \u0026ldquo;I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-bye to my family.\u0026rdquo; Jesus replied, \u0026ldquo;No-one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 9:57-62)\nA man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. \u0026ldquo;Good teacher,\u0026rdquo; he asked, \u0026ldquo;what must I do to inherit eternal life?\u0026rdquo; ... Jesus answered ... \u0026ldquo;You know the commandments: \u0026lsquo;Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honour your father and mother.'\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Teacher,\u0026rdquo; he declared, \u0026ldquo;all these I have kept since I was a boy.\u0026rdquo; Jesus looked at him and loved him. \u0026ldquo;One thing you lack,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 10:17-21)\n Jesus seemed to simply trust the Holy Spirit to take the words He had sown through His teaching and to water them until a person decided they had to seek Jesus out and become a disciple. Jesus did all He could to prevent people making spur-of-the-moment emotional responses to the Gospel. If a person did not seek Jesus out and make an effort to become a disciple, they would not become a disciple at all.\nChange your ways Are we to conclude then that Jesus preached a wishy-washy feel-good Gospel and didn\u0026rsquo;t bother with sin and repentance? Not at all. Jesus was quite clear that He came to save sinners, and that repentance was required:\n \u0026ldquo;I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 5:32)\n Jesus even sought out people He had previously healed to warn them to turn from sin:\n Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 5:14)\n\u0026ldquo;Those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them\u0026mdash;do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 13:4-5)\n We know that Jesus\u0026rsquo; Gospel was not a wishy-washy \u0026ldquo;God loves you all. Just smile at the cat and you will get to heaven\u0026rdquo;. Far from it. Jesus\u0026rsquo;s Gospel was so challenging that it led his disciples to ask:\n \u0026quot;Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?\u0026quot; And He said to them, \u0026quot;Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.\u0026quot; (Lk 13:23-24)\n The Proper Response to the Gospel John baptised those who repented as did Jesus' disciples:\n The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptising more disciples than John although in fact it was not Jesus who baptised, but his disciples. (Jn 4:1-2)\n Both the Gospels and Acts tell us that baptism is the appropriate response to the message, not praying some prayer. If a person will not follow up their response to the Gospel with baptism then what is the response worth?\nPurpose, not Method The hundreds of disciples that followed Jesus before his death knew nothing about Jesus dying to save them from their sins. They simply believed that Jesus was sent by God to usher in the new age of the kingdom of God and were baptised on that basis.\nThe underlying mechanism of this new age was not something that Jesus mentioned until the Last Supper. It required Paul in applying his great biblical knowledge and remarkable intellect along with spiritual revelation to bring an explanation of how the good news of the kingdom was brought about by the death and resurrection of the Messiah.\nWe seem to have become fixated on this explanation of the means of our salvation rather than following the focus that Jesus and the rest of the New Testament gives to the Gospel. That focus is on the relationship we can have with God.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s as if we were fixated on the engine under the bonnet of a car, rather than on the car itself. The whole point of a car is to get you from A to B. Of course it is perfectly true that without a reliable engine it won\u0026rsquo;t get you there, but the engine is not the focus. In fact, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to know anything about the engine, nor do you ever have to see it to benefit from its power. The Cross is the essential power of the gospel, but not its point. When we focus on the cross instead of on our relationship with God, we focus on something that Jesus did not.\nDiscipleship is all about relationship with God and a driving desire to develop that relationship. There is no way a person is going to go on with God unless that relationship is an all-important desire. No amount of teaching about heaven and hell will cause a person to deny themselves and follow Jesus. If it is not enough to make a Christian share the Gospel with their friends how could it convince an unbeliever to refocus their entire life around obedience to Jesus?\nConclusion My conclusion from this study is that evangelism should consist mostly of demonstrations of the Kingdom through healing, deliverance and prayers of blessings for people. We should tell people that Jesus came to deliver us from the power of Satan who seeks to destroy our lives and tell them that they can have a personal relationship with God. We should also tell them something of the cost and difficulties of discipleship. If they are interested we can tell them more or invite them to join a Growth Group.\nRemember that if people do not ask, \u0026ldquo;How then can anyone be saved\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Are only a few saved?\u0026rdquo; then we are not preaching as Jesus did! (See Lk 14:26-33 \u0026hellip; unless you \u0026hellip; you cannot be my disciple)\nWe should follow the teaching of the New Testament in offering baptism as the way a person expresses their commitment to Christ, and NOT use the sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer until the moment of baptism.\nIn our evangelistic meetings, having explained about the New Kingdom, we should try to put people off rather than try to persuade them to follow Jesus. We should tell them how they are blinded by Satan and how half-hearted followers make Jesus sick (this should help to put off the proud and arrogant).\nWe should warn them that following Jesus in a selfish and corrupt world is a big challenge that most Christians find difficult. Jesus Himself died on the cross and most of the apostles also died horrible deaths as martyrs. Christians in every age have suffered terrible persecution and shared the common fate of man in the trials and troubles of this world.\nWe also need to be truthful and honest about the realities of our relationship with Jesus. It is not an easy relationship to develop; it takes discipline, determination and courage. We also need to be clear about the joys of that relationship.\nWe should not ask people to respond to the gospel by praying a prayer of commitment. By all means offer a prayer asking God to convict them of their sin and of their need for Him (that is something Jesus said the Holy Spirit would do).\nWe should offer baptism soon after the evangelistic meeting (perhaps the next day or the following week) as a means for people who continue to want to follow Jesus to respond and receive the Holy Spirit. Prior to baptism we should again attempt to put the person off and ensure they understand that coming to Jesus means renouncing all other spirits, ancestor worship, secret societies, attempts to contact the dead, African signs and superstition. Jesus represents the Kingdom of Light where nothing in our lives or hearts is hidden from Him.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"11c07e3cc9d652a5278b216a87340e69","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/the-gospel-jesus-preached/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/the-gospel-jesus-preached/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"The Gospel Jesus Preached The Gospel before the cross Have you ever thought about the fact that the Gospel Jesus proclaimed and acted out all took place before Jesus went to the cross?","tags":null,"title":"The Gospel Jesus Preached","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Gospel of the Kingdom Jesus and the apostles preached and demonstrated a Gospel centred on the Kingdom of God. The cross was not the focus of their Gospel; their focus was the announcement that God's Kingdom had come, and that Jesus was God's appointed and anointed King.\nThe Gospel Jesus Proclaimed Jesus was particularly clear, that He had come to overthrow the kingdom of darkness and establish His Kingdom:\n \u0026ldquo;Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 12:31)\n There can be no doubt that Jesus considered healing and deliverance to be central to His mission. He could have talked about forgiveness, about God's love or God's priority for relationship with Him rather than religious observance. But this is how Jesus described His mission:\n \u0026ldquo;I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 13:32)\n It is very important for us to understand why Jesus healed the sick and drove out demons. Many people have assumed that it was to prove that He was God's Son. But that is not the reason Jesus gives:\n \u0026ldquo;But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 11:20)\n For a fuller understanding of Jesus' Gospel, look at His announcement at the start of His ministry:\n \u0026ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour.\u0026rdquo; ... he began by saying to them, \u0026ldquo;Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 4:16-21 NIV)\n Here we see clearly that the Gospel is about setting people free from the oppression of Satan. It is the announcement of Satan's defeat and God's favour towards His children.\nNotice, that the Gospel is NOT the announcement of warfare against Satan, but the bold assertion and demonstration that he has been bound and defeated:\n \u0026quot;He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.\u0026quot; (Mark 1:27)\n\u0026ldquo;I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 10:18-19)\n\u0026quot;But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man\u0026rsquo;s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.\u0026quot; (Matt 12:28-29)\n It is also important for us to see that Jesus did not claim to be healing and delivering by His own power, as the Messiah, but that it was the Father working in Him:\n \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 10:10)\n So we see clearly that Jesus views the Good News \u0026ndash; the Gospel \u0026ndash; as God's victorious Kingdom now being established on earth, in the lives of God's children. And because of this Jesus makes a wonderful invitation and promise:\n \u0026ldquo;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 11:28-30)\n In this invitation we see a call to repentance (\u0026quot;Come to me...\u0026quot; involves turning away from ones past) and a call to discipleship (\u0026quot;Take my yoke upon you and learn from me\u0026quot;). A Growth Group is the ideal place for someone to respond to this invitation and become a disciple. It is also a very \u0026quot;light burden\u0026quot; compared to telling someone they must go to church.\nThe Gospel the Apostle's Proclaimed There are at least 17 descriptions of the Gospel in the Acts. Here is the complete list with the sermons in bold:\nActs 2:10; Acts 2:17, 21, 23, 36, 38; Acts 4:29-31; Acts 5:41; Acts 7; Acts 8:5-7, 12; Acts 10:36-38, 42-43; Acts 13:32, 38-39; Acts 14:3; Acts 14:15, 22; Acts 16:30-31; Acts 17:7, 16, 18, 30-31; Acts 18:5; Acts 19:8; Acts 20:21; Acts 26:17-18; Acts 28:8-9; Acts 28:23, 31.\nOf these, at least 11 emphasise Jesus as Messiah or King. Only three descriptions of the Gospel include forgiveness of sins! The others emphasise turning to God in faith.\nTwice in Acts we hear what Jesus instructed the apostles to proclaim:\nHe commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. (Acts 10:42-43)\n \u0026quot;I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.\u0026quot; (Acts 26:17-18)\n Again we see a strong Kingdom emphasis. Jesus is the ruler and judge, and people need to turn from the kingdom and power of darkness to the Kingdom of Light and forgiveness. Further insight comes from Paul's preaching in Greece:\n \u0026quot;They are all defying Caesar\u0026rsquo;s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.\u0026quot;... Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. ... \u0026quot;He commands all people everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.\u0026quot; (Acts 17:7, 16, 18, 30-31)\n Although the cross of Christ was vital to the Kingdom of God, the focus of Gospel proclamation is on Jesus as the Messiah/King and the resurrection as the proof that Jesus is alive and reigning.\n Acts 5:41 Day after day from house to house, they never stopped proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.\nActs 8:5-7, 12 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there ... when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.\nActs 28:23, 31 He witnessed to them from morning till evening, explaining about the kingdom of God, ... he tried to persuade them about Jesus. ... He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ.\n Where is the Cross? The New Testament letters make it abundantly clear that the Cross of Christ is how we are forgiven and brought into God's family. Yet the cross rarely appears in the New Testament descriptions or preaching of the Gospel to unbelievers. One way to understand this is to think of the Gospel as a car that can rescue people from a fire or a flood. The Cross is like the engine in the car. Without an engine, a car is useless, no matter how nice it looks inside.\nImagine that we arrive at the scene of disaster and urge people to get into the car so we can take them to safety. We don't need to lift the hood and show them the engine before they get in the car. They don't need to know how the engine works, or anything about it. But without the engine they cannot be saved. After they have been driven to safety, they might want to know what made the car go so fast. Then we can show them the engine and explain how it works.\nThe Gospel would be empty and pointless words without Jesus' death on the Cross and His resurrection. But people don't need to know anything about the Cross in order to be saved. All they need to know is that Jesus is King and Judge and that He loves them and can save them if they repent and put their trust in Him. Later they can learn about the Cross.\nBut an engine needs fuel to power it. Without fuel, the engine is useless. The Holy Spirit is the fuel that powers the Cross. It is by the Holy Spirit that we are Born Again and made into God's children. It is the Holy Spirit that changes people's cold and rebellious hearts and enables them to believe and trust in Jesus.\nThe Gospel is completely dependent upon both the Cross of Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit. But when we share the Gospel with an unbeliever, we do not need to explain either the Cross or the working of the Holy Spirit. Remember that the Gospel is the power of God for salvation (Romans 1:16), not the theological explanation of how God enabled salvation to happen.\nThe Gospel of Power The Gospels and Acts are united in presenting the Gospel as \u0026quot;Jesus has bound Satan and His Kingdom of freedom and forgiveness is here now for those who believe\u0026quot;. When we listen to the Gospels and to Acts we must conclude that the Gospel cannot be separated from healing and deliverance. Paul was insistent that a powerless gospel was no gospel at all:\n \u0026quot;My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit\u0026rsquo;s power, so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God\u0026rsquo;s power.\u0026quot; (1 Cor 2:4-5)\n\u0026quot;The kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.\u0026quot; (1 Cor 4:20)\n And so, when the disciples are praying for effective Gospel witness, they pray for healing:\n Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.\u0026quot; After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly. (Acts 4:29-31)\n And God answered their prayer:\n \u0026quot;The Lord confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders ... (Acts 14:3)\n The Foolishness of the Gospel God has given us intelligence and minds that like to understand the world we live in. It is natural that we try to proclaim the Gospel in a way that makes sense to people, and that sounds reasonable. But our reasoning and intelligence has been corrupted by the fall, so that what is reasonable to God looks like foolishness to us:\n For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. (1 Cor 1:21)\n This very important scripture tells us that people do not get to know God through understanding a reasonable Gospel, but through faith in what seems to be a foolish Gospel.\nPaul is writing about Jesus being crucified as appearing foolish to the Jews and Greeks. But that is not the only aspect of the Gospel that appears foolish:\n \u0026quot;For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.\u0026quot; (Matthew 16:25)\n\u0026quot;Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.\u0026quot; (John 6:53)\n\u0026quot;If anyone says to this mountain, \u0026lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,\u0026rsquo; and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.\u0026quot; (Mark 11:23)\n Jesus said many things that appear foolish to the natural mind:\n The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. (1 Cor 2:14)\n We have seen in this study that Jesus instructs us to preach healing for the sick as the starting point for the Gospel, but this appears foolish to us because not everyone we pray for is healed immediately \u0026ndash; they may not be healed at all. Preaching sight for the blind when the blind remain blind makes us appear foolish. But we must accept that Jesus' wisdom is greater than our foolishness. We must continue to proclaim the gospel Jesus gave us, because that foolish Gospel is the power of God for salvation to those who are being saved.\nThe Gospel Explained Having highlighted the foolishness of the Gospel, we must not deny the importance of explanation. Jesus almost certainly spent more time talking and explaining than healing, as did the apostles:\n Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. (Acts 18:5)\nPaul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. (Acts 19:8)\nA young man named Eutychus sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. (Acts 20:9)\n Talking and explaining things clearly are very important. Understanding the things of God is important. But truth is not defined by what seems reasonable to us. \u0026quot;Let God be true, and every man a liar.\u0026quot; (Romans 3:4). We must remember:\n \u0026quot;The kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.\u0026quot; (1 Cor 4:20)\n Our Gospel So where does this leave us? We must be honest and admit that we have mostly reversed Pauls' claim and said, \u0026quot;The kingdom of God is not a matter of power but of talk.\u0026quot; This is surely our biggest challenge \u0026ndash; for pastors and for every disciple of Jesus. Will we commit ourselves to pursuing the Gospel of the Kingdom \u0026ndash; the \u0026quot;foolish\u0026quot; Gospel of Powerful deliverance and healing and transformation? Or will we settle for a \u0026quot;reasonable\u0026quot; gospel of words and well-wishing?\nWe must NOT fall into the trap of thinking that understanding and explaining the gospel is the same as genuine proclamation. We are only being obedient to Jesus' command and commission if we proclaim the Gospel of the Kingdom with healing and deliverance.\nHaving said this, we must continue to be honest and admit that most of us experience a great deal of frustration and failure in this respect. That is why this question is so important. Will we give up and accept defeat, or keep trying because obedience and trust is more important to us than our own comfort?\nThis is where leadership and fellowship are so important. Let us commit together to proclaim the Gospel of the Kingdom, with healing and deliverance and to keep at it until we hear Jesus say, \u0026quot;Well done, good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of your Master.\u0026quot;\nThe Gospel in Four Words Freedom: God wants to break the power of evil over your life and set you free to know His love for you.\nJesus: He sent His Son Jesus to show us the way and make this possible.\nRepentance: He invites you to turn from your own ways and put your trust completely in Him.\nBaptism: If you want to make this complete change in your life, you must die to what you have been and let God give you His new life. We call this baptism...\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4c866f3a1558f08d3bc636a68e305c1b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/evangelism/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/evangelism/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"The Gospel of the Kingdom Jesus and the apostles preached and demonstrated a Gospel centred on the Kingdom of God.

That is why we educate ourselves. It is why people want to go to university. It is why people vote in elections. It is why we take risks. Without hope we would just give up and die!\nEvery culture offers its own pathway to a better future. In traditional rural cultures it often involves ancestor worship and sacrificial offerings. In tribal cultures it often involves obtaining a dominant position over competing tribes. In religious cultures it usually involves some sort of self-cleansing and penance. In secular cultures it often involves the accumulation of wealth and the domination of others.\nThe point is that there are many different ways in which people seek to improve their lives. God is also interested in this. He created us, loves us and wants our lives to be fruitful and blessed. He wants your life to be fruitful and blessed.\nFrustrated by Sin But our lives are made difficult because of sin. The sin of countless generations before us has created great injustice and imbalance in the world. The sin of our governments has resulted in broken economies and widespread injustice. Sin in our communities results in people being cheated and ill-treated. Sin in our families results in arguments and fights and deep emotional pain. We have individually and corporately messed up our world and our own lives.\nSo where do we turn for help and guidance? We look to our own reason \u0026ndash; trying to make sense of the situation and work out a way forward. We turn to our family and friends for advice. We turn to our culture and traditions for wisdom. We look both inward and outward to the things we can perceive and try to make the best choice we can. But God is not far from any of us. And He sees what we can never see. He also sees the big-picture; how our actions affect those around us and those who will come after us.\nLight from Above The Good News of the Gospel is that God has broken into our dark and confused world by sending His Son Jesus to live and die as a man. He was rejected by many and suffered terrible injustice, resulting in His murder by being nailed to a tree and left to die. But God raised Him up from death and Jesus is now alive and reigns over the Kingdom of God all over the world today.\nWe can choose to continue to try and find our own way, as we always have done, or we can put our trust in God and follow Jesus' way. But we cannot pick and choose. Jesus does not just offer a few other choices we can pick from. If we want the light of Jesus in our lives we need to turn our backs on all other voices and listen only to Jesus.\nThat is Jesus' call \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Repent; turn around. Believe the Truth that is Jesus Christ. Turn your back on all other claims of wisdom and light and trust only in Jesus as your Light.\u0026rdquo;\nBecoming a child of God God welcomes all who put their whole trust in Jesus. We need to become God\u0026rsquo;s children through being baptised in water and baptised in the Holy Spirit. In the water we die to our old way of living and thinking and all the sin and curses of our past are cut off forever. Then we rise up as a new person, God\u0026rsquo;s holy child, and receive the transforming and empowering Holy Spirit. He becomes our teacher and guide.\nThe Narrow Way Living in the Light of Jesus is counter-cultural. It often leads to great blessing but it also leads to great challenges; Jesus was rejected and killed! This is not the easy path, but it is God\u0026rsquo;s way of love which brings freedom and healing to our broken world. God dwells in His children to enable them to bring Jesus' love and healing to others.

Then, about 4000 years ago, God revealed Himself to a man called Abraham and gave him a promise, that God would bless him and through Abraham, God would bless the whole world. The story of what happed to Abraham and his descendants is very interesting and important because God used them to create a story which shows us how we too can come to know God and share in the promise God gave to Abraham\n that God will bless us and make us a blessing to others.  He told Abraham to leave his home and travel to a distant land which God would give to his descendants - that was the land we now call Israel. Abraham had a son, Isaac and Isaac had a son called Jacob and Jacob had twelve sons who became the fathers of the twelve tribes of Israel. Then because of a great famine the whole family moved to Egypt where there was fertile farmland, and there they became a great people. But because of their number and prosperity they were enslaved by the Egyptians.\nSo God revealed Himself to a man called Moses and used him to lead the people out of slavery. Their enslavement had been a gradual process which they had adjusted to and many were prepared to accept in return for the security it gave them. Moses had quite a task to persuade his fellow Israelites that they should leave all this behind and risk an uncertain journey to an unknown destination for the promise of a better future.\nGod planned for this historical physical journey to be a picture of the spiritual journey each of us is invited to make from living in the \u0026quot;kingdom\u0026quot; of the world to becoming one of God's people, living here on earth as part of God's Kingdom.\nMoses led the Israelites out of Egypt, pursued by the Egyptian army. God miraculously parted the Red Sea to let the Israelites through, but the Egyptian army was drowned. By going through the Red Sea the people were cut off from their past and their slavery was ended. From there, Moses led the people into the land God had originally promised to Abraham.\nAlthough the people were now free from the Egyptians and living in their own land, they were not free from the corruption of their human nature. The strong and powerful took advantage of the poor and weak. Selfishness and greed played their familiar part and for the most part they ignored God and lived lives that were just as messed up and unhappy as they had been in Egypt. The people had many religious practices but none of these impressed God. God wanted His people to love one another and provide justice for the oppressed and mercy for those who had messed up but wanted to reform their lives.\nThroughout the years since Abraham, God had sent prophets saying that one day God would send a special messenger who would give us a new way of knowing God. That messenger was Jesus, and the new way of knowing God was through having our hearts changed by God. With changed hearts obedience to God's good ways would become natural for us and we would have the courage to stand against wrong. Wonderful as this message sounded, it was not going to be well received by the rich and powerful leaders of Israel.\nJesus' life and His message would mirror the journey of the Israelites fleeing Egypt. Jesus preached very boldly about things which made people feel very uncomfortable - and they still do. Jesus said that this world was under the influence of the Devil; He called it the \u0026quot;Kingdom of Darkness\u0026quot; and contrasted it with God's kingdom, the \u0026quot;Kingdom of Light\u0026quot;. Jesus came as Light from God to show people the way out of Darkness into God's Kingdom, of Light, just like Moses had led Israel out of slavery in Egypt into the Promised Land. Jesus also spoke often about a coming day of Justice, like a global court-hearing when everyone of us, whether living or long-since dead, would be called to answer to God for how we have lived our lives. Jesus said that those who love Truth need have no fear of coming to Jesus and becoming part of God's Kingdom, but those who want to hide their lives from God would flee His presence. Jesus made it very clear that it was not religious people that pleased God, but obedient people; people who believed that Jesus was God Himself come as a man, and who allowed Jesus the King to influence and direct their lives for the blessing of others. It was through Jesus and those who become His disciples today that God would fulfil the original promise He made to Abraham; that God would bless him and through him bless the whole world. And that, in a nut-shell is what it means to be a Christian; to become one of God's people through obedience to Jesus, so that we can receive God's abundant blessings and share those blessings with those around us.\nHowever, the religious leaders of Jesus' day did not like the way He was challenging their cosy self-serving hypocrisy and they staged a kangaroo court with trumped-up charges and had Jesus executed by nailing Him to a cross. But God raised Jesus from the grave and after meeting with more than 500 people over a period of 40 days, Jesus was taken into God's presence where He lives and reigns as the King of the Kingdom of God.\nWe have nearly, but not quite reached the end of the story. The prophets had said that when God's special messenger came, He would also change people's hearts. Jesus said this would happen after He returned to Heaven when God would pour the Holy Spirit into the hearts of those who lived with Jesus as their King. This happened to the first disciples, transforming them from fearful nobodies into bold witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus and of His power to heal and transform lives. Sadly, countless people have misrepresented Jesus by turning his message into one of joyless religious observance. Nevertheless, the transforming power of the Holy Spirit is still available for all who want to turn from the kingdom of Darkness to God's Kingdom of Light. Jesus said that in order to live in God's light we must leave behind our old way of living (just like the Israelites leaving Egypt), put our trust in Jesus (like the Israelites following Moses), be baptised in water (like the Israelites passing through the Red Sea) and then be baptized in the Holy Spirit. He promises then to set us free from our past (like the Egyptian Army drowning in the Red Sea) and lead us by His empowering Spirit into an adventure with Jesus (like the Israelites entering the Promised Land), where we learn to live like Him and do what He did.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3104ddaf90568eb1c2300e2a20c0b968","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/evangelism/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom-for-jews/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/organic-church/evangelism/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom-for-jews/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"The Gospel of the Kingdom The Gospel for the Jews Throughout human existence, people have mostly either worshipped false gods, or tried to ignore God, but it seems that God has always revealed Himself to a few people.","tags":null,"title":"The Gospel of the Kingdom for Jews","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Letter to the Galatians: Exegesis and Theology\n(Originally published in Between Two Horizons: Spanning New Testament Studies and Systematic Theology Joel B. Green and Max Turner, eds., 2000, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 205\u0026ndash;36. Reproduced by permission of the author.)\nN. T. WRIGHT\nThe dense and dramatic argument of Galatians excites and baffles by turns. Sometimes perceived as a flamboyant younger sister of the more settled and reflective letter to Rome, this epistle has provoked endless controversy at all levels, from details of exegesis to flights of systematic theology. Nobody reading it can be in any doubt that it all mattered very much indeed to Paul. But what it was that mattered, and why, and why it should matter to anyone two thousand years later \u0026mdash; these are far harder questions to answer. Nor can this chapter do more than restate the questions and hint at possible answers. Our aim here is not to solve the problems in question but to discuss and illustrate the task.\nOur aim is to discuss, particularly, what might happen when we allow questions of exegesis and theology to stare each other in the face. It is of course generally recognized that anyone grappling with the exegesis of Galatians must do business with \u0026ldquo;theological\u0026rdquo; questions. One must, that is to say, know something of the grammar of theological concepts, how God-language works (particularly, how it worked in the first century), how justification might relate to law and faith, and so on. One must, in particular, be familiar with how Paul uses similar ideas in other letters, in this case especially Romans. It is not that one should allow Paul\u0026rsquo;s meaning in one place to determine ahead of time what he might have said elsewhere, but that even if development, or a change of mind, has occurred, we are still dealing with the same person talking about more or less the same things. Equally, no systematic or practical theology that would claim to be Christian can ignore the central and foundational texts of the NT. Particularly, anyone offering a theological account of, say, justification would feel bound at least to make a visit to Galatians and to fit it somehow into the developing scheme. And anyone wanting to offer a serious Christian account of central topics on contemporary applied theology \u0026mdash; liberation, for instance, or postmodernity \u0026mdash; ought, if such theology is to be fully Christian, to ground their reflections in the NT.\nHowever, a good deal of historical and exegetical scholarship on this letter, as on others, has in fact proceeded in recent decades with only minimal attention to theological discussion \u0026mdash; an omission sometimes justified on the grounds of maintaining historical neutrality, though sometimes in fact masking the historian\u0026rsquo;s unawareness of the deeper issues involved. Likewise, many systematic theologians, in this and other fields, have become impatient with waiting for the mountain of historical footnotes to give birth to the mouse of theological insight, and have proceeded on the basis of an understanding of the text that simply reflects, it may not be too unkind to say, either the commentary that was in vogue when the theologian was a student or the pressing contemporary issues that condition a particular reading of the text.[[1]]{.ul}\nI intend in this essay to approach the problem from both ends, and to examine the bridge that might be thrown between these two now traditional positions. This task is not to be thought of as one element in the wider project of bridging Lessing\u0026rsquo;s Ugly Ditch. Such a project presupposes that which ought to be challenged \u0026mdash; namely, the existence of such a ditch in the first place. To be sure, a ditch between the historical and the theological task does indeed exist within Western consciousness, and the rise of historical scholarship owes something to it, since in that context the ditch has acted as a moat, protecting the historian from the prying eye and the heavy hand of the theological censor. But the question always arises as to who is being protected from whom. The ditch is equally useful to those who want to maintain a traditional faith within a pure ahistorical vacuum. But the idea that there is a great gulf fixed between historical exegesis and Christian theology \u0026mdash; this Enlightenment presupposition is precisely what ought to be challenged, not least when commenting on a biblical text.\nOne way of hinting at answers to the wider problems is to read a particular text without bracketing off any of these questions \u0026mdash; or, to put the matter another way, one might propose putting to the text the questions that have accrued, and those that are newly emerging, out of the long history of the church\u0026rsquo;s engagement with its own faith (and, one should say, with its God) \u0026mdash; and giving the text a chance to answer them, or at least to insist on their rewording. With this in mind, I offer here (1) a brief account of the major exegetical issues that meet us in Galatians; (2) a suggestion of which major theological questions might profitably be put to the letter, and what answers might arise; and (3) some proposals about how these two tasks might be brought into fruitful interaction with one another through the work of a commentary and the further work (not least preaching) that a commentary is supposed to evoke.\n1. Exegetical Issues\nThe basic task of exegesis is to address, as a whole and in parts, the historical questions: What was the author saying to the readers; and why? These questions ultimately demand an answer at the broadest level in the form of a hypothesis to be tested against the verse-by-verse details. One may, perhaps, allow the author some imprecision, particularly in such a heated composition, but if even a small number of details do not fit the hypothesis, it will be called into question. Exegetes of course have ways of making things fit. A puzzling verse can be labeled as a pre-Pauline fragment or an interpolation, or perhaps a mere \u0026ldquo;topos\u0026rdquo; in which a well-worn phrase, whose history-of-religions ancestry can be shown with an impressive footnote, should not be pressed for precise or powerful meaning. (As though Paul, of all people, would be content to write a letter that was merely a set of conventional noises whose meaning could thus be reduced to a set of evocative grunts!) Failing that, one can suggest that a puzzling verse simply reflects a moment where either Paul or his amanuensis lost the train of thought. But I take it as a general rule, consonant with the wider rules for hypotheses and their verification, that the more moves like this one makes, the more one\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis stands condemned for lack of appropriate simplicity. One must assume that there is a train of thought, \u0026ldquo;that the text has a central concern and a remarkable inner logic that may no longer be entirely comprehensible to us.\u0026quot;[[2]]{.ul} One must get in the data, and one must do so without undue complexity, without using that brute force which swaggers around the byways of a text arm-in-arm with ignorance.\nAt the level of large-scale exegesis, this problem meets us when we ask the questions normally thought of under the heading \u0026ldquo;Introduction.\u0026rdquo; What was going on in Galatia that made Paul write the letter? Which \u0026ldquo;Galatia\u0026rdquo; (north or south) are we talking about anyway? When did Paul write the letter? What relation, if any, did the episode have to the so-called \u0026ldquo;apostolic conference\u0026rdquo; of Acts 15? Who were Paul\u0026rsquo;s opponents, the shadowy \u0026ldquo;agitators\u0026rdquo; who flit to and fro through the undergrowth of the epistle?\nOne well-worn path through these thickets has been made by those who insist that the agitators are legalists: proto-Pelagians who are trying to persuade the Galatians to seek justification by performing good moral deeds. Among the many problems this view faces is the question, Why then does Paul spend so long, in chapter 5 in particular, warning the Galatians against what looks like antinomianism? It will scarcely do to say (though many have) that he has suddenly focused on a quite different problem, with perhaps a quite different set of opponents or agitators. A different basic analysis seems called for \u0026mdash; one that will hold the two emphases of the letter (if that is what they are) in a single larger context, and that will perhaps question whether what appear to our post-Enlightenment and post-Reformation eyes as two separate, almost incompatible, emphases, would have appeared like that to either Paul or his readers. And any such analysis must face the question from the theologian, and from those (such as preachers) who look to theologians' work for help: Of what use are these \u0026ldquo;introductory\u0026rdquo; questions for theology? Since two hundred years of research has failed to solve them, is there not something to be said for bracketing them and going straight into reading the text?\nA similarly large-scale question to be addressed is, Why does Paul spend so long recounting his early visits to Jerusalem and his meeting with the apostles there? Almost one-quarter of the letter (1:10-2:21, 36 verses out of 149) is devoted to this subject, and there may be further echoes of the subject elsewhere (e.g., 4:25). Many readers have, of course, bypassed this question, regarding material prior to 2:11 as \u0026ldquo;introduction\u0026rdquo; and seeing what follows as the beginning of a systematic theological exposition of the doctrine of justification. But Paul at least reckoned it necessary to preface the body of the letter with this introduction rather than something else; and, since his introductions are normally good indicators of the main thrust of the letter, we should at least make the attempt to investigate the possible integration of the first two chapters with what follows.\nA question that relates to this but has recently taken on a life of its own (particularly since the appearance twenty-five years ago of the commentary by H.-D. Betz) is, To what rhetorical genre does the letter belong?[[3]]{.ul} Is it deliberative, apologetic, or what?[[4]]{.ul} It has, I believe, been good for Pauline exegetes to be reminded that Paul wrote from within the wider world of Greco-Roman late antiquity, where there were well-known literary forms and genres that would, in themselves, give off clues as to what the writer thought he (or, less likely, she) was doing. But it is important not to let the literary tail wag the epistolary dog. Paul was an innovator, living in two or more worlds at once, and allowing them \u0026mdash; in his own person, his vocation, his style of operation, and his writing \u0026mdash; to knock sparks off each other (or, as it might be, to dovetail together in new ways). Consideration of literary genre must always remain in dialogue with the question of what the text actually says. Neither can claim the high ground and dictate to the other. The same is true of the various forms of structural, or structuralist, analysis.\nSimilar points need to be made about the current burgeoning of social-scientific reading of Paul\u0026rsquo;s letters.[[5]]{.ul} To be sure, Paul and his readers lived within a social context in which all sorts of pressures and presuppositions operated that are quite unlike those in modern Western society. A good many things that have traditionally been read as abstract ideas or beliefs did in fact come with heavy agendas attached in the areas of social grouping, organization, and culture, and we ignore this at our peril. Equally, recognizing the existence and nonnegotiable importance of the social-scientific dimension of Paul\u0026rsquo;s letters does not mean denying that these same letters set out a train of thought that cannot, or at least cannot a priori, be reduced to terms of cryptic social agendas. Just because every word and phrase carries a social context and dimension does not mean that Paul is not setting out a train of thought, a sequence of ideas. We must beware, here as elsewhere, of false antitheses.\nThese are exactly the sorts of questions, once more, that will tend to make the theologian impatient. Of what relevance, people sometimes say and often think, are these questions for the major and urgent issues that crowd in upon the church and its proclamation to the world? The answer is that each of them demonstrably affects how we read the key texts for which the theologian or preacher is eager. The question of justification by faith itself is intimately bound up with them. Ernst Käsemann\u0026rsquo;s caustic remark, that those eager for \u0026ldquo;results\u0026rdquo; should keep their hands off exegesis, comes uncomfortably to mind.[[6]]{.ul}\nThe influence of social context upon exegesis and theology is most obviously the case with the passage where many will feel that the letter finally \u0026ldquo;gets going\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; namely, 2:11-21. The brief and dense statement about justification in 2:15-21 is part of Paul\u0026rsquo;s description of what happened between Peter and himself at Antioch; we cannot assume, as many have done, that because we think we know ahead of time what Paul meant by \u0026ldquo;justification,\u0026rdquo; we can deduce that precisely this was the subject of the quarrel (imagining, for instance, that Peter was arguing for a semi-Pelagian position on the question of how people go to heaven after death). Paul\u0026rsquo;s description of the altercation pushes us in quite another direction. The question at issue was not, How can individual sinners find salvation? but rather, Are Christian Jews bound, by the Jewish kosher laws, to eat separately from Christian Gentiles, or are they bound by the gospel to eat at the same table with them? We may and must assume, indeed, that reflection on these questions would not only be influenced, in the minds of Peter and the others, by \u0026ldquo;pure\u0026rdquo; intellectual and theological arguments; Paul was asking them to break the habits not only of a lifetime but of a tightly integrated social grouping that had survived, precisely by maintaining these habits, for hundreds of years. The detailed exegetical debates that have swirled around these verses have, as often as not, been caused by a sense that the traditional reading does not quite work, does not quite fit the words that Paul actually used. Attention to the wider context on the one hand, and to theological issues of how the basic concepts function in general and in Paul in particular, may provide fresh ways forward. And if that is so, a Careful reading of this passage in Galatians might well send shock waves through the reading of other Pauline texts, such as Romans 3-4 and Philippians 3.\nThe long argument of 3:1-5:1, which forms the solid center of the letter, offers almost endless puzzles for the exegete, down to the meaning of individual words and particles and the question of implicit punctuation (the early manuscripts, of course, have for the most part neither punctuation nor breaks between words). And it is here that the larger issues of understanding Galatians, the questions that form the bridge between exegesis, history, and theology, begin to come to light. Where does Paul suppose that he stands in relationship to the covenant that Israel\u0026rsquo;s God made with Abraham? And to that with Moses? And to the Torah, the Jewish law, which, though giving substance to the historical Mosaic covenant, seems to have taken on a life of its own? What, in short, does Paul wish to say about what he himself, surprisingly perhaps, calls \u0026ldquo;Judaism\u0026rdquo; (1:13)? Does he see it as a historical sequence of covenants and promises that have now reached their fulfillment in Jesus? Or does he see it as a system to the whole of which the true God is now saying \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; in order to break in, through the gospel, and do a new thing? A further important question, not usually considered sufficiently: Does Paul\u0026rsquo;s actual handling of the Jewish Scriptures, in terms of quotation, allusion, and echo, reflect the view he holds, or do the two stand in tension?[[7]]{.ul}\nThese questions can, of course, only be resolved by detailed examination of the text, verse by verse and line by line. But it is important to notice here the way in which, classically within the discipline of Pauline scholarship, two questions, in principle separable, have in fact been fused together in uncomfortable coexistence. (1) What is Paul\u0026rsquo;s theological relationship to Judaism? (2) What is Paul\u0026rsquo;s historical relationship to Judaism? The two have often been allowed to spill over into each other. Thus, if Paul is perceived to have criticized \u0026ldquo;Judaism\u0026rdquo; (e.g., for its belief in justification by works of the law), it is assumed that he cannot have derived his basic ideas from Judaism \u0026mdash; and that therefore the historical origin of his theology is to be found not in Judaism at all, but either in the Christ event as a totally new and essentially non-Jewish irruption into the world or in the pagan systems of religion, cult, and moral philosophy. Conversely, if Paul is perceived to stand in a positive relation to Judaism at the historical level \u0026mdash; i.e., if one supposes that Paul\u0026rsquo;s basic thought structure and beliefs remained Jewish after his conversion \u0026mdash; it is often assumed that therefore he can have had no real critique of \u0026ldquo;Judaism.\u0026rdquo; Both of these questions, of course, need integration with wider issues, not least Paul\u0026rsquo;s actual practice in its social setting.\nAnyone who wishes thus to skate to and fro between history of religions and theological analysis should be warned that the ice here is dangerously thin. Among the key characteristics of Paul\u0026rsquo;s Judaism were precisely critique from within on the one hand and confrontation with paganism on the other. The fact that Paul criticized some aspects of his native Judaism and that he announced a gospel to the Gentiles does not mean that he broke with Judaism in order to do so. On the contrary; by his own account (to hint for a moment at the solution that I prefer), he claimed to be speaking as a true Jew, criticizing \u0026mdash; as did many who made similar claims \u0026mdash; those who embraced other construals of Judaism, on the basis that Israel\u0026rsquo;s God had now acted climactically and decisively in Jesus, the Messiah. For the same reason, he was now announcing to all the world that the one true God was addressing, claiming, and redeeming it by the Jewish Messiah, the Lord of the world.\nThis discussion should be sufficient to show the way in which the exegetical and theological issues that arise from Galatians 3 and 4 are bound so closely together that it is impossible to separate them. But we should also note the way in which such deliberations have also invoked, from various angles, the wider contexts both of theology and of contemporary meaning. In the church\u0026rsquo;s preaching, the assumption that Paul was straightforwardly distancing himself from \u0026ldquo;Judaism\u0026rdquo; has had, notoriously, disastrous effects at social, cultural, political, and theological levels. Equally, if it is supposed for a moment that Paul simply saw himself as a good Jew who merely knew the name of the Messiah, but otherwise had nothing to add to his Jewish heritage, all chance of understanding him is lost. The only way of dealing with Galatians 3 and 4 is for all these issues to be on the table at the same time.\nThe exegetical problem(s) of Galatians 5 and 6 grow out of, and contribute further to, these questions, but add extra ones of their own. Lulled perhaps by a belief that Paul follows the Enlightenment\u0026rsquo;s division of theory and practice, of theology and ethics, many have simply supposed that the \u0026ldquo;theology\u0026rdquo; of the letter is now finished and that all that remains are some guidelines as to how to behave. But to approach the chapters thus is to be further puzzled. Paul does not say quite what (from this perspective) we would expect. His key statements are not of the form \u0026ldquo;this, then, is how to behave,\u0026rdquo; but instead things like \u0026ldquo;if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law\u0026rdquo; (5:18) and \u0026ldquo;those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh\u0026rdquo; (5:24). The detailed instructions of 6:1-10 (which, if they have a connecting theme, are still not so tightly sewn together as the previous argument) continue to refer not to a general need for the Galatians to behave in a proper fashion, but rather to a particular social situation within which certain styles of behavior are particularly appropriate. And the letter closes with a strong statement of the basic point that, arguably, Paul has been making all through: Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters, since what matters is new creation. What, then, does Paul\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;ethics,\u0026rdquo; if we should call it that, have to do with the fundamental thrust of the letter as a whole? This exegetical problem is of course of huge interest to theologians, but it will not be solved by broad generalizations that sit loose to the detail of the text, or to its historical and social origins.\n2. Contributions to Systematic Theology\nAfter this brief review of the exegetical problems of the letter, it is now time to approach the matter from the other end. What theological issues might we hope to see advanced by the study of this text, and what problems face us as we press such questions? We shall maintain, for the purpose of this article, a traditional distinction between \u0026ldquo;systematic\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;practical\u0026rdquo; theology, although in today\u0026rsquo;s practice such things are increasingly merged together. In both cases all we can do is to note some possible questions out of the many that could arise, and to suggest some possible answers. The object of the exercise here is to be exemplary rather than in any way exhaustive.\nWe have already mentioned justification, and the interrelation of theology and ethics (with its subset, the interrelation between justification by faith and life in the Spirit). These are not the major questions that systematic theologians have struggled with throughout the history of the church; indeed, Paul himself is capable of writing letters in which one or both play little or no role. But we cannot imagine Paul writing a letter in which Jesus Christ played no part, or in which the purpose and nature of the one true God were not under consideration; and these are of course the central subject matter of traditional Christian systematic theology.\nWhat, first, does Paul have to say in Galatians that will address the traditional questions about God? Such questions concern, for instance, the identity and description of God, or a god; how knowledge of this god is to be had (whether innate in humans, specially revealed, or whatever); the relationship of this god to the world; the power and operation of the god, not least his or her activity within the world; what one can say about evil in the world, and what (if anything) this god might be doing about it; the nature of human being and existence; the question of appropriate human behavior. Allowing Paul to address these questions from his own angles, we can at once make the following observations, which, though quite obvious, are not always highlighted.\nFirst, the god of whom Paul speaks is without question the one God of Israel, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This God is the creator of the world, and pagan idols are shams, or demons in disguise. Even if Paul sometimes seems to be saying that the God of Israel has behaved in an unforeseen, perhaps an unpredictable, maybe even an unprincipled, fashion, it is still the God of Israel he is talking about. We should expect Paul therefore to be on the map of first-century Jewish thought about God \u0026mdash; and this is indeed the case, though not always in the ways one might imagine. When we glance across at the other Pauline letters, and out into the rest of the NT, we find at this point a remarkable unanimity. Despite two millennia of Jewish protest to the contrary, the NT writers, with Paul leading the way chronologically, firmly believe themselves to be writing about, worshiping, and following the will of the one God of Israel, and rejecting paganism.\nSecond, in line with this, Paul believes that this God has a purpose for the created world. More specifically, he believes that \u0026ldquo;the present evil age\u0026rdquo; will give way, in God\u0026rsquo;s good time, to \u0026ldquo;the age to come,\u0026rdquo; in which Israel and the world will be redeemed from the power of the false gods. This apocalyptic belief was widespread in Paul\u0026rsquo;s Jewish world, certainly in sectarian Judaism but also in groups that would not have thought of themselves in that way. This belief is not, or at least not necessarily, \u0026ldquo;dualistic\u0026rdquo;; indeed, insofar as it envisages the present world being set to rights rather than being abandoned, it emphasizes the goodness and God-givenness of creation, while allowing fully, perhaps too fully sometimes, for creation\u0026rsquo;s having been invaded, taken over, distorted, and deceived by forces of evil and destruction. Paul\u0026rsquo;s understanding of God in Galatians includes the belief that the true God has broken into the world, in the person of Jesus and the power of the Spirit of Jesus, to usher in the long-awaited new age and so to redeem Israel and the world (cf. esp. 1:4). Here too Paul is in fundamental agreement with the other NT writers.\nThird, this God is revealed and known in the Jewish Scriptures, in actions within history through which the scriptural promises are fulfilled, and climactically in the coming of the Messiah. The apocalyptic intervention of God in Israel and the world, sweeping aside all that stands in the way of the dawning new day, is paradoxically for Paul the completion, the fulfillment, and the climax of all that God had done and said to and for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.[[8]]{.ul} The dense and difficult discussions of the Jewish law in Galatians owe their very existence to the fact that Paul is unwilling to declare, as many theologians since his day have done, that the Jewish law was shabby or second-rate, or even demonic and dangerous. He is determined to insist, despite the problems he is storing up for later readers, both that God gave the law and accomplished his purposes through it and that the Galatians must not submit to it, since it was given a specific role for a certain period of time that has now come to an end. Eschatology, not religious critique, is what counts. To dissolve the resultant paradox one way or another is a sure way of misunderstanding Paul.\nIt is sometimes said that Galatians has a negative view of the law, and Romans a positive one; it would be truer to say that in both letters Paul wrestles mightily with this paradox, to address very different situations and contexts. It would be truer, thus, to find a deep compatibility within the two that, when discovered, will reach out further to embrace such other statements as 2 Corinthians 3 and Philippians 3. This eschatological reading of Paul\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the Scriptures in general and the law in particular is the necessary corrective to any idea that Paul is speaking in the abstract, either about \u0026ldquo;law\u0026rdquo; in general or about the Jewish law in a timeless way. His thought is controlled throughout by the sense of God\u0026rsquo;s purpose within and beyond history, and of where he and his readers belong within that story.\nAll of this leads, of course, to the second area of major importance for systematic theology to which Galatians might be supposed to make some contribution. What does Paul say about Jesus? Merely collecting the relevant isolated verses does not address the question. We need to discover what role Jesus plays within Paul\u0026rsquo;s ongoing arguments. As I have urged elsewhere, the basic answer for Paul is that Jesus is the Messiah of Israel, in whom the promises made to the patriarchs have finally come true.[[9]]{.ul} In particular, his death has solved the problem of evil that lay heavily upon the world in general and, because of the warnings and curses of the covenant, upon Israel in particular. Though Paul mentions the death of Jesus dozens of times in his writings, he never says exactly the same thing twice (though the phrase \u0026ldquo;died for us\u0026rdquo; or something similar is a regular refrain); he allows the specific needs of each argument to determine what particular meaning he will draw out in each case. Underlying each of these, however, is Paul\u0026rsquo;s deeper meaning of messiahship, visible in (for instance) Galatians 2:17-21: The Messiah represents his people, so that what is true of him becomes true of them. His death becomes their death, and they find their new life within his. Underlying this, and I believe foundational for Paul\u0026rsquo;s thinking about what we call \u0026ldquo;atonement\u0026rdquo; theology, is the belief that what God does for Israel is done not for Israel only, but for the whole world. Israel\u0026rsquo;s Messiah is the world\u0026rsquo;s Lord; the crucified, saving Messiah who brings Jews out of their real exile is the crucified Lord who by the same means rescues pagans from their bondage to nongods. This, I suggest, is the clue to that \u0026ldquo;incorporative\u0026rdquo; Christology that is so frequently discussed, and of which 3:23-29 provides such a good, though complex, example.\nHidden within the category of messiahship, in Paul\u0026rsquo;s construction of it, is a deeper belief about Jesus which, so far as we know, was not held by any non-Christian Jews in relation to any of the would-be Messiahs who make their brief appearances in the tragic story of first-century Judaism. Drawing on the occasional but important biblical statements about the Messiah being the adopted son of Israel\u0026rsquo;s God (e.g., Pss. 2:7; 89:27; 2 Sam. 7:14). Paul describes Jesus as the unique son of God, sent from God to effect the divine purpose \u0026mdash; i.e., the purpose that in Scripture Israel\u0026rsquo;s God reserves to himself \u0026mdash; of redeeming his people and thereby saving the whole world from destructive demonic powers. Thus, almost casually within this letter, written within at most twenty-five years of Jesus' crucifixion, we come upon what with hindsight we may see as the first steps toward trinitarian language (4:1-11). The God whom Christians worship is the Jewish God, the God of Abraham, of the exodus (exodus language, and the retelling of the exodus story, permeate this context), and of Wisdom (the figure of \u0026ldquo;wisdom\u0026rdquo; is of course in some Jewish texts \u0026mdash; e.g., Wis. 10:15-21 \u0026mdash; a way of talking about the God of the exodus); but this God is now to be known as the God who sends the Son. and who then sends the Spirit of his Son. And it is to this God alone that the Galatians must give full allegiance; otherwise they will slide back to a state similar to what they were in before. You must either have the triune God, Paul is saying, or you must have a form of paganism.\nThis early form of proto-trinitarian theology thus appears as a variant within Jewish monotheism, not a form of crypto-paganism. Exactly like classic Jewish monotheism, it stands opposed both to paganism and to dualism. Just as Israel\u0026rsquo;s God made himself known as such in the exodus, fulfilling the promises to Abraham and calling Israel his son, so this same God has now revealed himself fully and finally in the new exodus of Jesus' death and resurrection, fulfilling the promises to Abraham in their widest sense, challenging and defeating the pagan powers that had kept humanity as a whole under lock and key. To go back to allowing one\u0026rsquo;s self-understanding, corporately or individually, to be determined by ethnic boundary markers rather than by the new life given in the Messiah is therefore to embrace again a form of paganism, however paradoxical this may seem when what one thought one was doing was taking on the yoke of the Jewish Torah. A good case can be made for seeing this critique underlying many of Paul\u0026rsquo;s other statements about the Torah, not least in Romans.\nTalking about God and Jesus in relation to Galatians has thus inevitably embroiled us in talking about the plight of Israel and the world. Paul, in this letter and everywhere else, takes it as axiomatic that all human beings are under the power and rule of sin, and that the Jewish Torah, so far from releasing people from this state, merely exacerbates it. It is quite wrong to say, as has often been done in recent scholarship, that Paul\u0026rsquo;s thinking about Jesus preceded his thinking about the plight from which people needed rescuing. To be sure, the revelation of the risen Jesus on the road to Damascus gave new shape and direction to his thinking, on this and on everything else; but the pre-Damascus Paul was well aware that there was a \u0026ldquo;problem\u0026rdquo; to be addressed. This was not, perhaps, the problem of an unquiet conscience wished on him by theologians from Augustine to Luther and beyond, but it was, certainly, the problem of the pagan world under the power of evil, and the problem that so much of the Jewish world seemed hell-bent on compromising with paganism. For himself as a zealous Pharisee, there was the very specific problem that, even if he and some others were \u0026ldquo;blameless concerning the law\u0026rdquo; (Phil. 3:6), Israel\u0026rsquo;s God had so far not acted within their history to send the Messiah, to fight the decisive battle against evil, to reveal his \u0026ldquo;righteousness\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; that is, his faithfulness to the covenant promises with Israel, to redeem his people, to judge the wicked world, and to set up the long-awaited kingdom of justice and peace. That was the problem the pre-Christian Paul possessed. His conversion deepened it, pointing at himself the accusing finger that he would formerly have pointed at almost everyone else; but it did not create a problem out of nothing.\nThe solution Paul embraced, which emerges clearly though briefly in Galatians, to be elaborated in different situations in the other letters, can be summed up in two closely related words: \u0026ldquo;Christ\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Spirit.\u0026rdquo; In Jesus the Messiah Israel\u0026rsquo;s God has dealt with sin and established the new world, the \u0026ldquo;age to come,\u0026rdquo; calling the Gentiles to belong to his renewed people. Paul\u0026rsquo;s theology of the cross, which receives repeated emphasis in Galatians, stresses both the solidarity of Jesus with his people and the unique weight of sin and its effects which were borne by Jesus himself. Though, as we saw, Paul never articulates a single \u0026ldquo;theology of atonement,\u0026rdquo; his many rich statements of Jesus' death, in this letter and throughout his works, together form a many-sided doctrine that must be seen as central to his whole thinking.\nOne of the many ways Paul can refer to this whole achievement of Jesus is in terms of Jesus' \u0026ldquo;faithfulness\u0026rdquo; to the covenant; this, I think, is the correct interpretation of the much-controverted pistis Christou problem.[[10]]{.ul} As with so many issues, linguistic study by itself will not solve the problem of whether, when Paul says pistis Christou, he means \u0026ldquo;faith in the Messiah\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the faith(fullness) of the Messiah.\u0026rdquo; Both ideas play a role in his thought. In Galatians 2:16, after all, he does say \u0026ldquo;we believed in the Messiah, Jesus,\u0026rdquo; and in Romans 5:15-19 the \u0026ldquo;obedience\u0026rdquo; of Jesus the Messiah is the key category that sums up all that Paul said about Jesus' death in 3:21-26 (Phil. 2:5-8 confirms that this is the correct interpretation). Romans is, indeed, the key to understanding the concept; in Romans 3:1-8 the problem that faces God, as well as the whole human race, is that Israel has been \u0026ldquo;faithless\u0026rdquo; to the commission to be the light of the world (cf. 2:17-24). How then is God to reveal his own covenant faithfulness? Paul\u0026rsquo;s answer is that God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness is revealed in and through the faithfulness of Jesus the Messiah, the representative Israelite. Confusion arises not only because this is not the train of thought readers of Romans in much church tradition have been expecting \u0026mdash; it is too Jewish by half for that \u0026mdash; but also because Paul also says, sometimes in the same breath, as in Romans 3:22 and Galatians 2:16; 3:22, that the beneficiaries of this covenant faithfulness of the Messiah are precisely those who in their turn \u0026ldquo;believe\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;are faithful.\u0026rdquo;\nBy the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, this God has called and is calling Jews and Gentiles alike to belong to the one family of Abraham, and equipping them to believe the gospel (such faith being the one identifying badge of membership within this family) and to live in love one to another and in witness to God\u0026rsquo;s love to the world around. Like the texts from Qumran, Paul\u0026rsquo;s letters articulate an inaugurated eschatology in which the new age has already begun but is yet to be completed. \u0026ldquo;We by the spirit and by faith wait for the hope of righteousness\u0026rdquo; (5:5). The Spirit is the power of the new age breaking into the present, but future hope remains vital for the complete picture. This, though briefly stated in Galatians, points toward wider statements of the same theology elsewhere in Paul (e.g., 1 Cor. 15) and indeed, though sometimes differently stated, in the rest of the NT. For Paul, of course, as most Christian theology has always insisted, the Spirit is the same Spirit through whom God spoke and acted in the history of Israel; the key difference in the new thing that has come about through Jesus is that the Spirit is now poured out on all God\u0026rsquo;s people, Jew and Gentile alike.\nGod, Jesus, Spirit, plight, and solution: the final question the systematic theologian might want to put to Galatians would be about theology and ethics. Here again the letter restates the question, and answers it in its own way. Earlier readings of Galatians, particularly in the Reformation tradition, had so emphasized the wrongness of \u0026ldquo;justification by works,\u0026rdquo; understanding that phrase in a Pelagian or Arminian sense, as to make it difficult to articulate any sense of moral obligation or moral effort within the Christian. There are signs that Paul faced similar problems (e.g., Rom. 3:7-8; 6:1,15), but this does not seem to be why, in the final two chapters of Galatians, he provides such a lengthy discourse on Christian behavior (the term \u0026ldquo;ethics\u0026rdquo; is itself loaded, belonging already to the too-sharp distinction between theory and practice of which I spoke earlier). Though he undoubtedly wants his converts to avoid what he calls \u0026ldquo;the works of the flesh\u0026rdquo; and to exhibit what he calls \u0026ldquo;the fruit of the Spirit,\u0026rdquo; the actual argument in which those phrases and the things they denote occurs is more subtle than simply exhortation. It has various overtones and echoes of that classic passage on the law, Romans 7, and may, like that passage, be deliberately doing several things at the same time (see, e.g., Gal. 5:17: \u0026ldquo;spirit and flesh fight against each other, so that what you wish you cannot do\u0026rdquo;). It is an argument about the law, and about how, though the law is God\u0026rsquo;s law, it cannot give the thing to which it points, and about how, nevertheless, those who discover that to which it points are in line with what the law intended, even though they may be neither possessors nor, in its boundary-marking sense, keepers of it.\nHe is saying, in effect, \u0026ldquo;If you insist on embracing the Jewish law, and particularly on getting circumcised, you are declaring that you belong in the realm of the \u0026lsquo;flesh\u0026rsquo;; but if you go and live in that realm, you must look at the company you will be keeping, and the sort of life into which you will be drawn.\u0026rdquo; (The only sort of \u0026ldquo;fleshly\u0026rdquo; behavior he thinks the Galatians are actually exhibiting is factional fighting, as 5:15,26 suggests; these angry divisions in their community, he is saying in effect, are a sign that they are in fact living according to the flesh, confirming the analysis he is offering of their desire to get circumcised.) The pagans who live in that fashion are heading for destruction, but those who live and walk by the Spirit, whose first fruit is love, find that although they are not behaving this way in order to conform to the Jewish law, so that they may thereby be defined as ethnically the people of God, they are not condemned by the law. \u0026ldquo;Against such there is no law\u0026rdquo; (5:23). With this we are back once more at 2:17. Just because we have come out from under the rule of the Torah through baptism and faith, through dying and rising with Christ, this does not mean that the Torah (by which Paul presumably means the God who gave the Torah) is displeased with us. That Paul is working with this same train of thought is indicated in 5:24: those who belong to the Messiah have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires (compare 2:19-20; Rom 7:4-6).\n\u0026ldquo;Ethics,\u0026rdquo; then, understood as Paul\u0026rsquo;s arguments about Christian behavior. function within Galatians not as an appendix to \u0026ldquo;theology,\u0026rdquo; nor simply (as in Luther) as a tertius usus legis,[[11]]{.ul} nor as an awkward concession after an antilegalistic \u0026ldquo;justification by faith,\u0026rdquo; but rather as part of the inner working of the gospel itself. Through the gospel events of Jesus' messianic death and resurrection, the God of Israel delivers Israel and the world from the rule of evil and the \u0026ldquo;powers\u0026rdquo; who perpetrate it. Through the Spirit-inspired proclamation of the good news of Jesus as Messiah and Lord, this same God calls into being the redeemed family he had promised to Abraham, whose distinguishing mark, over against those of Judaism, is \u0026ldquo;the faithfulness of Jesus\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; i.e., Jesus' own faithfulness, reflected now in the faith/faithfulness (would Paul have distinguished these two?) of Christians. Precisely because this family is the Christ-and-Spirit people, they are set free from the destructive powers and solidarities (including social solidarities) of evil, and are under the obligation of freedom, namely, to sustain this life by Spirit-given love for one another. That they are free to do so is given in the fact that they have been crucified with the Messiah (5:24; 6:14; 2:20). This is Paul\u0026rsquo;s answer in Galatians to the question of \u0026ldquo;ethics,\u0026rdquo; and it conforms well to his other similar treatments elsewhere.\n3. Galatians, the Church, and the World\nWhat then has Galatians to say to the large debates that concern Christian theologians today, living often at the interface of church and world? Again, we can present some sample questions only, with some tendentious possible answers.\nThe question that hangs over all contemporary intellectual discourse in the Western world concerns the very foundations of all knowing and being. The great project of the last two or three hundred years, sometimes known as \u0026ldquo;modernity,\u0026rdquo; has given way in many quarters to \u0026ldquo;postmodernity.\u0026rdquo; Modernism claimed to know things objectively, at least in principle; postmodernism applies a ruthlessly suspicious understanding to all such claims, showing in case after case that, as Nietzsche argued a century ago, claims to knowledge are in fact claims to power. The correlate of this was that modernism claimed that there was a real world independent of the knower. Postmodernism collapses this claim; all we are left with are the prejudices of the would-be knower.\nLikewise, modernism told a great story of progress, enlightenment, and development, and insisted that this story \u0026mdash; in which, of course, the Western world of the eighteenth century and subsequently was the hero \u0026mdash; be imposed on the rest of the world, in a secular version of the Christian missionary enterprise that was burgeoning at exactly that time. Postmodernity declares that all such large stories \u0026mdash; \u0026ldquo;metanarratives\u0026rdquo; is the word usually employed to denote the stories that stand behind or above the smaller stories people tell and live \u0026mdash; are destructive and enslaving, and must be deconstructed. All we are left with are the various smaller stories by which individual communities order their lives, and even they are constantly under suspicion.\nWhat about the individual himself or herself? Modernity vaunted the great individual, the lonely and lofty \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; the master of my fate, the captain of my soul. Postmodernity has deconstructed this figure, too. Each of us, we are now reminded, is a shifting mass of impulses and feelings, without a stable center that can be held up and inspected. Impressions to the contrary are just so much posturing. These are the main elements of postmodernity, which filter through into popular consciousness in thousands of ways even among those who know nothing of the technical terms of the discussion.\nHow can a Christian theologian, with Galatians open before her or him, address these questions? Galatians is. after all, concerned with truth (2:5. 14; 4:16; 5:7); with claims and counterclaims to knowledge, including knowledge of God (e.g., 4:8-9); with a great story that began with Abraham, climaxed in Jesus the Messiah, and is moving outward to embrace the world (3:6-4:11; etc.). The most fundamental answer, I believe, is that in Galatians Paul is concerned precisely with the breaking of the bonds of slavery and the setting free of captives. He retells the exodus narrative, in 4:1-7 in particular, showing how in Jesus the Messiah and by the Spirit those who were enslaved to nongods have been liberated (4:8; cf. 1:4). The story he tells certainly is a grand overarching narrative, beginning with Israel and reaching out to embrace the world, but it is a story that leaves no human being, organization, or ethnic group in a position of power over others. It is the Jewish story, but it is not the typical Jew who says, \u0026ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me.\u0026rdquo; This is the story precisely of how those who were kept as second-class citizens are now welcomed in on equal terms. This is a metanarrative like no other.\nThe same text (2:19-21) is Paul\u0026rsquo;s answer to those who would see the individual deconstructed into various shifting forces and impulses. Paul goes further. The individual, especially individuals who pride themselves on their status, must die in order to live. And the new life they are given is not their own, is nothing to be proud of, is nothing to give them status over others; it is the life of the crucified and risen Messiah. This is an individuality like no other.\nAnd the result of the gospel is that those who are liberated from slavery have come \u0026ldquo;to know God\u0026rdquo; (4:9) \u0026mdash; or rather, as Paul quickly modifies it, to be known by God (cf. 1 Cor. 8:1-6). Just as the Israelites were granted a fresh revelation of the true God in the exodus, so the events of the new exodus have truly revealed this same God in a new way. But the whole idea of \u0026ldquo;knowledge,\u0026rdquo; and with it of truth itself, is hereby set on a new footing. No longer is it the brittle and arrogant knowledge of the post-Enlightenment world, making the hard sciences its primary paradigm and \u0026ldquo;relationships\u0026rdquo; simply a matter of \u0026ldquo;feeling.\u0026rdquo; Nor is it the soft and fuzzy knowledge of the postmodern world, where \u0026ldquo;feeling\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;impression\u0026rdquo; are all that there is. The primary knowledge, declares Paul, is the knowledge of God \u0026mdash; God\u0026rsquo;s knowledge of you, and yours of God in grateful answer. This is a relationship, one that produces the deepest feelings ever known, but it is true knowledge nonetheless \u0026mdash; both in that it is knowledge of the truth and in that it constitutes the truest mode of knowing. All other knowing is first relativized and then, when and as appropriate, reaffirmed in new ways from that point. This is a knowing like no other, because it is knowledge of a reality like no other.\nThis account is, of course, so brief as to be no more than a signpost. But it makes the point that the issues Paul is addressing in Galatians can provide us with starting points to address the major issues of our own day. The opponents, after all, whoever they were, were seeking to establish a way of being, a grand story, a form of knowing, a type of identity, upon the converts. The pressure to get circumcised was precisely an insistence on establishing one kind of ethnic or para-ethnic identity over against others. Paul deconstructs these claims, showing that they themselves are dehumanizing, based on \u0026ldquo;the flesh.\u0026rdquo; In particular, he shows \u0026mdash; a point that must be reemphasized both in the clash between modernity and postmodernity and in the dawning of a new millennium \u0026mdash; that the single moment by which history was changed forever was the moment when Jesus the Messiah died and rose again. Modernity, postmodernity, and various sorts of millennial speculation all offer their own counter-eschatology, but to take Galatians seriously is to insist that the real turnaround, the real moment of liberation, occurred not with some great cultural shift in the Western world of the last few centuries, but when Jesus of Nazareth rose from the dead, having \u0026ldquo;given himself for our sins\u0026rdquo; (1:4).\nOf course, it is fatally easy for Christians to embrace Paul\u0026rsquo;s gospel as a new way of being in control of the world, a new power game, a new way of establishing one\u0026rsquo;s identity as a matter of pride. To what extent this has happened and does happen in different churches and their claims is a question that cannot be ignored. But the key thing about Paul\u0026rsquo;s gospel is not power, but love: the Son of God \u0026ldquo;loved me and gave himself for me\u0026rdquo; (2:20); \u0026ldquo;faith working through love\u0026rdquo; is the sign of true life (5:6); love is the first fruit of the divine Spirit, a love that leads to mutual service (5:22,13). Paul offers no encouragement to those who want to go back to modernity. He agrees with the postmodern critique of all human pride; but when all is said and done, God is creating in Christ a new world built on love and characterized by love. Postmodernity preaches a stern and judging law against all human pride, but those who walk by the Spirit \u0026ldquo;are not under the law\u0026rdquo; (5:18).\nOne of the great crises in the contemporary world, which brings to a head the sense of uncertainty within the formerly all-too-certain Western world, is the situation of global security on the one hand and long-running tribal or geographical conflict on the other. A century ago many in the West believed that war was a necessary part of human development, leading through conflict at the societal level to the survival of the fittest, on a loose analogy with Darwin\u0026rsquo;s theory of evolution. Two world wars and hundreds of smaller ones later, few believe this anymore; and the \u0026ldquo;Cold War\u0026rdquo; that hung over the world for nearly half a century reflected this growing uncertainty. But the modernist paradigm still remained in place, and when the West effectively won the Cold War, a victory symbolized by the destruction of the Berlin Wall, there was a widespread assumption that this would mean the worldwide triumph of so-called \u0026ldquo;Western\u0026rdquo; values. What has happened, of course, is very different. The Balkans, the Middle East, many African countries, and many other parts of the world are a grim reminder that hatred and violence based on tribe, race, and geography have not disappeared overnight, and remain deep-rooted. The world is full of evidence for Paul\u0026rsquo;s warning: \u0026ldquo;If you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not destroyed by each other\u0026rdquo; (5:15).\nIt will not do simply to say that into this world must be spoken the gospel of Jesus Christ, the gospel Paul articulates and defends in Galatians. This is of course true, but what will it say to the Serb and the Croat, to the Tutsi and the Hutu, to the Palestinian and the Israeli? Will it simply say, If only you would all believe in Jesus, none of this would be necessary? (If it did, it might find further problems: the Serb and the Croat, the Catholic and Protestant in Northern Ireland, all in theory believe in Jesus; and to modify the statement to say \u0026ldquo;if only you would believe in Jesus the same way I do\u0026rdquo; would stand revealed as a new sort of tribalism.) The most powerful statement it can make must be made symbolically, through the coming together in a single worshiping family, eating at the same table, of all those who belong to Jesus the Messiah, despite their apparently irreconcilable racial, tribal, or other tensions. That is the powerful message of Galatians 2:15-21. That is a first step.\nBut second, the gospel as articulated in Galatians points to the hard double-task described brilliantly in a recent book by Miroslav Volf.[[12]]{.ul} Himself a Croatian, reflecting on the conflict in his native land, Volf wrestles mightily with the gospel imperative toward forgiveness, reconciliation, and inclusion, on the one hand, and the absolute need to name and expose evil, and to deal with it, on the other. One cannot have the embrace of reconciliation without also having the exclusion of evil. The older liberal agendas that insisted only on the former, and the tribal agendas that name as \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; all that the other tribe does or seeks to do, must be challenged by a larger vision, a harder agenda. And those who read Galatians must, I suggest, be in the forefront of those presenting this agenda and vision to governments and policy makers, often at a loss as they are to know where to turn for guidance now that the old rules of modernity have let them down. The church must not only symbolize in its own life God\u0026rsquo;s victory over all the powers of evil, the powers that keep peoples locked in their own separate stories, fighting all others. The church must present the world and its rulers with ways of \u0026ldquo;excluding\u0026rdquo; that will lead to \u0026ldquo;embrace\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; just as Paul, confronting Peter and the others at Antioch, and the opponents in Galatia, named as clearly as he could the antigospel forces to which he saw them succumbing, with the aim that all those who named the name of Jesus should be able to share in the one family meal.\nThe particular conflict in our world to which Galatians must be addressed is, of course, that which disfigures to this day the land of Jesus' birth. The story is so complex, presenting analysts with a huge tangled ball of wool to unravel before a coherent solution can even be thought of, that it is presumptuous, almost dangerous, even to raise the question in a context like this.[[13]]{.ul} Yet there are two points on which Galatians would insist, and which could have a profound effect on the way people regard the situation and act, individually and corporately, in relation to it.\nThe first is the insistence, once again, that all Jesus' followers belong together in worship and table fellowship. In the Middle East, at the moment, it is sadly true that most indigenous Christianity seems to be dying out. The old monasteries, many of which have maintained unbroken their traditions of worship for fifteen hundred years or more, are almost empty, and many have been demolished by hostile authorities.[[14]]{.ul} The small Palestinian Christian communities, which trace their roots back to the first century and have lived in the land ever since, find themselves caught between the self-righteous \u0026ldquo;settlers\u0026rdquo; on the one hand \u0026mdash; Paul would, I think, have called them \u0026ldquo;unsettlers\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; and the increasingly strident Islamic militants on the other. Many have simply left, and do not expect to return. The tiny Israeli Christian communities live, theoretically, in daily risk of losing their citizenship for renouncing their Judaism. There are reports of many meeting in secret. But there are few, very few, places where Israeli and Palestinian Christians can meet and worship together and share in trusting fellowship. And the immigrant Christians \u0026mdash; the Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox, with their multiple subdivisions \u0026mdash; are no better, but instead play similar territorial and other battles with one another. How can one even glance at Galatians and shrug one\u0026rsquo;s shoulders at this situation? Jesus is not Lord where churches divide along ethnic, tribal, or geographical lines. That was \u0026ldquo;the truth of the gospel\u0026rdquo; for which Paul contended in the first century, and it remains the truth of the gospel today.\nThe second point is that, despite the extravagant claims of some, there is no biblical warrant whatsoever for the suggestion that the reestablishment of the state of Israel in the 1940s constituted the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and that, as such, it should be supported by right-thinking Christians. Galatians is one of the biblical books that most strongly gives the lie to this. Paul is at pains throughout to distance himself from any geographical or territorial claim; these things are done away with in Christ. \u0026ldquo;The present Jerusalem is in bondage with her children; but the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is the mother of us all\u0026rdquo; (4:25-26). Nor is this a mere assertion. Paul\u0026rsquo;s whole argument is that \u0026ldquo;the Israel of God\u0026rdquo; (6:16) consists of all those, Jew and Gentile alike, who believe in Jesus the Messiah.[[15]]{.ul} \u0026ldquo;If you belong to the Messiah, you are Abraham\u0026rsquo;s seed, heirs according to the promise.\u0026rdquo; How then can the \u0026ldquo;inheritance\u0026rdquo; of the \u0026ldquo;heirs\u0026rdquo; be translated back into terms of a few square miles of sacred land, kept for the descendants of Abraham \u0026ldquo;according to the flesh\u0026rdquo;?[[16]]{.ul}\nThe greatest question, of course, which hangs over all Christian thinking and speaking in our day, and which poses an equal challenge to systematic and practical theology, is: How can we speak truly and appropriately of God within a world that has forgotten most of what it thought it knew about God and has distorted much of the rest? And what weight, what \u0026ldquo;authority,\u0026rdquo; can such speaking command?\nWe may remind ourselves of the problem. Most people rooted in contemporary Western culture assume, unless they have been specifically shaken out of this way of thinking, that the word \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; refers, more or less univocally, to a being who is detached from the world, living at some great ontological remove (most know that Christians and others do not believe in God as a being literally \u0026ldquo;up in the sky,\u0026rdquo; but most assume a similar detachment in some other mode of being). They then tend to assume that when Christians talk about God becoming human in Jesus, about God addressing individuals or the world, or about God active within the world, this must be a matter of God\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;intervening\u0026rdquo; from a distance. They assume, moreover, that all religions are basically trying to be about the same thing; this idea is frequently supposed to be a very recent innovation or discovery, but was of course the common coin of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and indeed has roots much further back in some aspects of classical paganism.\nAnd they assume that this general thing \u0026mdash; which may as well be called \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; for want of a better term, though that word is so over- and ill-used that one wonders if a moratorium would not be a good idea \u0026mdash; has basically failed. It has collapsed, so it is thought by those who think about these things, under the critique of Marx, who said that talking about God was what those in power did to keep the rest quiet; of Darwin, who said that we were all descended from the apes anyway, and that the world could be understood successfully without a creating or sustaining God, since it works on the basis of competition; of Freud, who said that God-language was projection of a latent father image; and of Nietzsche, who despised Christianity for being wet and wimpish while also exposing its truth claims as power games. Of course, as C. S. Lewis used to say, if people really thought about these things, it might become clear that the attacks, though sometimes interesting and important, are not ultimately valid. But most people in western Europe, and many in North America, do not think very hard about such issues. They assume, not least because the media tell them so, that \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; are somehow out of date. Within the postmodern world it is feelings that count, not arguments; and there is a general feeling, widespread in much (though not all) Western culture, that all that sort of thing has had its day \u0026mdash; certainly in any form that the culture has known for the last several hundred years.\nOf course, this is not the only side of the story. New Age movements have brought \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; of a sort back into fashion; and the oldest form of Christianity in Britain at least, that of the Celts, who evangelized much of Britain before the Romans arrived and effectively took over, has had a revival as well. Celtic Christianity was earthier, less authoritarian, more in tune with the created order than the Roman variety, and this has made its appeal powerful. But at a time when hardly anybody thinks about the niceties of theology (they are prepared to think about nuclear physics, about economics, about anything the media bombard them with, but not usually about theology), it is difficult for many to sort out the difference between the God-language of the New Age movement and the God-language of mainstream Christianity.\nThe God of whom Paul speaks in Galatians, of whom I have already written at the start of the previous section, is not a private God, to be worshiped by initiates but kept secret from the outside world. This God must be spoken of in the public arena. This God claims the allegiance of all, because this God is both creator and lover of all. This God is the reality of which the idols of the world are the parodies (4:8-11). But how can one speak of this God without being instantly misunderstood? If one uses the word \u0026ldquo;God,\u0026rdquo; people will suppose one is speaking of the detached, deist God of popular supposition. If one even pronounces the name and title \u0026ldquo;Jesus Christ,\u0026rdquo; one will at once send half one\u0026rsquo;s hearers off down the wrong street. Among those to whom the phrase is not simply a meaningless swearword, many will simply hear it as another signal of that \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; which is assumed to be out of date and irrelevant.\nPaul, we know from Acts, faced similar problems, and he got around them by telling the story of Jesus, perhaps with visual aids to show what he was talking about (\u0026ldquo;You before whose eyes Jesus the Messiah was publicly portrayed as crucified\u0026rdquo; [3:1]; did Paul draw one of the first-ever \u0026ldquo;crucifixes\u0026rdquo; as an aid to evangelism?).[[17]]{.ul} The story itself, climaxing with Jesus' death and resurrection, and his enthronement as Lord of the world, carries its own power (Rom. 1:17; 1 Cor. 1:18-2:5). The story must be told faithfully, accurately, and Jewishly (it only makes the sense it does in its Jewish context).[[18]]{.ul} However, even this needs a hearing. Paul seems to have obtained his not least because of his original appearance in Galatia, which aroused their sympathy and showed them that he was already living by a different way when compared to other teachers and wandering philosophers they might have met.[[19]]{.ul} Paul was embodying the message he was announcing. The story of Jesus was being recapitulated through his own actual life \u0026mdash; which was why, Paul would quickly have said, the power of the Spirit of Jesus was at work when he told them of the Jewish Messiah, the Lord of the world. If there is a lesson for Christians today in all this, it is the one that is both obvious and also still sorely needed. Those who name the name of Jesus must be seen to be living the life that results from worshiping the true God. Their own genuine humanity, resulting from worshiping the God in whose image they are made, must be recognizable. The fruits of the Spirit, when we meet them, are impressive, particularly in our cynical age. If we are to get a hearing to tell the story of Jesus, this is the only way to start.\nBut there is more. The church must be active at the places where the world is in pain. The church must be in the forefront of work in the world to alleviate hunger and poverty, to remit major and unpayable international debt, to make peace and prevent war. The church must be on the front line in the fight against crime and the fight for proper punishment and rehabilitation of those convicted of crime, as well as for the rights of the victims of crime. Christians must be active not only in advocacy of the moral standards in which all are treated as full human beings, not as toys or as trash, but also to stand alongside and help those who, having been treated like that themselves, treat others the same way because that is the only way they know. In these and many, many other ways, those who would tell the story of Jesus must first live it, bearing a measure of the world\u0026rsquo;s pain as they do so.\nIn the process, though the words of the story remain important and ultimately nonnegotiable, the actions themselves will speak. They will provide, as it were, the grammar book and the dictionary that will enable people to understand that when we speak of God today we are not using the word in the normally accepted sense; that when we speak of Jesus we speak of a real human being in whom the living God was and is personally present, in whom the love of God was fully acted out. If the story is told with those lexical aids to back it up, it will be understood. People may not like it, but the message will be plain. And to those who respond, the challenge will come to continue with this God: \u0026ldquo;Then, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods. But now that you know God, or rather have come to be known by God, how can you turn back?\u0026rdquo; (4:8-9).\n4. Galatians: Exegesis and Theology\nWe have now arrived back at the point where the detailed historical exegesis of Galatians and the wider theological reflections may, in some measure and very briefly, be joined together. My overall contention, as will by now be obvious, is that they belong closely with each other, need each other, and are mutually illuminating. It will take an entire commentary to demonstrate this point, but four major features may at least be outlined in conclusion.\nFirst let me raise a point of method. Galatians offers itself to the reader as a text emerging from, referring constantly to, and intending to have serious effect upon a highly complex and many-sided social situation. At no point can we abstract Paul\u0026rsquo;s ideas from this setting; and this, within an incarnational religion such as Christianity, has almost always been and is undoubtedly a strength, not a weakness. To suppose that one must boil off doctrinal abstractions from the particularities of the letters in order to gain material that can be usable in different situations is at best a half-truth; it always runs the risk of implying that the \u0026ldquo;ideas\u0026rdquo; are the reality, and that the community in which they are embodied and embedded (Paul\u0026rsquo;s community on the one hand, ours on the other) is a secondary matter. Those who, like the present writer, work as theologians within actual ecclesial communities for which they have pastoral, organizational, and teaching responsibilities know otherwise. It is in taking seriously Paul\u0026rsquo;s struggles with authority, with other apostles, with agitators in a congregation, with division and reconciliation within a community, that we discover what the \u0026ldquo;doctrines\u0026rdquo; he seems to hold actually mean. This in no way reduces theology to sociology. Nor does it suggest that theological argument is shadowboxing, pretending to reason something out when what is going on is in fact disguised power play. It is a way of doing justice to Paul\u0026rsquo;s intention not least, but not only, in the first two chapters of Galatians: to enable his readers to understand what the gospel is, what his own relation to it is, and where they, his converts, belong on this map.\nThis intention, second, is expressed in Paul\u0026rsquo;s major concern throughout the letter but particularly in its central two chapters, 3 and 4. Here he tells the story of Israel, the people of God, as the story of Abraham and exodus. God made promises to Abraham, promises that (as in Gen. 15, to which, here and in Rom. 4, Paul refers repeatedly) envisaged God\u0026rsquo;s future rescue of his people from Egypt. God has now fulfilled those promises, Paul says, in Jesus Christ. His aim throughout is to persuade his hearers to understand themselves within this narrative structure, which I have elsewhere characterized as \u0026ldquo;covenantal.\u0026rdquo; He wants them, that is, to think of themselves as the children of Abraham, the heirs of the entire Jewish narrative.[[20]]{.ul} A good example is 1 Corinthians 10:1-13, written of course to an ex-pagan congregation; the foundation of the argument is Paul\u0026rsquo;s reference to the wilderness generation as \u0026ldquo;our fathers.\u0026rdquo;\nHis deep-rooted negation of the Jewish Torah as the mode or badge of membership in this family is, of course, the central problem he faces, and hence the central problem of the letter; this rejection of the Mosaic covenant has influenced many contemporary writers to deny that Paul held any \u0026ldquo;covenantal\u0026rdquo; theology at all.[[21]]{.ul} This, I am persuaded, is a radical mistake. Paul utterly discarded the ethnic and Torah-based shape of Judaism in which he had been so deeply involved before his conversion, and to this extent his theology is radical, apocalyptic, innovative, dialectic, and so forth. But all this is held within his conviction that the God whom he now knows in Jesus Christ and the Spirit is the God of Abraham, whose purposes have now taken a decisive turn in which the character of the community as defined by Torah is left behind (not, it should be noted, criticized as theologically repugnant). He tells the story of Abraham, Israel, Moses, Jesus, and himself\u0026mdash;Paul himself becomes a character in the narrative, since he is the unique apostle to the Gentiles, a point that is foundational for Galatians\u0026mdash;in order to help his readers understand where they in turn belong within the same narrative.\nBecause the letter indicates this as a very basic aim of Paul all through, I am persuaded that he has not simply introduced Abraham, and allusions to other biblical passages and stories, in order to meet points raised by his opponents. Indeed, even if his opponents had never mentioned Abraham, perhaps especially if they had not, Paul would have wanted to tell this story to address and controvert the point the agitators were urging, that Gentiles who wanted to join the people of Israel had to be circumcised. His way of telling the story of Abraham makes it abundantly clear that the promises God made to the patriarch cannot be fulfilled through Torah. According to Galatians 3:10-14, God promised Abraham a worldwide family, but the Torah presents Israel, the promise bearers, with a curse. God deals with the curse in the death of Jesus, so that the promise may flow through to the world, renewing the covenant with Israel as well. According to 3:15-22, God promised Abraham a single worldwide family, but the Torah would forever keep Jews and Gentiles in separate compartments (exactly the problem of 2:11-21 and, we may assume, of the Galatian congregations). God has done in Christ and by the Spirit what the Torah could not do (3:21-22; 4:1-7; cf. Rom. 8:3-4), so that there now exists the single promised multiethnic monotheistic family, God\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;sons\u0026rdquo; and heirs.[[22]]{.ul} According to Galatians 4:21-31, insofar as Abraham has two families, they can be characterized as the slave family and the free; and it is the multiethnic people defined by faith, the people formed through Christ and the Spirit, who are the Isaac children, the free people of God. Paul has other ways of telling the story of Abraham and his family as well (e.g., Rom. 9:6-10:4), but it is this narrative, however articulated, that provides the theological grounding for the formation and maintenance of the community he believes himself called to address.\nThird, we can now see that the regular theological dichotomies that have been used in debates about Paul for the last hundred years are in fact inadequate to the task. Schweitzer and Wrede insisted on \u0026ldquo;being in Christ\u0026rdquo; as a more central category than \u0026ldquo;justification by faith.\u0026rdquo; Sanders, similarly, prioritized \u0026ldquo;participationist\u0026rdquo; categories in Paul over \u0026ldquo;juristic\u0026rdquo; ones. More recently, Martyn and others have urged \u0026ldquo;apocalyptic\u0026rdquo; readings of Paul against \u0026ldquo;covenantal\u0026rdquo; ones. Granted that these broad-brush categories are imprecise, there is clearly a strong feeling among Western readers of Paul that one is faced again and again with different kinds of emphases, which may not always be strictly compatible. This works out in Romans, for instance, in terms of the playing off of one of its clear sections (chaps. 1-4, 5-8, 9-11, 12-16) against the others.\nI believe, and I hope that detailed exegesis will support this hypothesis, that in each case these dichotomies have failed to grasp the more fundamental structures of Paul\u0026rsquo;s socially contextualized and literarily structured theological thought. Once we grasp the covenantal narrative that Paul sets out in Galatians as the world he invites his readers to inhabit, we discover that these elements \u0026mdash; which appear disparate when seen from a post-Reformation, post-Enlightenment, or postromantic viewpoint \u0026mdash; belong together within the much richer tapestry he is weaving. The story of the new exodus in Christ, and the homeward journey of God\u0026rsquo;s people led by the Spirit, provides the setting for incorporative and participationist language to have its full meaning and weight simultaneously with the juristic meaning of justification. Because of sin, and the distortion of Torah by the people to whom it was given, the fulfillment of the covenant cannot but come about as an apocalyptic event, declaring God\u0026rsquo;s judgment on what has gone before and God\u0026rsquo;s new creation of what is now beginning. But when the dust settles and God\u0026rsquo;s renewed people look around them, they discover that this apocalyptic event is indeed the fulfillment of God\u0026rsquo;s promises to Abraham. This is how God is faithful to the covenant. It will take all of the letter to the Romans to set this out in full detail and most of the rest of the NT to explore the point from a variety of other angles, but the major components of the argument are already complete in Galatians.\nWhat, fourthly and finally, about justification by faith? This is the subject that most expositors of Galatians have found to be central to the argument of the letter itself. But what is it actually about? There is no space here for a full exposition of the doctrine. Rather, I wish to pose the question thus: What particular emphases does Galatians, read historically and exegetically, provide in this central matter?\nThe first point we have already noted. Paul\u0026rsquo;s initial introduction of the topic is embedded within, and seems to be the sharp edge of, the question that was at issue between himself and Peter in Antioch and, we may assume, bears some close relation to the dispute between himself and the \u0026ldquo;agitators\u0026rdquo; in Galatia. This was not the general, abstract theological issue of, shall we say, how to go to heaven when one dies. It was not part of a theory of soteriology, understood in this way. It was the question of whether Christian Jews ought or ought not eat with Christian Gentiles. In other words, it addressed the question of the identity and demarcation of the people of God, now redefined in Jesus Christ \u0026mdash; a question that is both sociological, in the sense that it has to do with a community and its behavior, which can itself be understood by the proper application of sociological methods, and theological, in the sense that this community believes itself to be the people of a God who has drawn up quite clear conditions precisely for its communal life.\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s answer to the question is complex and dense, but its heart is simple. Because he, and all Jewish Christians, have \u0026ldquo;died to the law\u0026rdquo; through sharing the messianic death of Jesus, their identity now is not defined by or in terms of the Jewish law, but rather in terms of the risen life of the Messiah. The boundary marker of this messianic community is therefore not the set of observances that mark out Jews from Gentiles, but rather Jesus the Messiah, the faithful one, himself; and the way in which one is known as a member of this messianic community is thus neither more nor less than (Christian) faith.\nAlthough this account (Gal. 2:15-21) is not itself about soteriology per se, it carries, of course, huge soteriological implications. If one has already died and risen with the Messiah, and if one has been grasped by the grace of God and enabled to come to faith and (by implication, brought into daylight in) baptism (3:26-28), then one is marked out thereby precisely as a member of the renewed, eschatological community of Israel, one for whom the act of God in the Messiah has dealt finally with one\u0026rsquo;s sinful past, one who is assured of God\u0026rsquo;s salvation on the Last Day. But the point of justification by faith, in this context, is not to stress this soteriological aspect, but to insist that all those who share this Christian faith are members of the same single family of God in Christ and therefore belong at the same table. This is the definite, positive, and of course deeply polemical thrust of the first-ever exposition of the Christian doctrine of justification by faith.\nI have already provided a summary account of Galatians 3 and 4, seen as a narrative, or part of a larger implicit narrative, about the promises of God to Abraham and the way in which these are fulfilled in Jesus the Messiah. It remains here simply to note the way in which justification emerges within this structure of thought, which itself is grounded in Paul\u0026rsquo;s sense of the community he is addressing.\nHis emphasis throughout is that the true people whom God promised to Abraham are defined by their faith. He is not here concerned with how one enters the family, but with how, once one has entered, the family is then defined, assured of its status as God\u0026rsquo;s people. The arguments in chapter 3 about the curse of the law, and how it is exhausted in the death of Jesus, and about the apparent tension between the promise and the law, are not primarily abstract statements about the atonement on the one hand and about the existential or spiritual superiority or preferability of trusting promises rather than keeping moral codes on the other. No doubt they contribute to discussions at these more abstract levels, but such matters were not what Paul was basically talking about. And in the great climactic passage at the end of chapter 3 and the start of chapter 4, the question of justification is set within the narrative about slavery and sonship \u0026mdash; that is, the exodus story, in which the key interlocking categories for the present status of Christians are incorporation into Christ and the indwelling of the Spirit. These are not \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; something other than justification. Rather, justification by faith itself, in the letter to Galatia, is all about the definition of the community of the people of the true God.\nThis is, of course, a puzzling conclusion for those who have learned the word \u0026ldquo;justification\u0026rdquo; as a technical term for the way in which someone becomes a Christian. But it is noticeable that when Paul discusses that question (e.g., 1 Thess. 1), he does not use the language of justification. He talks about the way in which, through the gospel proclamation of the crucified and risen Jesus as Messiah and Lord of the world, God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit is at work to bring people to faith, a faith specifically in the God now known in this Jesus. This process, though, is not what Paul means by \u0026ldquo;justification.\u0026quot; Justification, to offer a fuller statement, is the recognition and declaration by God that those who are thus called and believing are in fact his people, the single family promised to Abraham, that as the new covenant people their sins are forgiven, and that since they have already died and been raised with the Messiah they are assured of final bodily resurrection at the last. This, of course, is the argument of (among other passages) Romans 5-8, and in a measure also Philippians 3. In Galatians it is hinted at but never spelled out, for the good reason that Paul\u0026rsquo;s eye is on one thing principally \u0026mdash; namely, the unity of the single Jew-plus-Gentile family in Christ and the consequent impossibility of that family being in anyway defined by the Jewish Torah.\nFully to grasp this, I realize only too well, will demand of those who wish to be in tune with Paul, on the one hand, and to continue to preach the gospel and thereby to evoke and sustain Christian faith, on the other, that they think through afresh the language they use, the passages upon which they draw to make their point, and the detailed theology they are presupposing. But I am quite convinced that this essentially \u0026ldquo;new-look\u0026rdquo; reading of justification in Galatians does not undermine the traditional theology and spirituality that former generations, and other ways of reading Paul, have for so long built upon this text. Indeed, when the bricks of the house are taken down, cleaned, and reassembled in the right order, there is every hope that the building will be more serviceable and weather-proof than before.\nThere are of course many other issues that cry out to be discussed. I have said very little, for example, about the Spirit in Galatians, and the relation of what Paul says on this topic to other NT evidence. But I hope to have shown that the task of bringing together exegesis and theology is valid and fruitful, if demanding, and that a commentary series that attempts such a task has every chance of providing fresh stimulation and insight to a new generation for whom neither dry historical exegesis nor flights of theological fancy will do by themselves. Galatians is a wonderful example of a text that needs history and theology to be working at full stretch and in full harmony. But there is every reason to suppose that the rest of the NT will respond excellently to the same treatment.\n[[1]]{.ul} Cf. the remarks of Karl Barth in the preface to the second edition of his famous commentary on Romans (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1933), pp. 2-15.\n[[2]]{.ul} Ernst Kasemann, Commentary on Romans (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans; London: SCM, 1980), p. viii.\n[[3]]{.ul} Hans-Dieter Betz, Galatians: A Commentary on Paul\u0026rsquo;s Letter to the Churches in Galatia, Hermeneia (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1979).\n[[4]]{.ul} On this see now Ben Witherington III, Grace in Galatia: A Commentary on St. Paul\u0026rsquo;s Letter to the Galatians (Edinburgh: T. \u0026amp; T.

Let\u0026rsquo;s try asking a few questions about our common church practices and see what emerges. Let us imagine the process for a person coming to faith and becoming part of the church\u0026hellip;\nPresenting the Gospel Our Tradition We have been taught to share the Gospel of Christ by explaining how sin has separated us from God and how Jesus paid our penalty by His death on the cross. We need to confess our sins and ask for forgiveness.\nThe astonishing fact is that more than 90% of people who \u0026ldquo;respond\u0026rdquo; to this version of the gospel do not go on to become disciples of Jesus.\nJesus' Command Gospel of the Kingdom, not the Gospel of Christ\n He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform healing. Luke 9:2\n The Gospel of the Kingdom has mostly been replaced in our evangelism and preaching with the Gospel of Christ. In other words, instead of talking about the good news concerning the Kingdom of God, we talk about the good news of Jesus dying for our sins on the cross. Yet even after the cross, the apostles continued to preach the Gospel of the Kingdom and the truth about Christ - even to the Gentiles, who did not have any expectation or understanding of the Jewish concept of God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom:\n \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rsquo;s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!\u0026rdquo; For two whole years Paul stayed there ... He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ! Act 28:28\n The starting-point for the Gospel Jesus instructed that the preaching of the Gospel should start with healing. The apostles and Paul continued to make healing the starting-point for presenting the Gospel.\nWhen Jesus instructed the 70 how to share the Gospel he said, \u0026ldquo;Heal the sick who are there and tell them, \u0026lsquo;The kingdom of God is near you.'\u0026rdquo; Luke 10:9\nWhen describing His own ministry He said, \u0026ldquo;I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.\u0026rdquo; Luke 13:32\nWhen Peter describes Jesus\u0026rsquo; ministry he says \u0026ldquo;God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.\u0026rdquo; Ac 10:38\nWhen Paul described his ministry he said, \u0026ldquo;My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit\u0026rsquo;s power, so that your faith might not rest on men\u0026rsquo;s wisdom, but on God\u0026rsquo;s power.\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.\u0026rdquo; 1Co 2:4-5, 1Co 4:20\nThe Message\nHaving demonstrated God\u0026rsquo;s presence and power with healing and deliverance from demons, the message preached was also about deliverance \u0026ndash; deliverance from the kingdom of darkness into God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom of Light. That is why it was called the Gospel of the Kingdom.\nWhen Jesus announced His mission He said \u0026ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour.\u0026rdquo; Lk 4:18-19\nThe Gospel of the Kingdom is good news to the poor and oppressed. It does not require explanation as to why it is good news. But the self-righteous and self-sufficient will not realise their need. Yet many who are outwardly prosperous are oppressed by inner torment. The Gospel of the Kingdom is not about going to heaven when we die, but being set free to live in God\u0026rsquo;s good Kingdom now. It is a gospel of entering into God\u0026rsquo;s Goodness now.\nRepentance\n \u0026ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.\u0026rdquo; Mark 1:15\n The repentance called for in the Gospel of the Kingdom is focused on turning from the kingdom of Darkness to the Kingdom of Light. It is repentance from our rebellion and independence from God. It is about the whole direction and focus of our lives. It is not really about the individual sins that we might be able to recount \u0026ndash; such a focus encourages a focus on our past and future performance, rather than the underlying motivations in our lives.\nWe never read of Jesus asking anyone to confess and repent of their sins; He simply announces forgiveness as part of the Kingdom message.\nDemonstration, not just explanation\nThe clear emphasis of the Gospel Jesus has commanded us to preach is one of delivering people from the power of Satan and healing them. The Gospel Jesus commanded us to preach is not an explanation but a demonstration of the God who sets us free. Fear and powerlessness has driven us to abandon the demonstration and rely upon explanation. The rise of individualism has led us to abandon the Gospel of the Kingdom and adopt an emasculated individualistic gospel.\nThe response to the gospel Our Tradition We have been taught that the proper response to hearing the gospel is to pray the sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer: asking for God\u0026rsquo;s forgiveness and inviting Him into their life as Lord and Saviour. We have been taught that when a person prays this prayer, they are born again and belong to God.\nJesus' Command Jesus taught that the proper response to the Gospel is immediate baptism.\nWhen Nicodemus asked how he could be saved, Jesus replied, \u0026ldquo;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy Spirit).\u0026rdquo; John 3:5\nPeter taught the same: \u0026ldquo;Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\u0026rdquo; Acts 2:38\n Those who accepted his message were baptized, Acts 2:41\n After Philip had told him the good news about Jesus, the Ethiopian eunuch said, \u0026ldquo;Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?\u0026rdquo; Acts 8:35-36\nAnanias said to Paul on his conversion, \u0026ldquo;And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.\u0026rdquo; Acts 22:16\nThe Philippian gaoler asked, \u0026ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\u0026rdquo; The response was \u0026ldquo;immediately he and all his household were baptized.\u0026rdquo; Acts 16:29-33.\nIf a person who wants to become a Christian does not say \u0026ldquo;I want to be baptised\u0026rdquo; then we have not shared the Gospel as Jesus commanded.\nBaptism Our Tradition We have been taught that salvation is by faith alone, and not by any act or merit on our part. We have been taught that baptism is a symbol of sharing in Jesus' death on the cross and rising again with Him in His resurrection. We have been taught that baptism must be undertaken seriously and after proper instruction, so that a person properly understands what they are doing. We have been taught that Baptism is a public declaration of our commitment to follow Jesus.\nJesus' Command Although salvation is occasionally described without mention of baptism, the overwhelming evidence of the NT is that baptism was considered to be an integral and necessary act in a person\u0026rsquo;s salvation. To separate baptism from salvation is something that the Bible does not permit us to do. No one who wishes to be obedient to Jesus can excuse themselves from baptism.\nSince the NT presents baptism as the means of entering the Kingdom of God, it is never separated from conversion, as a separate event. The notion that someone can be saved, and then instructed in preparation for baptism, is totally absent. If preparation classes are deemed necessary, they should be re-classified as salvation classes, not baptism classes.\nNowhere does the NT teach that baptism should be a public event. On the contrary, both the Philippian gaoler\u0026rsquo;s family and the Ethiopian eunuch had private baptisms.\nNeither Jesus nor any New Testament writer ever says that baptism is a symbol. It is always presented as the means by which a person enters the Kingdom of God. The death of Jesus on the cross and His resurrection from the dead is what Jesus did so that we could be saved, but what we must do is be baptised in water and the Holy Spirit.\n \u0026ldquo;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy Spirit).\u0026rdquo; John 3:5\nWhoever believes and is baptized will be saved. Mark 16:16\n Yes, salvation is by faith alone, but faith is expressed by obedience, and Jesus commanded baptism in water and the Holy Spirit.\nSpeaking about the waters of the Flood, Peter says, \u0026ldquo;this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also\u0026mdash;not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ\u0026rdquo; 1 Peter 3:21\nPeter doesn\u0026rsquo;t say that baptism symbolises our death and resurrection with Jesus, but that the flood symbolises baptism. Baptism is the real thing, and Peter twice says that \u0026ldquo;baptism saves you\u0026rdquo;.\nThrough baptism we are forgiven for our sins and set free from the control of our old nature:\n \u0026ldquo;Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.\u0026rdquo; Acts 2:38\nYour whole self, ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. Col 2:11-12\n Through baptism we die and rise again to become God\u0026rsquo;s children, clothed with Christ:\n We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. Rom 6:4\n In Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. Gal 3:26-27 If we profess faith in Christ and a desire to trust and obey Him, how can we possibly say that we do not need to repent and be baptised for the forgiveness of our sins? It is what the bible teaches.\nBaptism in the Holy Spirit Our Tradition We have been taught that everyone who repents of their sins and asks Jesus into their lives is born-again and automatically receives the Holy Spirit. Some who are hungry for more of God may later be baptised in the Holy Spirit and receive various Spiritual gifts, such as speaking in tongues.\nJesus' Command Jesus said that without the HS we are orphans \u0026ndash; starved of love and unable to relate properly to our Father.\nThe Holy Spirit is not an optional-extra:\n \u0026ldquo;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy Spirit).\u0026rdquo; John 3:5\n\u0026ldquo;Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit\u0026hellip; You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you\u0026rdquo; Acts 1:5,8\n\u0026ldquo;He saved us through the washing of rebirth (baptism in water) and renewal by the Holy Spirit.\u0026rdquo; Titus 3:5\n There is no assurance of salvation apart from the Holy Spirit:\n \u0026ldquo;Having believed, you were marked in Him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, Who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance\u0026rdquo; Ephesians 1:13-14\n\u0026ldquo;We know that we live in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.\u0026rdquo; 1 John 4:13\n Although the Spirit is promised, He is not given automatically when we believe in Jesus or are baptised. Jesus taught that we must ask the Father to give us the Spirit:\n\u0026ldquo;So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. \u0026hellip; If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\u0026rdquo; Luke 11:9-13\nSometimes, such as for Cornelius (Acts 10:44) God baptises believers in the Holy Spirit without them praying, but it is much more usual for prayer to be required, even for baptised believers:\nWhen they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.\u0026rdquo; Acts 8:12-17\n On hearing this, they were baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus. When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. Acts 19:2-6\n Nowhere do we see any other understanding of receiving the Holy Spirit in the New Testament, other than the baptism of the Holy Spirit which was usually manifested by the recipients' speaking in tongues. On what authority can we teach baptism in the Holy Spirit as an optional extra?\nRepentance and Righteousness Our Tradition We have been taught that in order to be forgiven we need to confess our sins, and that we need to keep doing this as often as we are aware of having sinned. We are taught that we are sinners, saved by grace and will constantly fail in our struggle against temptation.\nJesus' Command  Repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations (Luke 24:47)\nRepent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out (Acts 3:19)\n\u0026ldquo;God has granted repentance that leads to life.\u0026rdquo; (Acts 11:18)\n Jesus and the Apostles always associated both repentance and forgiveness with conversion. Repentance was required for faith \u0026ndash; it is a change of view about Christ and God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom, not repentance from wrongdoing. Likewise, forgiveness is eternal saving forgiveness, not short-term conscience-cleansing forgiveness.\n \u0026ldquo;Everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins\u0026rdquo; (Acts 10:43)\n Confession of our sinful acts is never mentioned in connection with salvation. Teaching about confession is often based upon a misunderstanding of:\n \u0026ldquo;If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\u0026rdquo; (1John 1:8-9)\n In this opening passage of his letter John is talking about the Gospel he has proclaimed to them; the gospel through which they were saved; the Gospel that demands repentance from the kingdom of darkness to the Kingdom of light (v5-7). Those who deny their need for repentance are deceived, but those who confess their previous deception are made righteous (v8-10). That this is about salvation rather than our daily lives as believers is shown in the verses that follow:\n \u0026ldquo;If anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father\u0026mdash;Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins.\u0026rdquo;\n As believers we live in the wonder of continuing forgiveness because Jesus' death was sufficient for us. We are now to live in the joy of knowing that Jesus is our righteousness:\n For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. (Gal 3:27)\n We are not supposed to live with a continuing reminder of our sin:\n \u0026ldquo;Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\u0026rdquo; (Rom 5:1)\nFor by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.\u0026rdquo; (Heb 10:14,17)\n The problem with seeing repentance as a daily requirement for dealing with sinful acts is that it takes our attention away from the major repentance issue of the focus and direction of our lives and feeds unbelief and self-righteousness concerning the effectiveness of the Cross in dealing with our sin once and for all time.\nJoining a Church Perhaps the hardest aspect of tradition for us to recognise is regarding our concept of church. We readily see that there are a variety of traditions in the various denominations, but really they are all small variations on a very dominant theme \u0026ndash; maintaining an institution of instruction and control.\nOne of the biggest disconnects between the New Testament and church as we know it must surely be the contrast between the modest attention to church administration in the New Testament and the massive amount of effort and resources that we pour into maintaining our church traditions.\nThe New Testament teaching about \u0026ldquo;church\u0026rdquo; (literally assemblies) is:\n  Disciples of Jesus should assemble together to encourage one another\n and stir one another to love and good works (Heb 10:24).\n   Everyone should take part in this encouragement (1 Cor 14:26,\n 1Thess5:11).\n   Assemblies should rejoice in song and thanksgiving together (Eph\n 5:18-21).\n   They should share a meal of remembrance together (1 Cor 11:23\u0026ndash;26)\n  Jesus has given us all different gifts to serve the body of Christ\n (Rom 12:4-8, Eph 4:11-13, 1 Cor 12:7-11)\n   Assemblies in a town should have elders to oversee and correct any\n false teaching that may arise (Titus 1:5-9).\n   Elders are to lead by example and not through control (1 Pet 5:3)\n  Members are expected to submit to one another and to their overseers\n (elders) (Eph 5:21, Heb 13:17).\n   Assemblies should maintain holiness amongst the members (1 Cor\n 5:12-13).\n   This is a small and simple set of instructions for assemblies of disciples which were generally small enough to meet in people\u0026rsquo;s homes and function like extended families.\nOur Tradition In most cases, Church has been transformed from a family into an institution. The consequences of this are:\n  A new believer is expected to be committed to attending Sunday\n worship every week and to attend the week-day bible study and prayer meetings.\n   A new believer is likely to be encouraged to get involved in some\n aspect of maintaining the church programs, perhaps helping set things up before a service or welcoming people when they arrive.\n   A new believer will be encouraged to give financially for the\n maintenance of the church programs.\n   A new believer is likely to see conforming to the culture of the\n church as more important than conforming to Christ.\n   Jesus' Command Jesus spoke at length about what is required for a Christian to be fruitful. Jesus didn\u0026rsquo;t say to join a church, He said to join Him:\n \u0026ldquo;Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.\u0026rdquo; John 15:4-5\n Jesus pointed to answered prayer, not progress up a church hierarchy, as the measure of fruitful discipleship:\n \u0026ldquo;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. This is to my Father\u0026rsquo;s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples \u0026hellip; You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit\u0026mdash;fruit that will last\u0026mdash;and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you.\u0026rdquo; John 15:7-8, 16\n Jesus did not command that we conform to church culture, but that we love one another:\n \u0026ldquo;If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father\u0026rsquo;s commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.\u0026rdquo; John 15:10-12\n   If the primary experience within a \u0026lsquo;church\u0026rsquo; is not answered prayer\n and love for one another, then we have departed from God\u0026rsquo;s pattern for church.\n   If the assembling together does not consist of each one sharing and\n encouraging the other, then we have departed from God\u0026rsquo;s pattern for church.\n   If the assembling together does not include sharing a meal in which\n we celebrate the New Covenant, then we have departed from God\u0026rsquo;s pattern for church.\n   The Truth that Sets us Free Our Tradition We have been taught that correct doctrine is of utmost importance; that personal and corporate bible study is how we grow as disciples; that truth is correct understanding, that knowledge is freedom.\nJesus' Command  Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free \u0026hellip; Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin \u0026hellip; if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.\u0026rdquo; John 8:31-33\n Sin is really just another word for idolatry. All sin consists of thinking that something other than God\u0026rsquo;s perfect will is more desirable. It is a deceit, because the real truth is that there is never anything more perfect, more truly satisfying, more comforting, more fulfilling, more affirming, more exciting, more anything than God\u0026rsquo;s perfect will for us. So if we sin, it is because we wrongly see something other than God as better than God. Our \u0026ldquo;eyes\u0026rdquo; are wrong, and because of that we are deceived and obey that idol - we are slaves to sin.\nSo the truth that sets us free is not correct doctrine, but Jesus Himself. I am not led into sin by mistaken or faulty understanding of the atonement or by misunderstanding a parable or not being able to expound the letter to the Romans. What I need is a new heart and new eyes to see and love Jesus. I need to \u0026ldquo;abide\u0026rdquo; in Jesus and let His word abide in me. The truth that sets us free is not doctrinal, it is incarnational \u0026ndash; Jesus living in me. This happens through baptism in water and baptism in the Holy Spirit followed by feeding on the word of Jesus under the tutorship of the Holy Spirit.\nPeace and Unity Our Tradition We are taught to maintain the unity and peace of the local church by being kind and gentle and tolerant and understanding. Cultures vary widely in the degree to which people are expected to say what a person wants to hear, rather than to speak the truth, but we often feel that the \u0026ldquo;loving\u0026rdquo; thing to do is to say something other than the truth. We try not to do and say things that might upset others.\nJesus' Command Jesus commands us to love one another as he loves us. These are some of the ways Jesus loved people:\n \u0026ldquo;Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline.\u0026rdquo; Rev 3:19\nJesus turned and said to Peter, \u0026ldquo;Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.\u0026rdquo; Matt 16:23\n\u0026ldquo;You unbelieving and perverse generation,\u0026rdquo; Jesus replied, \u0026ldquo;how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you?\u0026rdquo; Matt 17:17\nBut He turned and rebuked them and said, \u0026ldquo;You do not know what manner of spirit you are of.\u0026rdquo; Lk 9:55\nLater Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen. Mark 16:14\n\u0026ldquo;Martha, Martha,\u0026rdquo; the Lord answered, \u0026ldquo;you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed\u0026mdash;or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.\u0026rdquo; Lk 10:41-42\n Jesus would not have lasted long in most of our churches. He was far too outspoken and divisive. But when He rebuked Peter He got to the heart of the problem: \u0026ldquo;you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns\u0026rdquo;.\nWe are called to live with Kingdom Culture, not man-made culture. When deciding what to do and say we should have the concerns of God in mind and not the fear of man. We are called to love one another as Christ loves us \u0026ndash; that implies that we need to learn from Jesus what love truly looks like. In Jesus, love is never divorced from truth.\nDiscipleship Our Tradition We have understood the Great Commission as \u0026ldquo;go and make disciples of all nations, teaching them everything I have commanded you.\u0026rdquo;\nWe equate faith with doctrine. As a result of this error:\n  Believing and understanding \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; doctrine is our measure of\n maturity.\n   We equate disciple making with teaching.\n  Preaching and bible study are our primary, and often sole means of\n discipleship.\n   We discuss and teach and listen till the cows come home\u0026hellip;\n  Keen Christians go to conferences and do more bible study and go to\n theological college so they can become leaders\n   Jesus' Command  Jesus said \u0026ldquo;teach them to obey everything I have commanded you.\u0026rdquo; He said, \u0026ldquo;Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.\u0026rdquo; He said, \u0026ldquo;Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.\u0026rdquo; Matt 28:20, Lk 11:28, Matt 7:26\n Faith is not understanding and agreeing with doctrinal truth. It is trusting and obeying Jesus. That is how Jesus defines faith.\nTeaching has an important role to play, but only in conjunction with demonstrating and practicing obedience. Discipling is an apprenticeship, not a class-room exercise. The teacher says, \u0026ldquo;Come and follow me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nWe have abandoned the apprenticeship for the classroom because according to Jesus, discipleship starts with demonstrating the Kingdom of God through healing and deliverance. It is so much easier to talk about this than to actually demonstrate it!\nMission Our Tradition We are taught to bring our friends and neighbours to church so they can hear the preaching of the Gospel and be saved. The pastor is the expert and those few who are growing into leadership take a turn now and again.\nJesus' Command  \u0026ldquo;And as you go, preach, saying, \u0026lsquo;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u0026rsquo; Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give \u0026hellip; And whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay at his house until you leave that city.\u0026rdquo; Matt 10:7-11\n Jesus never said to bring people to church so the pastor could minister to them. He said to go into people\u0026rsquo;s homes and give away what you have freely received.\nOur replacement of the simple family assembly with the centralised church organisation has reversed the focus of mission and ministry.\nBecoming a Leader Our Tradition We are taught that the church needs leaders to perform all the various functions and organise all its activities. Leadership positions are often given (and even created) to reward faithfulness and commitment.\nWhen looking for leaders we look for people who agree with us, people who have the skills to lead and organise others, people who are knowledgeable and skilled in using the bible.\nLeadership is organised in a hierarchy under the lead pastor\u0026rsquo;s authority and is used as a means of control. Obedience and submission is expected of those being lead, and the sub-leaders serve the main leader.\nJesus' Command Jesus turns leadership on its head. His church structure is flat rather than hierarchical. He alone is the head, and everyone else reports directly to Him. Leadership is a gift of service to the body of Christ, along with all the other gifts that every member provides.\n\u0026ldquo;You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.\u0026rdquo; Mk 10:42-44\n Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. Rom 12:4-5\n Kingdom leadership depends not upon authority and duty but on vision, inspiration, example, empowerment and love.\nWe have adopted the world\u0026rsquo;s model of leadership within the church, thinking ourselves wiser than Jesus.\nSent and Released\u0026hellip; Our Tradition We are taught that if we feel the calling of God to start a new ministry or leave the church to take the gospel to another place, we need to get the blessing and release of the pastor. Yet the hardest thing for a pastor to do is to release leaders or church members to leave the church to obey their calling to go into all the world and make disciples. These people are probably the keenest, hardest working, most generous givers, closest friends and most ardent supporters of the pastor. The temptation for a pastor is always to say, \u0026ldquo;Just wait a little longer, you are not quite ready yet\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nJesus' Command  \u0026ldquo;As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.\u0026rdquo; Jn 20:21\n\u0026ldquo;The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.\u0026rdquo; Lk 10:2-3\n\u0026ldquo;Freely you received, freely give\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Matt 10:8\n The fact is that none of us are ever ready. There is always more to learn, more to practice, more to be done before we go. We should always seek the blessing of those who have been our Christian family, but in the end we must obey and trust Jesus if he is calling us to go beyond what our leaders are prepared to allow. Jesus was clear that family does not trump obedience to Jesus.

And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.\nEph 1:3-4 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ. For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight.\n2 Pet 1:3 His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. 4Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.\n1: Living in the Gap p34: We struggle with the high promises of scripture, such as \u0026quot;greater things than these will you do\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Whoever drinks of this water will never thirst again\u0026quot;. If only!\nWe may be more used to thinking of Christ as our Saviour outside of me than the one who dwells within me.\np37: John Murray: \u0026quot;Nothing is more central or more basic than union with Christ... it is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation.\u0026quot;\np38: If you have ever asked \u0026quot;Isn't there more to it than this?\u0026quot; The answer is \u0026quot;Yes. Union with Christ is the \u0026quot;more to it.\u0026quot;\np40: Phil 3:12 Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.\n2: Union with Christ - What is it? p42: Col 3:3 For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.\np43: Paul constantly talks about us being \u0026quot;in Christ\u0026quot;. It is the essence of Christian proclamation and experience.\nWe share in His life, obedience, death, resurrection and ascension:\np45: Gal 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.\nRom 6:4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.\nCol 3:1 Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.\nEph 2:6 And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,\np48: Our sin, shame, weakness - everything are covered in Christ. We rest in Him.\n1 Jn 4:18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.\nP49: Jn 14:16-17 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever\u0026mdash;the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.\nP50: Col 1:27 To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.\nJn 14:12 Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.\np51: 2 Cor 13:5 Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you\u0026mdash;unless, of course, you fail the test?\nP52: Eph 1:18-19 I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people, and his incomparably great power for us who believe.\nP54: Union with Christ is not just an idea to be understood, but a new reality to be lived, through faith.\np57: Jn17:26 I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.\u0026quot;\nP58: Eph 4:13-15 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowled 36:26ge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.\n3: Why we need it p60: Rom 12:2 Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.\nEzek 36:26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.\n1 Cor 2:16 But we have the mind of Christ.\nEph 4:24 put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.\n2 Cor 5:16 So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.\nPhil 2:15 that you may become blameless and pure, \u0026quot;children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.\u0026quot; Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky.\nAll these verses suggest great transformation in our character. Yet the reality is that we rarely see such wonderful transformation and most of us feel stuck and unable to change.\nBoth grace and obedience are required.\nP64: Every temptation challenges our belief that the Lord intends only good for us. If we believed that we would never choose sin. Only those who believe God is always full of love and goodness towards us can choose obedience in the face of temptation. This grace changes our perspective.\nP65: But knowledge of that grace, on its own, does not change us:\nJer 6:14 They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. 'Peace, peace,' they say, when there is no peace.\nGrace without obedience is an inadequate dressing for the wound of sin.\nJn 14:15 \u0026quot;If you love me, keep my commands.\nJn 15:14 You are my friends if you do what I command.\nMatt 7:21 \u0026quot;Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\nP67: Using grace as an excuse not to be obedient is utter folly and is contrary to Jesus and the apostles.\nP71: Jesus exemplifies radical grace and radical obedience. We need both.\nP72: Both justification and sanctification come from our union with Christ.\n1 Cor 1:30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.\nP73: Jesus provides grace to cover our sin and power to obey his commands.\nMatt 6:33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.\nPhil 3:12 Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.\nIn Jesus we can be honest about our failures because of His grace, and hopeful of change because of His power in us.\nP75: Addiction to sin occurs when we seek to salve our pain with anything other than Christ. When we reach for something other than Jesus when our hearts are troubled, that something will steal life from us \u0026ndash; with our permission!\nP76: When we feel defeated and accused and full of shame we must remember that Christ is my righteousness and we can boldly approach the Father in confidence. There is no other way to overcome sin.\nP77: But we must also remember that Christ is in me to break the power of sin. We can choose to obey: \u0026quot;That is not who I am any more\u0026quot;.\n1 Jn 4:4 You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.\n4: Union with Christ in the Bible P87: Paul frequently talks about us being \u0026quot;in Christ\u0026quot;. It is not just a nice phrase, it changes everything about us:\n2 Cor 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!\nP88: Union with Christ is a closer union than any that can be imagined:\n1 Cor 12:27 Now you are the body of Christ, and each of you is a member of it.\n1 Cor 3:16 Do you not know that you yourselves are God\u0026rsquo;s temple, and that God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit dwells in you?\nEph 4:24 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.\nEph 5:31-32 Married to Christ\nRom 8:39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\nP89: Abide is John's term for union with Christ: Jn 15:4-5 Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me. I am the vine and you are the branches. The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing.\nP90: Jn 10:10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.\nFor Matthew, Mark and Luke, union with Christ is expressed as the Kingdom of God. For instance the sermon on the mount describes the new Kingdom life that union with Christ makes possible.\nP92: Two most common complains about reading the bible are \u0026quot;I don't get anything out of it!\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;I don't understand it\u0026quot;.\nUnion with Christ give us the expectation that Jesus will speak to us through His word and His spirit will help us to understand.\nP94: Jn 15:9-11 \u0026ldquo;Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love. 10\u0026quot;If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father\u0026rsquo;s commandments and abide in His love. 11\u0026quot;These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.\n5: The Historic Tradition P104: Luther: Christ and the soul become one flesh as in marriage. Everything they have they hold in common, the good as well as the evil. The believing soul can boast of and glory in whatever Christ has as though it were his own.\nP105: Calvin: We do not therefore contemplate him outside ourselves from afar in order that his righteousness may be imputed to us but because we put on Christ and are engrafted into his body \u0026ndash; in short, because He designs to make us one with Him.\n6: Whatever happened to union with Christ? P116: Union with Christ might be the most important doctrine you have never heard of!\nUnion with Christ can come across as obscure, or too heavenly minded to be any earthly use.\nP120: Our culture feeds our self-centredness, encouraging us to enthrone ourselves as the sovereign of our lives. Pride is now embraced and cherished as essential to human flourishing: embrace yourself, express yourself, promote yourself.\nP121: Union with Christ tells us that the most important part of our identity comes from Christ, not ourself. Therefore we need a posture of dependence, vulnerability, waiting and trust.\nA married couple must learn to replace \u0026quot;I\u0026quot; with \u0026quot;we\u0026quot; as their primary frame of reference. The same applies to our union with Christ.\nP124: We like easy soudbites and clear ideas.\nP125: Our desire for clarity can end up narrowing our view of the gospel to the point where we end up at its centre.\nP126: Col 1:16 For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.\nJn 17:21 May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.\nJn 14:21,23 \u0026ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him... If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him.\nP129: Union with Christ opens the door to a world larger and more exciting, more mysterious and more dangerous, than you ever imagined. Your imagination must be captured by a new story so you can keep pressing onward and upward toward this new world, even as you walk with both feet on the ground.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7a630edca3ebb4eb656ef548993fd9c6","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/salvation/union-with-christ/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/salvation/union-with-christ/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Union with Christ \u0026ndash; Notes from Rankin Wilbourne See also my \u0026quot;In Christ\u0026quot; in /Salvation/\nIntroduction P24: Jn 17:3 Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.","tags":null,"title":"Union with Christ","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Walking In Faith  Stephen Dolley February 2013 Contents Introduction 3\nPrayers of faith please God 4\nPart 1 - The Authentic Gospel 7\nThe power of the gospel in a challenging context 7\nHealing is a part of the authentic Gospel 10\nHealing is God\u0026rsquo;s will for Christians 12\nOur Superior Covenant Blessings 14\nPart 2 - How Faith works 18\nGod answers prayer in response to faith 18\nUnbelief hinders answered prayer 19\nFaith is Fact 22\nFaith precedes sight 25\nPart 3 - Finding Faith 27\nOur spirit is not our mind 27\nMental assent is not faith 29\nHope is not faith 31\nDenial is not faith 32\nIs it God\u0026rsquo;s will? 35\nPart 4 - Putting faith to work 38\nReceiving the Spirit 38\nFaith without works is dead 39\nThe Fight of Faith 41\nWalking in victory 44\nFaith brings peace 46\nEmulating Abraham 47\nA Model Prayer for healing 49\nWalking in Faith Introduction Faith is unwavering belief. In fact there is only one Greek word, pistis, which is sometimes translated belief and sometimes faith. To have faith is to believe with all your heart. If you are born again then you are a believer; that is God has given you faith; the ability to believe Him and His word. This study is about putting our believing into practice, exercising the faith God has given us for the very purpose He has given it: that is to believe His word.\n\u0026ldquo;Faith comes from hearing (or reading) the message and the message is heard through the word of Christ.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 10:17) But we should not mistake faith for intellectual knowledge. We may have God\u0026rsquo;s word in our mind and say we believe it, because we know we are supposed to believe it, but we only truly believe when we believe with our hearts. We hear with our ears, understand with our minds and believe with our hearts, \u0026ldquo;for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified\u0026rdquo; (Rom 10:10). It is this last stage that we so often fail to practice.\nHow can we know if we believe with our heart? Because we act on it. As James said, \u0026ldquo;faith without works is dead.\u0026rdquo; When we truly and joyfully believe God\u0026rsquo;s word we will eagerly and joyfully act on it.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s word is the most precious earthly possession we have. God has given us \u0026ldquo;his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires\u0026rdquo; (2Pet 1:4). If we are to benefit from these promises and participate in the divine nature, then we must read and study and meditate on these promises until we believe them with all our heart and so prove that \u0026ldquo;all the promises of God find their YES in him.\u0026rdquo; (2Cor 1:20 RSV).\nFor this reason, \u0026ldquo;do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.\u0026rdquo; God assures us \u0026ldquo;Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go.\u0026rdquo; (Jos 1:8-9)\nWe can be fully confident in God\u0026rsquo;s promises, for \u0026ldquo;God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfil?\u0026quot;(Num 23:19) No! God assures us \u0026ldquo;I am watching to see that my word is fulfilled\u0026rdquo; (Jer 1:12).\nPrayers of faith please God People always want to know, \u0026ldquo;What is the secret of your ministry?\u0026rdquo; I think the big discovery for me was that God is pleased when I move out in faith because I am believing His promises. It is this deep conviction that it pleases God which carries me forward.\nThe verse most Christians know about pleasing God is:\n \u0026ldquo;For without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him\u0026rdquo; (Heb 11:6).\n All through the scriptures we see that it is people putting their trust in God for His protection and provision that pleases Him. And on the other hand, it is plain that Jesus was frustrated by the faithlessness of His disciples:\nO faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? (Matt 17:17)\nIf you want to please Jesus rather than frustrate Him then you need to be courageous in your faith. The Devil tries to persuade us that God is a distant and reluctant giver who needs to be \u0026ldquo;sweetened\u0026rdquo; by extra effort at being righteous and cajoled with long and loud prayers. Satan tells us that the more we pray the more likely God is to hear, and the more people we get praying the more likely God is to answer. And even if God does hear us and answer, then the answer will most likely be \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Wait\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;. These are lies we must resist. God has made us righteous in Christ, loves to hear us pray and is eager to grant our requests. Paul encourages us to believe that God\u0026rsquo;s answer is \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; when we pray:\n \u0026ldquo;all the promises of God find their YES in him.\u0026rdquo; (2Cor 1:20 RSV).\n Jesus assures us that coming to Him with our requests is not tiresome for Him, but rather it gives Him great pleasure to answer our prayers:\n\u0026quot;But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you. Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father\u0026rsquo;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. (Lk 12:31-32)\nBut not only does it delight the Father when we come to Him with prayers of faith, it also glorifies Him:\nIf you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. This is to my Father\u0026rsquo;s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. (Jn 15:7-8)\nJesus takes personal responsibility for our prayers being answered, so that He may bring glory to the Father:\n\u0026ldquo;And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. (Jn 14:13-14)\nThe motive Jesus gives us for asking is not only the Fathers pleasure, and the Son\u0026rsquo;s pleasure, but our own pleasure as well:\n\u0026ldquo;I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.\u0026rdquo; (Joh 15:11)\n\u0026ldquo;In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.\u0026rdquo; (Joh 16:23-24)\nIt is clear that Jesus knew it would be difficult for us to accept that God actually wants to hear and grant our requests. Again and again he repeated His promise that God would not only answer our prayers, but actually grant our requests:\n \u0026ldquo;If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!\u0026rdquo; (Matt 7:11)\n But there is even more reason than God\u0026rsquo;s pleasure for Him answering our prayers. The Devil wants people to believe that the Christian faith is just words and ideas with no present powerful reality; that its all just \u0026ldquo;pie in the sky when you die.\u0026rdquo; That until we get to heaven Satan rules and sin and sickness will remain our masters. But this is not the Gospel Jesus preached. Jesus announced:\n\u0026ldquo;good news to the poor, freedom for the prisoners, recovery of sight for the blind and release for the oppressed. To proclaim the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 4:18-19)\n\u0026ldquo;The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil\u0026rsquo;s work.\u0026rdquo; (1Jo 3:8)\nPaul was insistent in His preaching that:\n \u0026ldquo;The kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 4:20)\n If we want to please God then let us be sure that we proclaim the Gospel of forgiveness and healing and that we pray in the full confidence that in boldly asking God for the demonstration of His Kingdom here on earth, we are pleasing Him and He will certainly grant our requests.\nWe have inherited precious and very great promises, and God\u0026rsquo;s answer to them is \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;. This is ground upon which we stand and from where we will not be shifted. As Paul said, \u0026ldquo;Let God be true and every man a liar\u0026rdquo;. (Rom 3:4) Believing God in faith-filled prayers is fun and so much nicer than struggling with unbelief!\n\u0026ldquo;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.\u0026rdquo; (Ro 15:13)\nPart 1 - The Authentic Gospel The power of the gospel in a challenging context Life as a Christian in this fallen world is often very challenging. Just because we have inherited God\u0026rsquo;s precious and very great promises does not mean that we will not suffer from the godless behaviour of others. \u0026ldquo;Stephen, a man full of God\u0026rsquo;s grace and power, did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people\u0026rdquo; (Ac 6:8) but he was martyred. Paul likewise was full of grace and power but he suffered greatly from physical attack at the hands of unbelievers, on at least one occasion being stoned and left for dead (Acts 14:19) Paul addresses the issue of presenting the gospel in a challenging context at some length in writing to the Corinthians.\n\u0026ldquo;Therefore, since through God\u0026rsquo;s mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart. Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man\u0026rsquo;s conscience in the sight of God. \u0026hellip; But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body. So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you. It is written: \u0026ldquo;I believed; therefore I have spoken.\u0026rdquo; With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak, because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence. All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God. Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.\u0026rdquo; (2Co 4:1-18)\nThere are a number of key points to notice here.\n  We must not lose heart. Satan will try everything he can to discourage us (lit. to take away our courage). This we must determine not to allow. Nothing we face can undo the promises of God, remove us from His love or disable God from watching over His promises to perform them (Jer 1:12).\n  We must not fake it. It is tempting to pretend things are better than they are or that something has happened when it hasn\u0026rsquo;t. We are not as like Jesus as we should be and we understand in part the unsearchable wisdom of God. Even Paul made definite plans which never worked out (2Cor 1:17).\n  We must not distort the word of God. The preachers greatest temptation is to distort the word of God to make it say what we want it to say for the purpose of our sermon. It is very difficult to avoid this completely however careful we are, but we must \u0026ldquo;Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.\u0026rdquo; (2Tim 2:15)\n  We must set forth the truth plainly. Our job is to tell the truth of the Gospel that God gives us in the scriptures. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. If Jesus says that the kingdom is accompanied by healing, that is the Gospel we must proclaim. If Jesus says that God acts in response to our faith, that is the Gospel we must proclaim. If Jesus says that He Himself is the judge of all mankind then we must not hesitate to say so. Jesus defines the Gospel, not the sensibilities of our present society. Jesus, not Caesar, is Lord of all the earth. If we plainly speak the truth delivered to us by Jesus then we \u0026ldquo;commend ourselves to every man\u0026rsquo;s conscience in the sight of God.\u0026rdquo;\n  We have this treasure in jars of clay. The Gospel is amazing \u0026ndash; we are not! Our frailty and imperfections are not a hindrance to the gospel, but on the contrary, they make it all the clearer that it is God\u0026rsquo;s power at work and not ours.\n  The Gospel shows all-surpassing power. If there is no power, nothing is shown! There is to be a stark contrast between the clay vessels and His all-surpassing power. The Gospel is not clay vessels, it is the power of God for salvation. (Rom 1:16)\n  Our body displays both the death and the life of Jesus. Jesus died at the hands of sinners. The display of the death of Jesus in our bodies is not in sickness and the frailty of old age but in the cuts and bruises and broken bones received from others because we have stood our ground in proclaiming God\u0026rsquo;s Gospel. Or perhaps it is the lost promotion or opportunities because we refuse to act corruptly in our work. Nowhere in the bible is sickness spoken of as a way of sharing in Christ\u0026rsquo;s sufferings. Jesus was never sick. The only way we share in Christ\u0026rsquo;s sufferings is when we suffer as a result of our faith. But Paul is clear that it is not just the death of Jesus that is displayed in his body, but also the life of Jesus. Every time he suffered so terribly in persecutions, God raised him up again. His body displayed both the scars of persecution and the insuppressible healing life of Jesus \u0026ndash; also in his mortal body. Our mortal bodies, not just our hearts or spirits, are supposed to display the life of Jesus. This is through vitality and health, not sickness and decay.\n  With that same spirit of faith we believe and therefore speak. Paul is very much in line with Jesus on the issue of faith. We believe and therefore speak; not like the west-trained person, we see therefore we believe therefore we speak. The resurrection of Jesus is enough to prove God\u0026rsquo;s power and passion for His word. Faith enables us to speak out the truth because of our confidence in God before ever we see the thing we are speaking of. That is what faith does; it is how faith works.\n  We fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen. Unbelievers and those who have lost heart look at what is seen, waiting to see the evidence of what is being hoped for. Believers do not look at the present visible realities. Their eyes are fixed on Jesus. They see the unseen realities of the promises of God being fulfilled. They see the answer to their prayer which is about to replace the temporary present visible reality. What is seen is temporary. God has changed it in response to my prayer of faith. God and His faithfulness is eternal.\n  Despite the many challenges and considerable difficulties that Paul faced as he preached the Gospel it is clear that he never shrank from proclaiming the power of God in the gospel. In writing to the Romans about his ministry he says:\n\u0026ldquo;I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done\u0026mdash; by the power of signs and miracles, through the power of the Spirit.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 15:18-19)\nHealing is a part of the authentic Gospel The miracle of rebirth \u0026ndash; a person being born-again and filled with the Holy Spirit \u0026ndash; is received by faith. Part of God\u0026rsquo;s provision to help unbelievers have faith in the Gospel of salvation is to accompany the preaching of the gospel with signs and wonders \u0026ndash; usually healing miracles. Healing has a two-fold role in proclaiming the gospel. Firstly it demonstrates the reality of the salvation that God brings. It is not just an invisible salvation from God\u0026rsquo;s judgement of our sin, it is also a visible salvation from the sickness that has come as a result of the fall, so that \u0026ldquo;your faith may not rest on the wisdom of men but on the power of God\u0026rdquo; (1Cor 2:5).\n\u0026ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour.\u0026rdquo; (Lk 4:18-19)\nBut secondly, healing is a demonstration of God\u0026rsquo;s approval of the message being preached. As one gospel witness put it, \u0026ldquo;No-one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him\u0026rdquo; (Jn 3:2). Jesus repeatedly pointed to the healing miracles as proof that His message was authentic - people were being healed and delivered from the power of Satan (Matt 11:4-5, John 14:11). Jesus sent the disciples off with the same message and the same authenticating signs.\nWhen Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. (Lk 9:1)\nAnd these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well. (Mk 16:17-18)\nThe disciples continued to preach the gospel with signs following after Jesus' ascension.\n \u0026ldquo;Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.\u0026rdquo; (Ac 2:43)\n \u0026ldquo;Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there. When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said. With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed. So there was great joy in that city.\u0026rdquo; (Ac 8:5-8)\n\u0026ldquo;I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done\u0026mdash; by the power of signs and miracles, through the power of the Spirit.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 15:18-19)\n \u0026ldquo;My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit\u0026rsquo;s power, so that your faith might not rest on men\u0026rsquo;s wisdom, but on God\u0026rsquo;s power.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 2:4-5)\n\u0026ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 4:20)\n \u0026ldquo;This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.\u0026rdquo; (Heb 2:3-4)\nThere can be no doubt that it was and is Jesus' intention that signs and wonders and particularly healing should be a routine part of presenting the gospel. Freedom from Satan\u0026rsquo;s power does not only relate to spiritual matters, but also to the curse of the flesh \u0026ndash; sickness. These signs authenticate the gospel and demonstrate that the Christian faith is not just about ideas and words, but the power of God to change lives and deliver people from the devils works.\n\u0026ldquo;The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil\u0026rsquo;s work.\u0026rdquo; (1Jo 3:8)\nHealing is God\u0026rsquo;s will for Christians But healing is not just for authenticating the preaching of the gospel. It is important to understand that healing and general blessing is God\u0026rsquo;s declared will for us as Christians. When we pray for healing, depending on God\u0026rsquo;s word, we are praying in accord with His will and pleasing Him by our faith. \u0026ldquo;For without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him\u0026rdquo; (Heb 11:6).\nWe must not fall for the devils lies that obtaining healing requires extracting something from God that He is reluctant or uncertain to give.\n\u0026ldquo;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: \u0026lsquo;Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.'\u0026rdquo; (The curse of the law was poverty, sickness and death for disobedience.) \u0026ldquo;He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.\u0026rdquo; (Gal 3:13-14)\n\u0026ldquo;Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.\u0026rdquo; (Isa 53:4-5)\nThis was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: \u0026ldquo;He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases.\u0026rdquo; (Mt 8:17)\n\u0026ldquo;He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.\u0026rdquo; (1Pe 2:24)\n\u0026ldquo;Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.\u0026rdquo; (Jas 5:14-16)\nI have discussed the application of Isa 53:4-5 and its NT quotations (Mt 8:17, 1Pe 2:24) in my notes \u0026ldquo;Jesus, the Kingdom and Healing, Part 5 - The Biblical Foundations for healing\u0026rdquo;. Suffice to say here that the apostles taught and practiced the expectation of divine healing in the understanding that it was certainly God\u0026rsquo;s will. James does not encourage prayer for healing because it sometimes helps but because God has already promised. Notice how he mirrors Jesus\u0026rsquo; teaching on faith: \u0026ldquo;the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; the condition upon which healing depends is not God\u0026rsquo;s will, but the faith of the one praying. In response to a faith-filled prayer, James has no hesitation in declaring, \u0026ldquo;the Lord will raise him up\u0026rdquo; and then, as a bonus, \u0026ldquo;If he has sinned, he will be forgiven.\u0026rdquo; Here we see the confident declaration that God acts in grace towards sinners. Healing and forgiveness is given to undeserving sinners.\nWe can confidently declare with James that healing is certainly God\u0026rsquo;s will and it is obtained by the prayer of faith. In the light of healing being so much part of Jesus' ministry, and his commission to the disciples, healing is surely included in the following:\n\u0026ldquo;And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you.\u0026rdquo; (Ro 8:11)\n\u0026ldquo;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all\u0026mdash;how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?\u0026rdquo; (Ro 8:32)\n\u0026ldquo;We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body.\u0026rdquo; (2Co 4:10-11)\nWe need have no doubt that it is God\u0026rsquo;s will for the life of the risen Christ to be manifest through health in our mortal bodies.\nOur Superior Covenant Blessings The New Testament is bold in its proclamation that in Christ we are brought into a new and better covenant than Moses' covenant of Law which constituted the Jewish faith.\n\u0026ldquo;But the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, and it is founded on better promises.\u0026rdquo; (Heb 8:6)\nThe New covenant is even better! Under the Old Covenant God\u0026rsquo;s presence was hidden away in the temple behind a great thick curtain where only the high priest could go, and that, only once a year. But now, in Christ\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honour God with your body.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 6:19-20)\nWe are God\u0026rsquo;s temple, filled with the Holy Spirit. But note that Paul does not say our spirit is the temple, but he specifically says \u0026ldquo;your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit.\u0026rdquo; Paul uses this fact to urge his readers not to commit sexual sin. But it has wider implications. Jesus said that His Kingdom was not of this world, but that certainly did not mean that it has no implications or visibility in this world. On the contrary, wherever the Kingdom of God was proclaimed its implications broke into this present physical world \u0026ndash; the sick were healed and the oppressed set free. So much so that Paul says that creation is moved to jealousy awaiting the day when \u0026ldquo;creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God\u0026rdquo; (Rom 8:17-23).1\nSince we are to honour God with our body we should ensure that healing, not sickness, reigns in our body. Not only have our spirits been purchased by Christ, but our bodies have too. We belong to the Kingdom of God, which is not merely a matter of words, \u0026ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 4:20)\nAlthough Jesus' kingdom is not of this world, we have been brought into His kingdom:\n\u0026ldquo;giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,\u0026rdquo; (Col 1:12-13)\nIn this kingdom we know we are under God\u0026rsquo;s blessing and recipients of His many and great promises (2Pet 1:4).\n\u0026ldquo;For no matter how many promises God has made, they are \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; in Christ. And so through him the \u0026ldquo;Amen\u0026rdquo; is spoken by us to the glory of God.\u0026rdquo; (2Co 1:20)\nOne of these promises, which Paul specifically applies to gentile believers is blessing and long life:\n\u0026ldquo;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. \u0026lsquo;Honour your father and mother\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;which is the first commandment with a promise\u0026mdash; \u0026lsquo;that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.'\u0026rdquo; (Eph 6:1-3)\nPaul is confident that we can take these promises given under the old covenant and know that in Christ, when we bring these promises to God, His answer is \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Amen\u0026rdquo;. Even David under the Old Covenant had confidence in God for healing:\nThe LORD will sustain him on his sick-bed and restore him from his bed of illness. (Ps 41:3)\n\u0026ldquo;Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits\u0026mdash; who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases\u0026rdquo; (Ps 103:2-3).\nSo what is the nature of the blessings we have inherited? Abraham\u0026rsquo;s blessing was threefold in nature:\n1. It was a material or a financial blessing (Gen 13:2,15; Deut 28:4-12).\n2. It was a physical blessing (Gen 13:16; 17:16; Ex 15:26; 23:25-26).\n3. It was a spiritual blessing (Gal 3:14).\nThese blessings were made conditional for Israel under the Law of Moses:\n\u0026ldquo;if you will diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD your god, and do that which is right in his eyes, and give heed to his commandments and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon you which I put upon the Egyptians; for I am the LORD, your healer.\u0026rdquo; (Ex 15:26)\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD will send a blessing on your barns and on everything you put your hand to. The LORD your God will bless you in the land he is giving you.\u0026rdquo; (De 28:8)\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD will grant you abundant prosperity\u0026mdash;in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your ground\u0026mdash;in the land he swore to your forefathers to give you. The LORD will open the heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. The LORD will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom.\u0026rdquo; (De 28:11-13)\nWe have been delivered from the curse of the Law which, until Jesus came, the people of God were under. We have been made righteous in God\u0026rsquo;s sight and so now all the promises of God find their \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; in Christ.\nIf you want to see how superior our covenant is and grow strong in your faith, then I recommend you list all the scriptures in the epistles that have the expression \u0026ldquo;in Him,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;in Christ,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;in whom,\u0026rdquo; referring to Jesus (134 of them!). If you make a habit of confessing who you are and what you have from these scriptures you will become mighty in faith.\nPart 2 - How Faith works God answers prayer in response to faith Jesus made it quite clear that miracles and answered prayer was God\u0026rsquo;s will for us, yet it depends to a large extent on our faith; our confident belief that we will get what we ask for.\nJesus taught this very plainly.\n\u0026ldquo;Everything is possible for him who believes\u0026hellip; I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, \u0026lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,\u0026rsquo; and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 11:22-24)\nHe replied, \u0026ldquo;Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, \u0026lsquo;Move from here to there\u0026rsquo; and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 17:20)\nJesus replied, \u0026ldquo;I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig-tree, but also you can say to this mountain, \u0026lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,\u0026rsquo; and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 21:21-22)\nIt is evident that New Testament believers were taught to have this confidence.\n\u0026ldquo;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all\u0026mdash;how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?\u0026rdquo; (Ro 8:32)\n\u0026ldquo;This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us\u0026mdash;whatever we ask\u0026mdash;we know that we have what we asked of him.\u0026rdquo; (1Jo 5:14-15)\n\u0026ldquo;Yet you do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures. (Jas 4:2-3)\nJesus healed people who had faith for healing:\n\u0026ldquo;According to your faith will it be done to you\u0026rdquo; (Mt 9:29) \u0026ndash; healing the blind man.\n\u0026ldquo;Everything is possible for him who believes.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 9:23) \u0026ndash; casting out a demon.\n\u0026ldquo;Daughter, your faith has healed you.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 5:34) \u0026ndash; woman with flow of blood\nThe disciples healed people who had faith for healing:\n\u0026ldquo;In Lystra there sat a man crippled in his feet, who was lame from birth and had never walked. He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed and called out, \u0026ldquo;Stand up on your feet!\u0026rdquo; At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.\u0026rdquo; (Ac 14:7-10)\n[]{#_Toc349392282 .anchor}So we see that faith in the one receiving from God is crucial. This is a big challenge in the developed world where the primary dependence for health is on the medical profession. But in all cultures, faith for a visible healing seems to be much more difficult than for healing aches and pains. It takes love and grace and care when ministering to a sick person with little faith. We must do all we can to help them catch our faith, confess the faith they do have and act on that faith in some way. Our faith in ministering will communicate and be responded to by those we pray for but in fact love is the most effective means of helping someone come to faith. A mighty man of faith who just goes along a line touching people does nothing to nurture the bruised faith of a hurting soul. But love will fan a flicker of faith into a bright flame.\nUnbelief hinders answered prayer Even Jesus was limited in His miracles by the faith or unbelief of those around Him.\n\u0026ldquo;He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. And he was amazed at their lack of faith.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 6:5-6)\nIf even Jesus required faith in those being healed, it is hardly surprising if that is the case for us also. I think this goes a long way to explaining why healing is far easier in Africa than it is in the west. We in the west are taught to be sceptical not believing. On occasions Jesus took people aside to heal them.\nJesus said, \u0026quot;Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep.\u0026quot; But they laughed at him. After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. (Matt 9:24-25) (Healing Jairus\u0026rsquo; daughter)\nThere some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man. After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man\u0026rsquo;s ears. Then he spat and touched the man\u0026rsquo;s tongue. (Mk 7:32-33)\nThey came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spat on the man\u0026rsquo;s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, \u0026ldquo;Do you see anything?\u0026rdquo; He looked up and said, \u0026ldquo;I see people; they look like trees walking around.\u0026rdquo; Once more Jesus put his hands on the man\u0026rsquo;s eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. Jesus sent him home, saying, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t go into the village.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 8:22-26)\nIt seems likely that the reason Jesus took these two people away from the crowds was the same as with Jairus' daughter, the atmosphere of unbelief. This perhaps is also why the blind man was told not to go back into the village \u0026ndash; he would have been in danger of losing his healing through their unbelief. Where onlookers are sceptical, prayer should be conducted in private.\nIt is not only the faith of the recipient that needs to be protected, but also the faith of the one ministering. Perhaps this is what happened when the disciples failed to cast the demon out after the transfiguration (Lk 9). By then they had a track record of success in dealing with demons (Lk 9:1, 10:17). But a father brought them his son for deliverance and perhaps he was a little dubious about the disciples praying, preferring the Master Himself. He was certainly struggling to find faith for he later said to Jesus, \u0026ldquo;If you can do anything, take pity on us and help us\u0026hellip; help me overcome my unbelief!\u0026rdquo; (Mk 9:22) It is evident that this poor father was gripped by fear and unbelief. Perhaps this infected the disciples, for when they saw the boy convulsing on the ground (as he also did for Jesus) they started to doubt. However, had the disciples stood fast on the authority that Jesus had given them, they would have succeeded, for Jesus had given them authority over \u0026ldquo;every demon\u0026rdquo; (Lk 9:1). Jesus came to the rescue:\nJesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed from that moment. Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, \u0026ldquo;Why couldn\u0026rsquo;t we drive it out?\u0026rdquo; He replied, \u0026ldquo;Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, \u0026lsquo;Move from here to there\u0026rsquo; and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u0026rdquo; (Mt 17:18-20)\nThe Greek word translated \u0026ldquo;little\u0026rdquo; faith can equally be translated \u0026ldquo;short-lived\u0026rdquo; faith, and that seems to be the meaning here. Jesus said they didn\u0026rsquo;t need big faith, but only faith as small as a mustard seed. We should not be persuaded by the devil that our faith is too small or too weak. The problem was not the smallness of their faith but that they gave up on it. It was short-lived. As soon as they saw the boy fitting they said, \u0026ldquo;We cannot do it\u0026rdquo;.\nThis was the same problem with Peter walking on the water. His faith was not too small \u0026ndash; he is the only man known to have walked on water other than Jesus. But his faith was short-lived. When he saw the wind he was afraid. He let go of his great faith.\nPeter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came towards Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \u0026ldquo;Lord, save me!\u0026rdquo; Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \u0026ldquo;You of little (short-lived) faith,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;why did you doubt?\u0026rdquo; (Mt 14:29-31)\nOften Jesus intervenes when our faith fails, as in the incidents above. But in each case Jesus rebuked the disciples for their failed faith because He wanted them to succeed by their own faith, not His. We must keep our eyes firmly on Jesus and keep our faith fighting fit. When the disciples saw the boy fitting and when Peter saw the weather they gave up believing. It is persevering faith, not great faith, that wins the victory.\nWe do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised. (Heb 6:12)\nSo do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. (Heb 10:35-36)\nRemember, unbelief caused Israel to spend 40 years wandering in the desert when they could have entered the promised land.\nFaith is Fact We have seen the importance of faith and the danger of unbelief, but how do we get faith? Where does it come from? Many people seem to think that faith is just wishful thinking, wanting something to be true or that it is blind belief in something for which there is no evidence. This is not the faith of the Bible. Whenever God asks us to have faith He points to evidence upon which our faith should be based. We have faith in God doing the \u0026ldquo;impossible\u0026rdquo; because He created everything out of nothing (Jer 32:17), we have faith in Jesus' teaching because of the miracles (Jn 14:11), we believe Jesus was the Son of God because God raised Him from death. It is because faith is evidence based that it is strengthened through trials. The issue that determines our faith is the evidence we chose to look at, and the challenge of faith is that the evidence is so often unseen or at least somewhat removed from the issue we are confronting.\nFor instance, when praying for healing the immediate evidence is sickness and defeat. But we need to look to the less immediate evidence of previous healings, the promises of God, the evidence for the gospel in changed lives and the inner witness of the Holy Spirit. Faith is based on fact, but we have to choose the facts.\nWe often look to biblical promises as a source of faith, but promises are the foundation of hope not faith. Facts are the foundation of faith. For example, in a promise God says, \u0026ldquo;I will deliver you from all your fears.\u0026rdquo; This gives us hope. But this hope will not deliver us from fear. A fearful Christian can memorise and quote this promise a thousand times without ever being delivered from fear. They may say, \u0026ldquo;One day God will deliver me, because I have this promise\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; But they may never be free from fear. This is because God\u0026rsquo;s promises require faith for them to work, and the promise does not produce faith.\nTo find faith for this promise we need to look for facts. What reasons are there to believe that God will perform His promise? What biblical and historical records show me that God is faithful to perform His promises? What has God already done to fulfil this promise? To these facts the Holy Spirit adds His witness in our spirits. Faith transforms the promise into an experienced reality. \u0026ldquo;Faith is the substance of things hoped for\u0026rdquo; (Heb 11:1 NKJV).\nSome promises have been transformed into fact by what Jesus has done:\n\u0026ldquo;Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.\u0026rdquo; (Isa 53:4-5)\nOriginally this was a promise upon which the hope of a coming messiah was based. But the promise has been fulfilled in Jesus and so now it has become a statement of fact. For Christians it is a foundation, not of hope, but of faith. We do not hope that Jesus took our sins and obtained our healing, it has been done. The matter is not one of hope but of faith.\nHealing comes to us because of facts, established in history, not because of hope in future promises. Jesus didn\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;I will heal you if you pray right and if it is my Fathers will.\u0026rdquo; He said, \u0026ldquo;All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me \u0026hellip; Go and place your hands on the sick and they will get well.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 28:18, Mk 16:15-18). The statement of fact comes first (All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me) and is the foundation for faith. The promise (the sick will get well) flows from that fact and gives us hope that our prayers will be answered. Faith in the fact of Jesus' authority turns that promise of healing into present reality.\nWhen looking at the promises of scripture, look for the facts that they are based on. It is those facts that are the foundation of faith in those promises. Here is another example:\n\u0026ldquo;Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.\u0026rdquo; (James 5:14-16)\n(Note in the next verse Elijah, \u0026ldquo;a man with like passions as us\u0026rdquo; is quoted as being righteous. By faith in Christ we are righteous, not because we are especially sanctified).\nHere James makes the promise, on behalf of God, that the Lord will raise up a sick person in response to the prayer of faith. Note how confidently the promise is expressed - \u0026hellip; will make \u0026hellip; will raise \u0026hellip;will be. This promised is based on a statement of fact: \u0026ldquo;The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.\u0026rdquo; This fact is offered as the foundation of faith in the promise.\nHere are some more examples:\n\u0026quot;But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you. Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father\u0026rsquo;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. (Lk 12:31-32)\nIf you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. This is to my Father\u0026rsquo;s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. (Jn 15:7-8)\nAgain we see Jesus giving a promise and then making a statement of fact upon which faith in the promise is founded. If you want to grow strong in your faith, look to the facts, not just the promises.\nFaith precedes sight Although faith is indeed founded on fact, that is not all there is to it. Faith is founded on fact, but then launches out in courage to take hold of the promise. Most of us are inclined to be like Thomas: the only facts that matter are the ones our ordinary senses can tell us. We believe it when we see it. Only when we receive what we are asking God for do we believe we have it. Jesus rebuked the disciples for their unbelief and blessed those who believe without first seeing:\nThomas said to them, \u0026ldquo;Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 20:25)\nLater Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen. (Mk 16:14)\nFaith works the other way around. What pleases God is when we believe we have our petition before we see it.\nThen Jesus told him, \u0026ldquo;Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 20:29)\nAlthough these two quotes are not in the context of prayer, they are examples of natural unbelief on the one hand and the kind of people God blesses on the other. Jesus was absolutely clear about the kind of faith that pleases God:\n\u0026ldquo;I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, \u0026lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,\u0026rsquo; and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 11:23-24)\nNote there are three stages in receiving a request here. The pre-prayer faith the post-prayer faith and receiving the outcome. Pre-prayer faith says \u0026ldquo;What I say will happen\u0026rdquo;. Post-prayer faith says \u0026ldquo;I have received it\u0026rdquo;. It is only after these two aspects of faith have been played out that the final stage occurs, \u0026ldquo;it will be yours.\u0026rdquo;\nGenuine faith goes beyond asking. It includes the confident belief that having prayed God has granted the request. John says the same thing, several decades later, writing as an old man:\n\u0026ldquo;This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us\u0026mdash;whatever we ask\u0026mdash;we know that we have what we asked of him.\u0026rdquo; (1Jo 5:14-15)\nFaith does not look at the visible facts and say, \u0026ldquo;Oh! God has not answered\u0026rdquo; but looks at the faith-facts and says \u0026ldquo;He who promised is faithful. I have received what I asked from God.\u0026rdquo; After we have done this, Jesus says, \u0026ldquo;It will be done for you. It will be yours.\u0026rdquo;\nWe should not be surprised that faith works like this. It is how salvation works. The new creation starts in the spirit by faith and works its way into our flesh. In the same way healing and other answers to prayer start in our spirit before being manifest in the flesh. It may manifest in our flesh immediately or it may take time to develop in our flesh. We are called to walk by faith, not sight. Abraham had not-seeing faith:\n\u0026ldquo;We live by faith, not by sight.\u0026rdquo; (2Co 5:7) (Context is our hope for resurrection)\n\u0026ldquo;So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.\u0026rdquo; (2Cor 4:18)\nAbraham is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed\u0026mdash;the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were. Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, \u0026ldquo;So shall your offspring be.\u0026rdquo; Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead\u0026mdash;since he was about a hundred years old\u0026mdash;and that Sarah\u0026rsquo;s womb was also dead. Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 4:17-21)\nYou cannot get Abraham\u0026rsquo;s blessing with Thomas' faith (\u0026ldquo;When I see, then I will believe.\u0026quot;) But if we are born again, we have Abraham\u0026rsquo;s faith; that is how we got saved.\n\u0026ldquo;Understand, then, that those who believe are children of Abraham.\u0026rdquo; (Ga 3:7)\n\u0026ldquo;If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u0026rsquo;s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\u0026rdquo; (Ga 3:29)\nPart 3 - Finding Faith Our spirit is not our mind We may have some promises and found the facts that God has given to establish our faith, but that is still not the same as having faith. Faith resides in our spirits, not in our minds:\n\u0026ldquo;For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 10:10)\nScripture speaks of us having a spirit, a soul and a body (1Thess 5:23). The soul refers to our mind \u0026ndash; the place of our intellect, reasoning and emotions. Our spirit is the part that was dead before we were born again and has the capacity to relate to God and receive understanding of God\u0026rsquo;s will and faith to believe Him.\n\u0026ldquo;So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 14:15)\nThe scriptures use heart/inner self/spirit interchangeably, and mind/soul/natural man interchangeably.\n\u0026ldquo;But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 2:14 NKJV)\n\u0026ldquo;For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 7:22)\nWhen we are born again our spirit is renewed, but our minds and bodies need to be brought into line with our spirit.\n\u0026ldquo;Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God\u0026rsquo;s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God\u0026mdash;this is your spiritual act of worship. Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God\u0026rsquo;s will is\u0026mdash;his good, pleasing and perfect will.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 12:1-2)\nGod works in our spirit, but we have to work that out in our bodies and minds. We must renew our own minds with God\u0026rsquo;s word. We must offer our bodies and minds to God as instruments of righteousness (Rom 6:13). When we are born again our spirits are fully redeemed but we await in confident hope for the total renewal of our minds and bodies when we see Jesus:\n\u0026ldquo;Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure.\u0026rdquo; (1Jo 3:3)\nThe scriptures use the word heart to refer to our human, God enlivened spirit, not to our minds. \u0026ldquo;he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men but from God.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 2:29 NKJV)\nThe spirit relates to the spiritual realm, the soul to the intellectual and emotional realm and the body to the physical realm. It is not the soul/mind that believes for salvation but the spirit; \u0026ldquo;It is with the heart that we believe\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (Rom 10:10). Thus we may often find that our minds are not renewed and our intellect, emotions and reason is offended by our faith. If to believe that you have received what you cannot yet perceive is troublesome \u0026ndash; so be it. We believe with our spirits, not our souls; with our hearts not our minds. Let it be our spirit that renews our minds, not our minds that quench our spirit.\nFaith, the ability to believe God, is given to us when we are saved. We can feed our spirit through prayer and meditation on God\u0026rsquo;s word and through fellowship with other Christians. But recognising that faith resides in our spirit is important. We are so used to operating out of our intellect and physical skills that we can imagine that these are what counts in God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom. But Paul cautions us:\nFor by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you. (Rom 12:3)\nThis is written in the context of serving within the church. God is looking for faith, not just faithful service. He wants to promote faith and have leaders who \u0026ldquo;by faith and patience inherit the promises\u0026rdquo; (Heb 6:12). So we are to consider the health of our faith, not the strength of our skills in assessing ourselves and the same assessment must be made when selecting leaders. Thank God for our skills and intellect, but our spirit is not our mind.\nMental assent is not faith Having seen that faith resides in our spirit not our minds, we can see that it is wrong to look to our understanding for faith:\n\u0026ldquo;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight. Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and shun evil.\u0026rdquo; (Pr 3:5-7)\nWe may say we believe that the bible is true and that the Gospels are a reliable record of Jesus words and ministry. But that is not faith. The problem is that we use \u0026ldquo;the faith\u0026rdquo; to refer to the body of doctrine which comprises Christian beliefs. This should not be confused with the faith that is required to please God and obtain answered prayer.\nSalvation comes to us when we believe Jesus with our heart:\n\u0026ldquo;For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 10:10)\nWe believe and then demonstrate our faith by confessing our salvation. God responds by giving His Spirit to make us into a new creation. After believing we enter into rest; faith comes first.\n\u0026ldquo;Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.\u0026rdquo; (Heb 11:1)\n\u0026ldquo;Now we who have believed enter that rest\u0026rdquo; (Heb 4:3)\n\u0026ldquo;Let God be true, and every man a liar.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 3:4)\nJust as saving faith belongs to our hearts so also does on-going faith for answered prayer. If you say, \u0026ldquo;I believe the bible, but I do not have my petition\u0026rdquo; then you have mental assent not faith. In fact, you are fooling yourself that believe. You may want to believe, but in fact you don\u0026rsquo;t. If you did believe you would be saying, \u0026ldquo;I have my answer.\u0026rdquo; The mind says, \u0026ldquo;I believe it but I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why I haven\u0026rsquo;t got it.\u0026rdquo; The heart says \u0026ldquo;I have it, even though I can\u0026rsquo;t see it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, \u0026lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,\u0026rsquo; and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 11:23)\nIf you are eager to confess to other believers (not doubters) that you have the thing you are believing for, then you can be sure you have faith in your heart, \u0026ldquo;for out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks\u0026rdquo; (Lk 6:45). But if you are afraid to confess it except to God then you do not have faith, but hope. Keep praying and meditating on the scriptures and speaking truth until you have faith. Faith grows as we give glory to God (Rom 4:20).\nHope is not faith Many people have hope and think it is faith, but hope and faith are different things with different purposes and must not be confused. Paul said, \u0026ldquo;now these three remain: faith, hope and love\u0026rdquo; (1Cor 13:13). Hope is a vision of a desirable but not yet obtained future:\n\u0026ldquo;For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 8:24-25)\nHope always relates to future things, and often refers to uncertain things, such as when Paul says, \u0026ldquo;I hope to visit you.\u0026rdquo; However, there is a special kind of hope in the bible; a sure and certain hope. It is the assured hope of one day receiving all that we have inherited in Christ. It is part of the gospel message and is inspired by the Holy Spirit:\nWe have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain. (Heb 6:19)\nMay the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. (Rom 15:13)\nFaith has similarities with hope because it also relates to a desirable but not yet visible future, but hope is not faith. A Christian may know that the bible teaches the assured hope of resurrection yet may not have assurance for themselves. They may have hope but not faith. Faith adds certainty to that hope:\n\u0026ldquo;Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.\u0026rdquo; (Heb 11:1)\nFaith, therefore, adds assurance or certainty to hope. In the context of prayer, faith has an even more specific role: it adds present certainty. In prayer, faith takes a future hope and makes it a present reality.\nanyone \u0026hellip; who believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. \u0026hellip;whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 11:23-24)\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;if you have faith and do not doubt \u0026hellip; it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 21:21-22)\n\u0026ldquo;If you have faith as small as a mustard seed\u0026hellip; it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u0026quot;(Matt 17:20)\nJesus said that He would answer the prayer of faith, not the prayer of hope. There is no assurance that we will receive answers to our hopes in prayer. \u0026ldquo;Jesus I ask you to do such and such because I really need help here\u0026rdquo; is a prayer of hope not faith. A vision of a desirable future is presented to God in this prayer, but that is not how Jesus instructed us to pray. He said, \u0026ldquo;Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.\u0026quot; Faith says, \u0026ldquo;I am sure and certain of what I hope for. Jesus has heard and granted my request. I have my answer.\u0026rdquo;\nSalvation is by faith, not hope (Eph 2:8). This is well understood. A person hoping for salvation would be urged to put their faith in Christ, so that they could stop hoping and make it real. Faith is the realisation of things hoped for. We should approach prayer in exactly the same way. Hoping God will answer your prayer is not faith. Faith is knowing God has answered. Prayer is answered in response to faith, not hope.\nDenial is not faith Although faith looks at unseen evidence, it does not deny our experienced reality. Faith does not deny that symptoms are real, that pain is real, that sin is real or that the devil is real. When Jesus asked the blind man if he could see, he wanted a report of the experienced facts, not a \u0026ldquo;confession of faith\u0026rdquo;:\nWhen he had spat on the man\u0026rsquo;s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, \u0026quot;Do you see anything?\u0026quot; He looked up and said, \u0026quot;I see people; they look like trees walking around.\u0026quot; (Mk 8:23)\nIt is interesting to note the way Jesus asked his question. He could have made a \u0026ldquo;faith confession\u0026rdquo; by asking, \u0026ldquo;What can you see?\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;Can you see anything?\u0026rdquo; But it seems Jesus was not bothered by such detail. However, the blind man\u0026rsquo;s experience was a challenge to Jesus' faith because he could not see clearly. The disciples might have given up, but Jesus ministered healing again. Faith does not deny experienced reality but neither does it allow those experiences to hold our attention.\n\u0026ldquo;Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\u0026rdquo; (Heb 12:2)\nAbraham is held up as our example of faith:\n\u0026ldquo;He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed\u0026mdash;the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were. Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, \u0026quot;So shall your offspring be.\u0026quot; Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead\u0026mdash;since he was about a hundred years old\u0026mdash;and that Sarah\u0026rsquo;s womb was also dead. Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 4:17-21)\nAbraham is an example of faith precisely because he hoped against all hope. Abraham didn\u0026rsquo;t deny the fact but \u0026ldquo;faced the fact\u0026rdquo; that present reality did not match the promise he was believing. It is not unbelief or \u0026ldquo;negative confession\u0026rdquo; to say, \u0026ldquo;No. I am not yet healed. I still have the pain.\u0026rdquo; But it is unbelief to say, \u0026ldquo;God has not granted my healing\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the prayer didn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rdquo;. Faith does not consider the problem, but considers Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12:2). We grow strong in our faith as we give glory to God, not as we give attention and \u0026lsquo;glory\u0026rsquo; to our as yet unresolved problem.\nRather than giving attention to the problem, focus your mind on what Jesus has done for you and what He is doing for you as your High Priest. Jesus is doing something for you right now. He is seated at the right hand of God right now making intercession for you (Heb. 7:25).\n\u0026ldquo;Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.\u0026rdquo; (Heb 4:14)\n\u0026ldquo;My son, pay attention to what I say; listen closely to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and health to a man\u0026rsquo;s whole body.\u0026rdquo; (Prov 4:20-22)\n\u0026ldquo;The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 6:63)\nFaith keeps God\u0026rsquo;s life-giving words in our thoughts and lets them hold our attention. God has given us His Word to get our thinking straightened out, so that we won\u0026rsquo;t be ignorant and so our believing will be right.\n\u0026ldquo;So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.\u0026rdquo; (Eph 4:17-18)\nGod has said, \u0026ldquo;Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.\u0026rdquo; So we say with confidence, \u0026ldquo;The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?\u0026rdquo; (Heb 13:5-6)\nIs it God\u0026rsquo;s will? \u0026ldquo;Ah!\u0026rdquo; someone will say, \u0026ldquo;But what if it isn\u0026rsquo;t God\u0026rsquo;s will for you to have what you ask for.\u0026rdquo; To which I answer, somewhat simplistically, \u0026ldquo;But in my bible, I have it written that Jesus said it was God\u0026rsquo;s will to do whatever we ask in believing prayer. So why don\u0026rsquo;t you concentrate on doing what Jesus said, and let God worry about His part of the bargain?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ask and it will be given to you; For everyone who asks receives;\u0026rdquo; (Matt 7:7-8) (this sentiment is repeated six times by Jesus in this passage, and it is also recorded by Luke).\n\u0026ldquo;If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!\u0026rdquo; (Matt 7:11)\nHe replied, \u0026ldquo;Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, \u0026lsquo;Move from here to there\u0026rsquo; and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 17:20)\n\u0026ldquo;Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.\u0026rdquo; (Mt 18:19)\nJesus replied, \u0026ldquo;I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig-tree, but also you can say to this mountain, \u0026lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,\u0026rsquo; and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.\u0026rdquo; (Matt 21:21-22)\n\u0026ldquo;Everything is possible for him who believes\u0026hellip; I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, \u0026lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,\u0026rsquo; and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 11:22-24)\n\u0026ldquo;And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. (Jn 14:13-14)\n\u0026ldquo;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 15:7)\n\u0026ldquo;The Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.\u0026rdquo; (Jn 15:16)\n\u0026ldquo;In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.\u0026rdquo; (Joh 16:23-24)\nJesus does not seem to be the least bit worried about what we might ask for. Any one of the many recorded encouragements to ask could have been qualified with \u0026ldquo;if it is God\u0026rsquo;s will\u0026rdquo;, but not a single such condition is found in the gospel record among nearly 30 such promises. Let us be honest. If a person says \u0026ldquo;But what if it isn\u0026rsquo;t God\u0026rsquo;s will for you to have what you ask for\u0026rdquo; then you can hope that they will take care to ask according to God\u0026rsquo;s will. I do not see asking for the wrong things as the main problem that Jesus encountered. As it happens, we do read of Jesus correcting someone who asked Him for something slightly dubious.\nThen the mother of Zebedee\u0026rsquo;s sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favour of him. \u0026ldquo;What is it you want?\u0026rdquo; he asked. She said, \u0026ldquo;Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t know what you are asking,\u0026rdquo; Jesus said to them. \u0026ldquo;Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;We can,\u0026rdquo; they answered. Jesus said to them, \u0026ldquo;You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.\u0026rdquo; When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. (Mt 20:20-24)\nNotice that although the disciples were indignant about this request, Jesus was not. There is not a hint of reprimand in Jesus' response. Indeed, He gives what He has the authority to give in meeting the request. Not once do we read of Jesus refusing a request or reprimanding someone for not asking in accordance with God\u0026rsquo;s will. The problem Jesus confronted was not presumptuous faith but no faith. Jesus did not say \u0026ldquo;When the Son of Man comes will he find people believing God for the wrong things\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;Will He find faith on earth\u0026rdquo; (Lk 18:8) So I say again. You concentrate on asking God in believing prayer and let God worry about fulfilling His promise to grant your request.\nIt is evident that the apostles felt the need to add some qualification to these promises:\n\u0026ldquo;Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him.\u0026rdquo; (1Jo 3:21-22)\n\u0026ldquo;This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us\u0026mdash;whatever we ask\u0026mdash;we know that we have what we asked of him.\u0026rdquo; (1Jo 5:14-15)\n\u0026ldquo;Yet you do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures.\u0026rdquo; (Jas 4:2-3)\n\u0026ldquo;The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.\u0026rdquo; (Jas 5:16)\n\u0026ldquo;Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.\u0026rdquo; (1Pe 3:7)\nClearly a spirit filled believer who believes Jesus and takes His word seriously is never going to knowingly ask for something contrary to God\u0026rsquo;s will. We can confidently come to God in faith-filled prayer for the abundance of His good gifts which the Father promises to give to those who ask him. The issue is not God\u0026rsquo;s will, but our asking.\nOn the occasions when we really do not know what God\u0026rsquo;s will is, we can confidently use Jesus\u0026rsquo;s words from Gethsemane, \u0026ldquo;Not my will but yours be done.\u0026rdquo; But when praying in accordance with God\u0026rsquo;s declared will we do not need to use such words. We should pray single-mindedly for the result confident in Jesus' many promises to grant our requests.\nPart 4 - Putting faith to work Receiving the Spirit As we have seen, God answers our prayers of faith. Faith says, \u0026ldquo;I have got what I asked for\u0026rdquo; and confesses the fact even before seeing the reality of the answer. The same is true when it comes to receiving the Holy Spirit. We have a promise backed up by a fact:\n\u0026ldquo;God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.\u0026rdquo; (Ac 2:32-33)\nWhen praying for the gift of the Holy Spirit, we do not need to ask God to give. We are not dependant on a promise but a fact; that God has poured out His Spirit for believers. We see this in Acts where believers were not asked \u0026lsquo;has God given you the Spirit?\u0026rsquo; but \u0026lsquo;have you received the Spirit?\u0026rsquo; It is up to us to receive:\nHe asked them, \u0026ldquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\u0026rdquo; They answered, \u0026ldquo;No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\u0026rdquo; (Ac 19:2)\nGod has given the Spirit, we must receive Him by faith, just as we receive salvation by faith. Then we must act on our faith by speaking in tongues. The Spirit does not speak in tongues, we do, as the Spirit prompts.\n\u0026ldquo;All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.\u0026rdquo; (Ac 2:4)\n\u0026ldquo;The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. (Ac 10:45-46)\n\u0026ldquo;When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.\u0026rdquo; (Ac 19:6)\nSo here also we see that faith must be accompanied by action. Speaking in tongues is how we demonstrate our faith in God\u0026rsquo;s promise to give the Spirit. If we act in demonstration of our faith by speaking in tongues, then God will give us \u0026ldquo;utterance\u0026rdquo;.\nHaving been filled with the Holy Spirit, we also, like Stephen, need to be filled with faith and power, then we will be able to obey Jesus' command to preach the Gospel with confirming signs and wonders:\n\u0026ldquo;Now Stephen, a man full of God\u0026rsquo;s grace and power, did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people.\u0026rdquo; (Ac 6:8)\nFaith without works is dead James says that faith without works is dead.\n\u0026ldquo;What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?\u0026rdquo; (Jas 2:14)\n\u0026ldquo;But someone will say, \u0026ldquo;You have faith; I have deeds.\u0026rdquo; Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that\u0026mdash;and shudder. You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless? Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did.\u0026rdquo; (Jas 2:18-22)\nJames is principally talking about evidence of faith in our moral behaviour. But he takes Abraham offering Isaac as an example and thus shows that the principal has a wider application. Like Abraham, we must confess and act on our faith before we receive evidence. If you want to wait for evidence before you confess it, you\u0026rsquo;re wrong. You\u0026rsquo;ve got the cart before the horse. You\u0026rsquo;ll never inherit the promises that way. You have to believe the promises in God\u0026rsquo;s Word are true for you, confess them for yourself; then you possess them.\nBut what does it say? \u0026ldquo;The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,\u0026rdquo; that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: That if you confess with your mouth, \u0026ldquo;Jesus is Lord,\u0026rdquo; and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved (Rom 10:8-10).\nThus we see that the speaking out about one\u0026rsquo;s salvation is a required part of receiving salvation. Confession in the heart to God is not enough. Public confession is part of the package. The same is true of any other prayer of faith:\nIt is written: \u0026ldquo;I believed; therefore I have spoken.\u0026rdquo; With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak (2Cor 4:13).\nNowhere in the bible do we ever find faith receiving its answer without action. Heart faith is not enough. It must be expressed somehow, either by a physical act or through a spoken word and with thanksgiving to God. If you cannot demonstrate your faith by action, you should confess it to other people. It needs to go beyond the secrecy of you and God. It is not that speaking it releases some magic but that hope is so easily mistaken for faith. Acting on our faith or telling another person what we have obtained by faith helps to reveal our true faith.\n\u0026ldquo;Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.\u0026rdquo; (Mt 10:32-33)\n\u0026ldquo;Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.\u0026rdquo; (Mt 7:24)\nFaith without works is dead! Action without faith will fail, and faith without action will fail. The people believed and shouted before the walls of Jericho came down (Josh 6:20). Shouting afterwards is easy! Faith does so before it sees. If you don\u0026rsquo;t act, you did not have faith. Or put positively, if you have faith, you will act. Who would not act if they knew they had received their request? Give thanks after your prayer and before you see the evidence of the answer:\n\u0026ldquo;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\u0026rdquo; (Php 4:6-7)\nJesus said something which seems very unfair:\n\u0026ldquo;Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.\u0026rdquo; (Mt 13:12)\nJesus said this because it is true. It is how faith works. Faith begets faith, doubt begets doubt. What you sow you reap. Those who have faith will get more, but those who doubt will lose what little faith they have. Whenever the storms of sickness or other challenge come along, one standing on the word of God will overcome and be strengthened in their faith, whilst the one who hears but does not truly believe and confess them will be overcome and what little faith they had will be lost. The only way to increase faith is to act on the faith you already have.\nThe Fight of Faith Faith comes through our study of the word and through hearing sound teaching. It is likely to be contested by circumstance and physical evidence, in which case we must fight the fight of faith. We insist on the truth of the word and deny the authority of any contrary evidence, acting on and speaking the truth, not the lie. We must hold fast the confession of our faith.\n\u0026ldquo;Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.\u0026rdquo; (Heb 10:23)\n\u0026ldquo;Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses.\u0026rdquo; (1Ti 6:12)\nThe fight of faith takes place in our spirits and minds. All kinds of \u0026lsquo;reasonable\u0026rsquo; arguments arise in our minds saying that we do not have what God promised, that our prayer has not been answered, that Satan has prevailed over us. We have to take every such thought captive and declare instead the truth of Christ.\n\u0026ldquo;The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.\u0026rdquo; (2Co 10:4-5)\nThere is an American proverb: \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t keep the birds from flying over your head, but you can keep them from building a nest in your hair!\u0026rdquo; You can refuse to dwell on Satan\u0026rsquo;s accusations. You can also refuse to put evil thoughts into action. The best thing to do is to laugh at the devil because he is a liar. Cultivate the habit of thinking big things according to the Word and acting out your faith.\n\u0026ldquo;Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\u0026rdquo; (Jas 4:7)\n\u0026ldquo;Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.\u0026rdquo; (Jas 1:22)\nRefuse fear and anxiety which undermine faith. Don\u0026rsquo;t think about negative things, even if they are true! Think about the good truth of God\u0026rsquo;s word and rejoice in that.\n\u0026ldquo;Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable\u0026mdash;if anything is excellent or praiseworthy\u0026mdash;think about such things.\u0026rdquo; (Phil 4:8)\nIn the face of trials, we should turn the tables on Satan, rejoicing in the fact that trials serve to strengthen our faith, not undermine it.\n\u0026ldquo;Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.\u0026rdquo; (Jas 1:2-8)\nThe weapons and armour of our warfare are faith in God and in His word. Memorising scripture is one of our best defences, allowing us to recall truth whenever we face attack.\n\u0026ldquo;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armour of God so that you can take your stand against the devil\u0026rsquo;s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armour of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled round your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.\u0026rdquo; (Eph 6:10-18)\nSo let us be bold in our counter attack against the lies of Satan.\n\u0026ldquo;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me\u0026rdquo; (Phil. 4:13)\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD is my light and my salvation\u0026mdash;whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life\u0026mdash;of whom shall I be afraid?\u0026rdquo; (Ps 27:1)\nAs the Scripture says, \u0026ldquo;Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 10:11)\nChristians are often very quickly offended if they hear another Christian swear, but don\u0026rsquo;t even seem to notice when they speak words of doubt and unbelief . I think the Gospels show us that Jesus would consider speaking words of doubt and unbelief to be an offence far worse than swearing! Doubt and fear come from the devil and we should have nothing to do with them. We must stand against them with God\u0026rsquo;s word.\nWalking in victory Our inheritance in Jesus is not sickness and defeat but resurrection victory:\n\u0026ldquo;For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,\u0026rdquo; (Col 1:13)\nWe should be careful not to \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; what is not ours; not to speak of troubles as if they were ours, but rather as impostors with no right of abode or access. We should not endlessly confess our sin and failures but confess God\u0026rsquo;s total forgiveness and grace. Let us confess our righteousness in His sight because of Jesus. Neither should we confess our sickness, but rather our inheritance of healing in Christ. If only we believed that almighty God is IN US! What victory we would walk in.\n\u0026ldquo;But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 15:57)\n\u0026ldquo;For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God\u0026rsquo;s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 5:17)\n\u0026ldquo;You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.\u0026rdquo; (1Jo 4:4)\nGod has given promises to strengthen us against fear, which is so often Satan\u0026rsquo;s weapon against us.\n\u0026ldquo;So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.\u0026rdquo; (Isa 41:10)\n\u0026ldquo;What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?\u0026rdquo; (Rom 8:31)\nHowever it is important to recognise that the Holy Spirit is our helper, not our doer. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t force himself upon us, but prompts and encourages and empowers our actions. We must be willing and courageous and act in the faith that God will empower us.\nFinally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. (Eph 6:10)\n\u0026ldquo;Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.\u0026rdquo; So we say with confidence, \u0026ldquo;The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?\u0026rdquo; (Heb 13:5-6)\n\u0026ldquo;I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.\u0026rdquo; (Eph 3:16-17)\n\u0026ldquo;I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\u0026rdquo; (Joh 16:33)\nWe may suffer many troubles in this life because of hostility to God, but in our spirits, souls and bodies we can walk in victory. Victory over sin, sickness and fear comes through faith as we believe and act in demonstration of our confidence in God.\nMany people who receive divine healing get sick again with the same sickness. Their healing does not persist. Jesus spoke about this:\nWhen an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, \u0026lsquo;I will return to the house I left.\u0026rsquo; When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first. (Lu 11:24-26)\nThe reason a Christian gets sick in the first place is because of an illegal intrusion of the devil. Healing prayer can drive out the sickness, but if that person does not close the door to re-invasion by maintaining their confidence in God\u0026rsquo;s promises, then Satan can easily re-establish his former position. This is a serious problem because it undermines faith for future healing. It is therefore essential that healing is followed by repentance, the infilling of the Holy Spirit and instruction on spiritual warfare. When Jesus healed He frequently said, \u0026ldquo;Go and sin no more\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.\u0026rdquo; (1Jo 4:4)\nThis simple scripture can help to strengthen a person\u0026rsquo;s faith against re-infection. If any symptoms reappear, we can declare, \u0026ldquo;God is in me! There is no room for the devil as well.\u0026rdquo; And so kick him out!\nFaith brings peace Fellowship with Jesus is the mother of faith and joy. It is the source of victory.\n\u0026ldquo;Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\u0026rdquo; (Joh 8:32)\n\u0026ldquo;I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.\u0026rdquo; (Joh 15:11)\n\u0026ldquo;God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.\u0026rdquo; (1Co 1:9)\nFaith brings us to a place of rest in believing. It is not an inner struggle. We may have to fight the devils accusations and other peoples doubts, but faith is assurance, and assurance, by definition, brings peace.\n\u0026ldquo;The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace;\u0026rdquo; (Ro 8:6)\n\u0026ldquo;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.\u0026rdquo; (Ro 15:13)\n\u0026ldquo;Now we who have believed enter that rest\u0026rdquo; (Heb 4:3)\n\u0026ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,\u0026rdquo; (Ro 14:17)\nHe said to her, \u0026ldquo;Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\u0026rdquo; (Mr 5:34)\n\u0026ldquo;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\u0026rdquo; (Phil 4:6-7)\nFaith is evidenced by peace and joy in our hearts. If our hearts do not condemn us, we receive whatever we ask:\nDear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him. (1Jn 3:20-21)\nEmulating Abraham As we have already seen, Abraham is held up as our example of faith. He put into practice the things we have learnt in this study:\n\u0026ldquo;He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed\u0026mdash;the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were. Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, \u0026quot;So shall your offspring be.\u0026quot; Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead\u0026mdash;since he was about a hundred years old\u0026mdash;and that Sarah\u0026rsquo;s womb was also dead. Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.\u0026rdquo; (Rom 4:17-21)\nCan you see how he took the following steps that we have looked at:\n  Faith is Fact: Consider God\u0026rsquo;s statements of fact upon which your faith is based.\n  Believe God\u0026rsquo;s word.\n  Faith precedes sight: Call things that are not as though they were (i.e. ignore the contradictory evidence)\n  Give glory to God for His answer.\n  The healing of the woman with a flow of blood is another example of faith in action. It is particularly instructive because the healing took place without Jesus Himself taking any action. In that respect, it is similar to our own healing. We take action to obtain healing because we know what Jesus has already done for us:\n\u0026ldquo;And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, because she thought, \u0026ldquo;If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.\u0026rdquo; Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. At once Jesus realised that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, \u0026ldquo;Who touched my clothes?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You see the people crowding against you,\u0026rdquo; his disciples answered, \u0026ldquo;and yet you can ask, \u0026lsquo;Who touched me?'\u0026rdquo; But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.\u0026rdquo; (Mk 5:25-33)\nWe see the same steps in her obtaining healing:\n  Her faith was based on fact: She had heard about Jesus healing.\n  She believed He would heal her. (\u0026ldquo;I will be healed\u0026rdquo;)\n  She acted on her faith. (She touched His cloak)\n  She gave glory to God for His answer (She told him the whole truth)\n  This is the pattern of faith that gains victory over the flesh, the world, and the devil:\nFacts-\u0026gt;Faith-\u0026gt;Action-\u0026gt;Evidence\nThere are many other examples of this pattern of faith. It is how David slaughtered Goliath, Joshua defeated Jericho and the prodigal son was received back by his father.\nA Model Prayer for healing I am very hesitant about offering a model prayer for healing knowing how susceptible we are to thinking that if we get the words right, God will answer. But the following account of a prayer made by an elderly missionary is, I think, quite instructive.\n\u0026ldquo;Father, this woman is Your child. She belongs to you. It is not right that the devil should dominate her through sickness and disease. So we thank You, Father, because You have made provision for her deliverance. You laid her sickness and her diseases on Jesus, for it is written, \u0026lsquo;He took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Then this retired missionary exercised his authority over the devil based on the Word of God. He said, \u0026ldquo;Now, Satan, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to take your hands off this woman\u0026rsquo;s body because this body is a temple of the Holy Ghost. It belongs to God and you\u0026rsquo;ve got no right to trespass on God\u0026rsquo;s property. Now we demand that you remove yourself from God\u0026rsquo;s property.\u0026rdquo; Then the retired missionary talked to the woman. He said, \u0026ldquo;Now, Sister, Satan has oppressed your body with sickness, but God has made provision for your deliverance. Your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost, and you are commanded to glorify God in your body and in your spirit. Can God be glorified in your body by the devil dominating it? No, therefore, you stand against this sickness with me, and together we will demand that Satan stop trespassing on God\u0026rsquo;s property.\u0026rdquo;\nThe three parties involved in sickness and healing, God, Satan and the sick person, are addressed with simple confident faith in accordance with God\u0026rsquo;s word. This is not a formula, but an example of a prayer of faith which is in line with Jesus own ministry.\n  Paul acknowledges that we experience present suffering with Christ because of the wickedness of the fallen world we live in and we wait patiently for the fullness of redemption, when we will receive renewed bodies (see 1Cor 15:35ff for Pauls teaching about resurrection bodies). For this he says \u0026ldquo;we hope for what we do not yet have.\u0026rdquo; But note that it is specifically the final resurrection redemption of our bodies which we do not yet have. Paul certainly did not believe we have to wait for healing. He practiced healing as an essential part of proclaiming and demonstrating the gospel (Ro 15:18-19). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0d30230167c9f7f50c792f9526e583da","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/faith/walking-in-faith/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/faith/walking-in-faith/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"Walking In Faith  Stephen Dolley February 2013 Contents Introduction 3\nPrayers of faith please God 4\nPart 1 - The Authentic Gospel 7\nThe power of the gospel in a challenging context 7","tags":null,"title":"Walking in Faith","type":"document"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"What Christ has done for us Get the youth to act this story out:  Rev 12:7-12 Then war broke out in heaven.

CS Lewis distinguishes between giving-love and need-love; we love God because we need Him, but He loves us out of giving rather than need. He also distinguishes between need-pleasure and appreciative-pleasure. We enjoy a glass of water only when we are thirsty (need-pleasure) but we enjoy the scent of a flower without having a need to smell flowers. Need-pleasures are self-centred and passing (my need was met), whereas appreciation pleasures are object-centred and enduring (that is beautiful). These pleasures naturally lead to expressions of love, we love those things that meet our needs, and we love those things whose beauty delights us.\nI define giving-love as having a concern for, and taking delight in the wellbeing and joy of another. It is a love that gives us pleasure, or it is not love at all, but that pleasure is indirect. For instance I spent an evening listening to Stravinsky\u0026rsquo;s Firebird with an elderly friend. His wife said she wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in that sort of music and said she would come and pick him up later . When she came to pick him up, I said to her, \u0026ldquo;Ruth, just listen to the first few bars of this music\u0026rdquo;. She humoured us and sat down. 20 minutes later she sat in silent spellbound wonder. I had already enjoyed the music myself that evening, but it gave me enormous added pleasure to see how much Ruth was moved by it. That pleasure was itself two-fold. Partly I was pleased because I love the music and feel it deserves peoples appreciation, but my greater pleasure was because I loved Ruth and was so thrilled to see her evident wonder and enjoyment.\nNeed-love is easy to understand \u0026ndash; I love Mirrlees because she cooks nice meals for me. Appreciative love is slightly more difficult; why should I love the smell of sweet-peas? Well, I don\u0026rsquo;t know but the appreciation of beauty enriches our lives. And so I also love Mirrlees because of her qualities that I appreciate, such as her kindness. Both of these loves are real and important and valid, but they are selfish; neither are giving-loves. The test of giving love is \u0026ldquo;do I delight in Mirrlees' pleasure?\u0026rdquo;\nThis is important for our receiving God\u0026rsquo;s love. His love is not need-love. He does not need worshippers. God does not need us to reassure Him that He is the almighty.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s love is giving-love. As Paul says to the Romans, **^ \u0026ldquo;^**He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all\u0026mdash;how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?\u0026rdquo; God loves us to know His forgiveness and be free from guilt and shame and fear. He loves to see our lives free from the corrupting effects of lies and deceit. **\u0026quot;**It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.\u0026quot;\nGod loves our wellbeing; He loves our joy. Paul urges the Corinthian\u0026rsquo;s not to receive God\u0026rsquo;s grace in vain. There is a temptation to believe that even after we have come to God in repentance for forgiveness, that we still owe Him a debt of remorse and self-loathing. Yet when someone has seriously wronged us and then comes in grovelling remorse it is most irritating if they will not simply accept our forgiveness and move on. To keep begging for forgiveness is tantamount to saying \u0026ldquo;I do not believe you have forgiven me.\u0026rdquo; It is an insult to our integrity and our ability to forgive. This is one aspect of receiving God\u0026rsquo;s grace in vain.\nPaul lived with the knowledge that he had actively persecuted Christ\u0026rsquo;s brothers, having them arrested and thrown into prison, bringing terror and misery to countless innocent families. He participated in the murder of Stephen and perhaps in the death of other believers. He was arrested by Jesus Himself and convicted of his sin against God and His people. When Judas realised how he had sinned against Jesus, he went and hung himself; but Paul became a passionate advocate for the gospel. Was Judas beyond forgiveness? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. Jesus forgave those who nailed Him to the cross. Although Paul was keenly aware that he had once been an enemy of God, he was clearly not preoccupied with that thought. He had received forgiveness from God, and that set Him free from the paralysing feelings of guilt and shame. No doubt from time to time he did or said things he later regretted and needed to receive further forgiveness from God. But Paul clearly lived with a clear conscience, untroubled by his previous sins and failings \u0026ndash; and not because he didn\u0026rsquo;t care about them, but because He received the grace of God in forgiveness. Paul\u0026rsquo;s appeal to the Corinthians was that they should not receive the grace of God in vain. Have we learnt to fully receive God\u0026rsquo;s love and forgiveness? Do we live with guilt and shame for past failings that continue to plague our thoughts? The gracious forgiveness of God has been demonstrated on the cross and promised to us in scripture, but is received by faith.\nIt is not always easy to receive God\u0026rsquo;s forgiveness; sometimes we cannot truly believe God has totally forgiven us and that he does not want us to carry a burden of guilt. ...\nWhat motivated Paul to withstand such difficulties in ministry?\nIn the course of pursuing some great goal many people endure incredible hardship. Mountaineers and polar explorers for example. Most of us have endure hardship of some sort for the prospect of future gain \u0026ndash; studying for exams for example. Or scrimping and saving to get together the money for a deposit on our first home. Paul describes some of the hardships he has endured for the sake of his ministry, \u0026ldquo;so that our ministry will not be discredited\u0026rdquo; he says.\nPaul is motivated by two loves; firstly an appreciation for the Love of God; the desire to see as many people as possible share in that appreciation because God\u0026rsquo;s love is so beautiful. And secondly his love for people. Paul loved the Corinthians as his own children. He loved their wellbeing and joy, and knew that Jesus was the true means to the greatest joys. He is not driven by need-love. Paul does not need the adulation of men; far from it! He rebukes those who seek to please men rather than God.\nOur own relationship with God is firstly and primarily one of need-love. We need His love and forgiveness. We need His assurances and care. We are children in need of His care. Many Psalms are written from this perspective, crying out for God\u0026rsquo;s deliverance.\nBut as we get to know Him we begin to appreciate Him for who He is. We love His faithfulness, we delight in His righteousness, we wonder at His glory. The more we appreciate Him the more we will want to make Him known. This leads us to delight in worshipping Him, singing songs that exalt His wondrous qualities. We see this appreciative love expressed in many of the Psalms.\nBut neither our need of God nor our appreciation of His qualities necessitates a personal relationship with God; one in which giving love is a two-way experience. Although God has no need of us, we can nevertheless give Him pleasure. The scriptures tell us again and again that God takes pleasure in the righteous, in those who put their trust in Him, in those who take risks of faith in Him. He has no pleasure in those who shrink back in fear. We can please God through our trust in Him, and we can take delight in God\u0026rsquo;s pleasure. These things are the essence of a personal relationship with God. It goes beyond simple need and appreciation and includes a joyful motivation to give God pleasure.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"aa4f096aa4d47e817f347215ef977348","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/love/what-is-love/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching-materials/love/what-is-love/","section":"Teaching Materials","summary":"What is love?
