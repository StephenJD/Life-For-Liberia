      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-communion-prayer&#34;&gt;A Communion Prayer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Composed by Fr Brian shortly before he died)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord I come now before you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the weakness that has overcome me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the feelings I cannot share and try to hide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the emptiness that sometimes grips me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with the physical and mental pain that so often preoccupies me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also come in faith and trust, in humility and reverence,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I ask to be relieved and healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You took human weakness on yourself when you lived,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffered and died for our sake,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You manifested your victory over all human weakness,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over all negatives that tend to break us,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And over death itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that our trust in you is deepened,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can overcome the negative feelings we experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I present myself to you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that you love me just as I am,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But knowing also that your will is my happiness,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that you can bring this about in ways,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That I will not be able to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help me this day not to be undermined by illness,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pain or problems that beset me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask this not for myself but for the sake of all those whose lives I
touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen. .&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Author. &lt;a href=&#34;http://thinktheology.co.uk/theology/contributors/21&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Andrew
Wilson]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; |
Publication Date. 31/10/2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I believe in apostles today. I affirm the uniqueness of the Apostles
(capital A) who witnessed the risen Jesus &amp;ndash; the twelve, Paul, James,
and possibly one or two others &amp;ndash; and of course affirm that nobody today
can write Scripture. But I also affirm that there were apostles (lower
case a) who, like Apollos and a number of others, had an apostolic gift
and ministry without having seen the risen Jesus for themselves (compare
1 Cor 4:1-13 with Acts 18:24-28). Since I don&amp;rsquo;t see any exegetical
reason to suppose this type of ministry ceased in the first generation,
I am led to expect apostles (as opposed to Apostles) continuing today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, however, that the vast majority of references to
A/apostles and A/apostolic ministry involve Apostles (primarily Paul,
Peter, James and John), as opposed to apostles (like Apollos, Barnabas,
probably Silas, and possibly Timothy). So, if we are looking for
guidance as to how apostles should function today, we face an exegetical
challenge. When Paul is speaking about his own ministry, how can we tell
whether he is speaking as an Apostle or an apostle? Following on from
this, how can we tell whether modern day apostles can, or should,
appropriate Paul&amp;rsquo;s words to refer to their own ministries? For example:&lt;br&gt;
\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should we expect modern day apostles to be present in spirit when
church discipline is conducted in a local church (1 Cor 5:4; cf. 1 Tim
1:20)?\&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it appropriate for modern day apostles to define their gospel,
along the lines of Paul&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;my gospel&amp;rdquo; (Rom 2:16; 16:25; 2 Tim 2:8), and
to charge those who disagree with them not to teach otherwise (1 Tim 1:3
et al)?\&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should modern apostolic ministry involve going to unreached people
groups (Rom 15:8-21)? Is it sub-apostolic if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t?\&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ought modern apostles and prophets to see themselves as the
foundation of the church (Eph 2:20; cf. Eph 3:4-5), and live and serve
accordingly?\&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are modern apostles responsible for laying foundations in churches,
accountable directly to God for their labour, and authenticated in their
ministry by vilification and suffering (1 Cor 3:1-4:13; 2 Cor 6:3-10)?\&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can modern apostles command individuals to do them personal favours
(Phm 8)?\&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can a modern apostle speak directly to a local church to correct
inaccurate theology, without going through the elders (Galatians, 1
Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Colossians, etc)?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Much of this, and certainly 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7, relates to the question of
apostolic authority, which is an important issue for those of us who
believe in apostles today. Paul, as an Apostle, clearly had Apostolic
authority to define the gospel (#2), establish theological,
ecclesiological and kerygmatic foundations (#4) and ensure they were
preserved (#7), instruct individual believers (#6) and discipline the
church if necessary (#1), with or without the agreement of the local
church elders. But what about modern apostles? Do they have apostolic
authority in the same sense? And if not, how does it work?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The whole topic has massive practical implications. Were someone to
answer positively to all seven of these questions, they would
effectively be blurring altogether the line between Apostles and
apostles; even if they were to maintain that modern apostles could not
write the Bible, they would nonetheless be arguing for almost
unchallenged authority for modern apostles, with the apostle&amp;rsquo;s
interpretation of Scripture the defining source of doctrine amongst the
churches for which he was responsible. On the other hand, if someone
were to answer negatively to all seven, then the case for there being
such a thing as a modern apostle in the first place would practically
disappear; if an apostle does not do any of the above things, then it is
hard to see how they are any different from an itinerant evangelist or
church planter. It&amp;rsquo;s not straightforward.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Despite the implications, however, the issue has not always been
thoroughly thought through. (Have compassion on people learning English,
by the way: that&amp;rsquo;s three consecutive words with &amp;ldquo;ough&amp;rdquo; in them,
pronounced differently each time.) Many books on apostles today have
commandeered every reference to an &lt;em&gt;apostolos&lt;/em&gt; in the New Testament,
without making clear on what basis they believe each text should be
applied to contemporary apostles. Other writers, more sceptical of
apostolic ministry today, have dismissed all descriptions of New
Testament apostleship as being unique to the first century. Meanwhile,
many thoughtful practitioners, including Terry Virgo, David Devenish,
and others in the Newfrontiers family, have lived out an exemplary
middle ground between these two extremes &amp;ndash; but an exegetical and
hermeneutical explanation of which texts apply directly to apostles
today and which texts don&amp;rsquo;t, and of how we may establish the nature and
limits of apostolic authority today, has not yet (to my knowledge) been
provided. Hence this post.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I propose the following starting point for the conversation. There are
several texts in the New Testament in which it is clear that apostles
are in view, and not just Apostles, because they contain references to
those who did not witness the risen Christ. 1 Corinthians 3:5-4:13 is a
clear example, because it uses the phrase &amp;ldquo;us apostles&amp;rdquo; (4:8) of Paul
and Apollos. 1 Thessalonians 1-3 refers to Paul, Silvanus and Timothy as
&amp;ldquo;apostles of Christ&amp;rdquo; (2:6), which indicates that the things Paul says
about apostolic ministry in these chapters cannot be limited to
eyewitnesses of the resurrection (we have no evidence that
Silas/Silvanus witnessed the resurrection, and we know that Timothy was
not even converted until many years later). Paul&amp;rsquo;s extended discourse on
the ministry of the new covenant in 2 Corinthians 1-7 is almost entirely
spoken in the first person plural, including Timothy and possibly
Silvanus as well; although it does not use the word &amp;ldquo;apostles&amp;rdquo; in these
chapters, 3:1-3 strongly implies that Paul is thinking that way. And
although it is impossible to be certain, there are good reasons for
thinking that Barnabas did not witness the resurrection &amp;ndash; his
introduction in Acts 4:36 makes it very likely that he was not regarded
as an Apostle at this point &amp;ndash; but emerged as an apostle after being
sent out from Antioch (14:4, 14). This means that 1 Corinthians 9:4-14,
as well as the narrative passages about him in Acts (13:4-14:28), can
also be considered as applying to apostles, and not just Apostles. Taken
together, that is a substantial group of texts (Acts 13:4-14:28; 1 Cor
3:5-4:13; 9:4-14; 2 Cor 1-7; 1 Thess 1-3) that shed massive light on
what apostles who had not witnessed the resurrection did, and
consequently might be expected to do today.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now look at it the other way round. There are other passages in which it
seems clear, or at least likely, that Paul is speaking, not of apostolic
ministry in general, but of his (or, occasionally, others&#39;) unique
Apostolic ministry as eyewitness of the resurrected Christ, with the
corresponding role of instructing the church in the very foundations of
the gospel and Christian doctrine. So, in Galatians, Paul begins with an
affirmation that he did not receive the gospel from man but directly
from Jesus Christ (1:12), and this becomes the basis for an extended
tirade against the Galatians (who are called &amp;ldquo;foolish&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bewitched&amp;rdquo;),
false teachers (who are considered accursed and encouraged to castrate
themselves), and even the apostle Peter (who is spoken of more
courteously, but still said to have been &amp;ldquo;clearly in the wrong&amp;rdquo;). Paul&amp;rsquo;s
unique experience of receiving his gospel directly from Jesus gives him
licence to correct others in ways that Apollos and Silvanus, we may
assume, did not (and this surely also applies to his use of the phrase
&amp;ldquo;my gospel&amp;rdquo; in Romans and 2 Timothy). Similarly, in other texts, Paul
assumes that the Apostles had a unique role in salvation history: to
witness to the resurrection (1 Cor 15:1-11), and, along with the
prophets, to make plain the mystery of the gospel to the nations (Eph
3:1-6), which in context is probably what is meant by being the
foundation of the church (Eph 2:20). It is this conviction &amp;ndash; that Paul,
along with the other Apostles, has been entrusted with the gospel of God
by the risen Christ, and that it is to be preached and guarded at all
costs &amp;ndash; which prompts Paul to define the gospel in such detail in
Romans, and to urge its preservation with such vigour in the Pastoral
Epistles (1 Tim 1:11; 2:7; 6:13-16, 20-21; 2 Tim 1:8-14; 2:2, 8; Tit
1:1-3). I imagine no readers of this article will dispute that the
equivalent of this, in the church today, is the preservation of the
gospel and doctrines of the Apostles, in Scripture, not the gospel and
doctrines of a modern apostle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These two groups of texts &amp;ndash; the ones that unambiguously refer to
apostles in the broader sense, and the ones that unambiguously don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ndash;
actually represent a sizeable amount of the relevant New Testament
material on A/apostleship. In the first group, Paul, Apollos, Barnabas,
Silas and Timothy exercise authority out of their relationship in the
gospel; in the second group, Paul exercises authority based on his
revelation of the gospel. The difference is significant. In the former
case, it grows from a church&amp;rsquo;s voluntary submission to the apostle,
because the apostle has fathered the church by preaching and embodying
the gospel to the people. In the latter case, the authority transcends
gospel relationship: it is gospel revelation, and as such Paul&amp;rsquo;s gospel
is right, and the Judaizers&#39; gospel is wrong, whether they &amp;ldquo;receive his
Apostolic input&amp;rdquo; or not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
From here, I suggest, it is possible to make inferences about the
handful of remaining passages in the New Testament which shape our
theology of A/apostleship, but remain ambiguous with regard to whether
Paul is functioning as an Apostle or an apostle (e.g. Acts 20:17-38; 1
Cor 4:15-21; Rom 15:14-25; 2 Cor 10:1-18; 12:12; Eph 4:11-16). For what
it may be worth, I see Paul as speaking as an apostle in Acts 20 and 1
Corinthians 4 (because the passages are grounded in his relationship to
the church through gospel ministry), as well as in 2 Corinthians 10
(because of the plural pronouns, authorship and the reference back to
&amp;ldquo;letters of commendation&amp;rdquo; from chapter 3); I think Romans 15 is Paul
speaking with a specific ambition and vocation, which need not be
prescriptive for all A/apostles, then or now; and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about 2
Corinthians 12:12 or Ephesians 4:11-16. The upshot of all this is that,
if asked the seven questions I posed at the beginning, I would answer
&amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to #5 and #6, &amp;ldquo;sometimes&amp;rdquo; to #3, and &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to #1, #2, #4 and
#7. Just in case you were curious.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, in a nutshell: there are apostles today; they are different from
Apostles like Paul, James and Peter in a number of ways; they cannot
write Scripture; they do function with apostolic authority; but it is an
authority grounded in relationship through the gospel &amp;ndash; that is, seeing
disciples and churches come into being through their proclamation of the
gospel &amp;ndash; rather than the once-for-all revelation of the gospel which
came to Paul and the eyewitnesses to the resurrection.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And that means: even though we&amp;rsquo;ve got epistles, we still need apostles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent post Andrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not convinced that apostles don&amp;rsquo;t have the authority to correct bad
doctrine without going through the elders, if this is needed. It seems
that using Gal 1:12 only proves that Paul had a special revelation of
the Gospel in his Apostolic commission (this use of lower-case and
upper-case is hard to make consistent :P). However, Timothy, although
taking his cue from Paul, is commanded to rebuke and correct. I see no
suggestion that he has to go through the elders for this. I realise we
can argue that he is deriving his authority from Paul, but the fact is:
Timothy is an apostle, not an Apostle and he is simply told to rebuke;
not rebuke on behalf of Paul. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it a bit of an argument from silence
to say apostles have no authority to directly correct doctrine in local
churches, based on Gal 1:12?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Dan: Timothy was an elder, methinks (1 Tim 4:14; cf. 5:22, where the
meaning of &amp;ldquo;laying on of hands&amp;rdquo; is to do with eldership), and it is
certainly impossible to say he wasn&amp;rsquo;t, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think he works as an
example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Andrew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for posting on this - I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had any proper
teaching on the apostolic, so I&amp;rsquo;m probably a bit behind the curve on
this one&amp;hellip;but I&amp;rsquo;m a bit confused!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard others talk about the difference between Apostles and
apostles, but don&amp;rsquo;t know of an argument from Scripture as to why there&amp;rsquo;s
a difference&amp;hellip;is there one? Or is the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; simply a respectful nod to
the founding fathers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel its probably worth pointing out that David Devenish has recently
started a blog where he&amp;rsquo;s currently putting up some of his thoughts on
apostles today which you can find
here:&lt;a href=&#34;http://catalystnetwork.org/blog/tag/apostles/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[http://catalystnetwork.org/blog/tag/apostles/]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Sam: the main difference is that the twelve, Paul and James witnessed
the risen Christ and received their commission from him directly (Acts
1; 1 Cor 9:1-2; 15:1-11).&lt;br&gt;
@Graham: then you&amp;rsquo;ll be pleased to know that David is posting here on
the subject tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What evidence do we have from church history that the term apostle
continued to be used after the first Apostles died out? It would be very
interesting to see how the role of the apostle functioned during the
ante-nicene age and how the church fathers answered your seven
questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally I find the issue rather divisive. I don&amp;rsquo;t deny that there are
people with &amp;lsquo;apostolic giftings&amp;rsquo; today but you generally find they are
called bishops or overseers etc. The use of the term apostle is pretty
unhelpful and from my experience has led to a lot of confusion and
distracting arguments that seem to do more harm than good. It also
doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that there are many loons running around in
hyper-pentecostal / charismaniac circles claiming the title of Apostle
for themselves (New Apostolic Reformation anyone? Rev 2:2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Dave: Didache 11 is a good place to start. And the fact that something
is controversial or open to distortion should not stop us from teaching
it, surely, or else we&amp;rsquo;d have no trinity, hypostatic union, doctrines of
grace, communion, baptism, etc!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Andrew: Ok, what about Titus? He was charged to appoint elders and is
told to rebuke with &amp;ldquo;all authority&amp;rdquo; (2:15). If he&amp;rsquo;s not functioning as
an apostle (or apostolic delegate, but he still caries authority to
rebuke) I don&amp;rsquo;t know what we would call him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose a practical problem is that if apostles don&amp;rsquo;t have a God-given
right to come into church situations without consorting with the elders,
what happens when a church&amp;rsquo;s leadership falls into gross immorality and
refuses to have an apostle come to help? Practical rather than
theological I know, but it seems to fit in with Titus&#39; commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;rsquo;re stretching things saying timothy was an apostle why would
Paul seemingly exclude him in Col 1:1. Also why have apostles been
absent for the best part of church history? Would you have called Wesley
an apostle? Thanks for your thoughts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Dan: I agree Titus has that authority, but the whole point is that
there aren&amp;rsquo;t any elders there! Your practical question is more tricky,
though (although it would require all the elders to be in immorality,
which is hopefully exceedingly unlikely!)&lt;br&gt;
@Andrew: Timothy is the least certain, but I say it on the basis of 1
Thess 2; Apollos is absolutely clear, and Barnabas and Silas aren&amp;rsquo;t far
behind. As for church history: wouldn&amp;rsquo;t Luther have said the same about
justification by faith alone? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t the Anabaptists have said it
about believers baptism? Pentecostals about charismatic gifts? Church
history involves a lot of mistakes :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great thoughtful post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to pick up on the big A little a point a bit further. I too
admit to seeing no scriptural basis for the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think many modern day apostles would say they have received a
commission from Christ following a supernatural encounter rather than
feeling they have a knack for it. After all Christ gave apostles, he
didn&amp;rsquo;t give some people gifts, he gave some gifts (the apostles) to
people (the church). Sometimes we confuse the gifts Christ gave with the
gifts of the Holy Spirit which are different in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we follow this line of thought then we conclude there isn&amp;rsquo;t any
difference between Paul and say a modern day apostle (only that Paul
wrote significant chunks of the NT and modern apostles echo what Paul
first wrote). We need the modern day apostles to continue to build the
church up until maturity at which point Christ will stop giving us
apostles (as well as the rest of the Ephesians grace gifts)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that Timothy was not an apostle at the time when Paul was
writing Colossians but was by the time of 1 Thes which starts with
&amp;lsquo;Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; and then uses the plural we
throughout including in 2:6 &amp;lsquo;even though as apostles of Christ&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its seems to me that Paul is calling himself, Silas and Timothy all
apostles. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what the time difference between the
various letters are though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Josh: I don&amp;rsquo;t think that view does justice to the way Paul talks about
his apostolic commission in 1 Cor 9 or 15; Paul didn&amp;rsquo;t have a mere
supernatural experience, he actually saw the risen Christ.&lt;br&gt;
@Graham: no. Colossians is certainly written after 1 Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@andrew price: I think the church history question but is answered by
the lack of faithfulness to the gospel for long periods. You need the
gospel of grace in order to have apostles of the gospel of grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@Wilson: in your response to dave trigg&amp;rsquo;s complaint avout the use of
the &amp;ldquo;unhelpful term apostle&amp;rdquo; you say that just because somwthing is
controversial we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t avoid it, but in my experience churches (even
NF) largely avoid the terms &amp;ldquo;deacon&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bishop&amp;rdquo; but are happy with
&amp;ldquo;pastor&amp;rdquo; - surely we should be consistent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is an obvious tension when we describe apostolic ministry and
apostolic authority today. Some of the apostles of New Testament times
were forming what became recognised as the New Testament, and part of
Scripture. Modern apostles, by contrast, do not propose new apostolic
revelation; rather, they study, submit to and apply the apostolic
revelation already given in Scripture. Nevertheless, if we believe, as
we do, that apostolic ministry (in the sense lived out by Apollos,
Barnabas, Silas and co) continues today, then we still have to look at
the practices of New Testament apostles that we are familiar with in the
New Testament, to get some idea of what apostolic ministry is. Otherwise
we simply invent practices and call them apostolic. This approach
inevitably leads us to concentrate on Paul, even though we recognise
what was unique to his ministry and that of the twelve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew has written a stimulating and
thoughtful &lt;a href=&#34;http://whatyouthinkmatters.org/blog/article/apostolic-authority-how-does-it-work&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[article]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; on
how, biblically and practically, we work this all out. Despite agreeing
with large sections of it, however, there are a few points where I think
his view needs adjusting, and he has asked me to write and explain what
these are, and why I believe a better approach is possible, and in fact
necessary.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
In the first place, I am not sure that it is helpful to distinguish
between &amp;ldquo;Capital A&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;small a&amp;rdquo; apostles.  This has become a practice
within certain evangelical circles recently.  I find it particularly in
the &amp;ldquo;missions world&amp;rdquo; with which I interact a lot, where apostolic
ministry is now fairly broadly accepted but is seen as pioneer church
planting into unreached people groups.  The distinction is therefore
made between &amp;ldquo;Capital A&amp;rdquo; apostles who defined Scripture and &amp;ldquo;small a&amp;rdquo;
apostles who plant churches in the unreached parts of the world.  The
problem this leads to is that, whilst there is pioneer evangelism and a
grappling with contextualisation issues which I applaud, there is in the
end very little authority at all. Indeed, it has become a philosophy of
ministry for many that the function of the &amp;ldquo;small a&amp;rdquo; apostle, from
another cultural context, is merely to teach the Bible and then allow
the local believers to work out contextualisation because only they
understand their own context.  In what we have been doing in the largely
unreached parts of the world, I have resisted some of this approach
(whilst being passionate about the importance of contextualisation)
because it is hardly what the apostle Paul did in Corinth (even if he
was a &amp;ldquo;Capital A&amp;rdquo; apostle!) Paul did not simply state a few principles
and then let the Corinthians work out how it applied to them; he was
very specific in some of his instructions.  I know we should not develop
our doctrine on apostolic authority in reaction to what others teach,
but it does provide a warning to us.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
I am not even sure that we can make the distinction between &amp;ldquo;Capital A&amp;rdquo;
apostles and &amp;ldquo;small a&amp;rdquo; apostles in New Testament times, with the Twelve,
Paul and James the brother of Jesus in the former category, and
presumably Apollos, Barnabas, Silas and so on in the latter.  The
problem with this is that not all the &amp;ldquo;Capital A&amp;rdquo; apostles were involved
in writing what became recognised as the Canon of Scripture, and some
scholars think that some of the &amp;ldquo;small a&amp;rdquo; apostles were (such as
theories that either Barnabas or Apollos wrote Hebrews). Luke and Mark,
of course, were not apostles, and wrote the Bible anyway. So the
&amp;ldquo;Capital A&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;small a&amp;rdquo; distinction is not as clear as it might
seem. Consequently, I think it is better simply to be clear on what
modern day apostles do, and do not, have the authority to do. They
cannot add to Scripture; they can only apply Scripture as best they
understand it, and respect the judgment of others on Scripture even if
they don&amp;rsquo;t agree with it, within the confines of agreed evangelical
doctrine. Apostles today function in a particular way, and exercise a
certain amount of authority, but they submit that authority to the
revelation of Scripture, and expect those receiving the ministry of the
apostle to similarly submit to Scripture, including testing what the
apostle is saying.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My answers to Andrew&amp;rsquo;s seven questions are also somewhat different in
places. In respect of #1, &amp;ldquo;Should we expect modern day apostles to be
present in spirit when church discipline is conducted in a local
church?&amp;rdquo;, the first point to make is that is not easy to understand what
Paul means by this expression.  However, I would say it depends on the
circumstances and the degree of relationship between the apostle and the
church.  I do not think it is a mystical concept, but that they should
act as though Paul were there, and that because he has the Spirit, and
the Spirit of God is present with them, then through their relationship
Paul is with them with spiritual authority.  Many of the churches that I
serve I would not say that, because my relationship is not as strong as
it is with some others.  I could imagine a few churches, where Scilla
and I have lived for extended times, for them to be able to say not only
that David Devenish has instructed then to take certain action, but that
he is spiritually involved in the decision.  However I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I
could say that for many other situations.  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
I agree with Andrew on #2, that it is not appropriate for modern day
apostles to define their gospel, along the lines of Paul&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;my gospel&amp;rdquo;.
We are entrusted with the gospel, but we have no right to define it for
others (a point at which we are clearly distinct from Paul himself).
With #3, &amp;ldquo;Should modern apostolic ministry involve going to unreached
people groups?&amp;rdquo;, I find it difficult to prove from Scripture that all
apostles went to unreached people groups, though church tradition seems
to suggest that most of them did.  However, even if some apostles do not
feel called to do that themselves, I believe there needs to be an
encouragement and motivation from apostles with reference to Romans 1:5:
receiving grace and apostleship to bring all nations to the obedience of
faith.  This is part of the declaration of the whole counsel of God,
which is an apostolic responsibility.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
#4 is more challenging: &amp;ldquo;Ought modern apostles and prophets to see
themselves as the foundation of a church and live and serve
accordingly?&amp;rdquo; I think there is a sense in which present day apostles and
prophets are personally foundations to the churches in many instances,
even though what they teach must be in accordance with the original
foundation as set out in the New Testament. If not, then we simply join
up with many evangelical commentators who say that the foundation is now
the doctrine of the apostles and prophets, and therefore that if
apostles do still exist, they are just church planting missionaries and
overseers of churches. I would say that in the founding of churches
there is a personalised element as well, in the New Testament and today.
So for example in Acts 2, where they devoted themselves to the apostles&#39;
teaching, it was not just to teaching but to the teaching of people they
knew and trusted who were apostles. I think this still applies today. It
does not mean that the teaching of those apostles must not be tested by
Scripture &amp;ndash; of course it must.  Nevertheless the family feel of the New
Testament church needs to be reproduced in our day, and therefore there
are actual people who are foundational to the life of the church. The
foundation is the same as that which was originally laid, but it needs
laying dynamically in each church in each generation by those with the
gifting, calling and relationship to do so. I agree that in many cases
today, particularly with church adoptions, it is a question of testing
the foundation rather than personally laying it completely &amp;ndash; but if we
deny the personal involvement of the apostles relationally as part of
the foundation, I think we are going too far away from the dynamic
intent of the New Testament.  The foundation is laid personally, not
merely by reading Berkhof or Grudem&amp;rsquo;s&lt;em&gt;Systematic Theology&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
On #5 and #6, I agree with Andrew&amp;rsquo;s article: yes, modern apostles are
accountable directly to God for their work in the gospel and
authenticated by suffering (#5); and whether they can command personal
favours or not depends on the relationship involved (#6). With #7,
though, I find myself disagreeing slightly: &amp;ldquo;Can a modern apostle speak
directly to a local church to correct inaccurate theology, without going
through the elders?&amp;rdquo; Andrew believes that the answer is no, but I am not
so sure. One of the possible mistakes of emphasis that we have made in
Newfrontiers over the last 30 years has been to have a relationship
between apostle (or delegate) and the elders, or sometimes even just
between the apostle and the lead elder, rather than between the apostle
and the church. Sometimes, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, that has been because of a correct
reaction to the approach of apostles who did not believe in the autonomy
of the local church. But I think it is possible &amp;ndash; hard to define, but
easier to discern &amp;ndash; for apostles to have a recognition of the authority
of local elders, whilst still being able, out of their relationship, to
speak to the church as a whole about doctrinal issues (or anything else)
if they think the elders are getting it wrong.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It is extremely helpful to talk these ideas out in public, and because
of our commitment to apostolic ministry today, it is also very important
for the health of the churches we serve. Working out what it means, in
practice, for apostles to serve churches &amp;ndash; and what apostolic authority
actually looks like &amp;ndash; is an important challenge, and one that benefits
from theological discussions like these. Hopefully these reflections
will prove helpful, as we seek to bring about the obedience of faith
among all nations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great response! One brief point of clarification, though: I did not
argue that the A/a distinction is between scripture-writers and others,
but between eyewitnesses and others. This, I believe, is a distinction
that Luke and Paul both made in their writings, and as such needs to be
preserved (even if the capital letters are not the best way of
indicating this!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the article. Do you have a series of markers to look
for/questions to ask in order to test a church&amp;rsquo;s foundations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@Andrew how about Apostles and Bpostles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Andrew &amp;amp; Dave,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you both for your excellent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless I missed this verse as I was reading your articles isn&amp;rsquo;t 1
Corinthians 9.1-2 a KEY verse in all this where Paul distinguishes
between (1) Eye-witnesses and (2) Fathering churches as two types of
apostleship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not SEEN Jesus our Lord?
Are you not the RESULT of my work in the Lord? 2 Even though I may not
be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the SEAL of my
apostleship in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is he not saying to them&amp;hellip;let me prove to you that I am apostles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Because I have seen Jesus, which is what is needed to be an
apostle (Acts 1.22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Because I am your spiritual father. If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t told you the
gospel and then fathered you, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I read this late last night so if these 2 verses were talked
about in the articles and I missed then, then forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Steve: I agree with you that these are the two key roles of an
apostle, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think Paul&amp;rsquo;s point in that text is to delineate and
separate them; his point is more, &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s two reasons why you can be
certain that I am an apostle&amp;rdquo;. But the broader point is right, I think:
there are eyewitness Apostles, and apostles who see people converted in
a community and have an authority on the basis of their spiritual
fathering of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@andrew: so if a church grows up without an apostle then gains one
later in its life how can the &amp;ldquo;spiritual fathering&amp;rdquo; role be played out?

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in
order to observe your own traditions!&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Mark 7:9&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of studies aims to help us examine various crucial aspects
of our faith and practice to see if our traditions have led us to
setting aside the commands of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject of baptism often arouses strong emotions amongst Christians
with disagreements about how necessary it is, how it should be done,
when it should be done and why it is done. These disagreements mostly
arise from differing traditions of how baptism is practiced. It is
important, therefore, that we examine scripture carefully and try to let
it instruct us, rather than simply try to justify our tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-traditions&#34;&gt;Our Traditions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us have been taught something along these lines: Salvation is by
&lt;em&gt;faith alone&lt;/em&gt;, and not by any act or merit on our part. Baptism is a
&lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; declaration of our commitment to follow Jesus. It is a &lt;em&gt;symbol&lt;/em&gt;
of sharing in Jesus&#39; death on the cross and rising again with Him in His
resurrection. Baptism must be undertaken seriously and &lt;em&gt;after proper
instruction&lt;/em&gt;, so that a person properly understands what they are doing.
Some people teach that baptism counts even if it took place before the
person was a believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is helpful to start by listing the various aspects of baptism that we
need to examine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does baptism actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is baptism &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; for salvation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must baptism be by &lt;em&gt;full immersion&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must baptism &lt;em&gt;follow&lt;/em&gt; a conscious desire to be a disciple of Christ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt; should baptism take place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are baptism classes required first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who should &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; the baptising?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must baptism be done in a &lt;em&gt;public church&lt;/em&gt; setting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this study is a list of all the New Testament scriptures
that shed any light on baptism in Jesus name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of these scriptures leads to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-practiced-and-commands-baptism&#34;&gt;Jesus Practiced and Commands Baptism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism &amp;ldquo;fulfils righteousness&amp;rdquo; (Matt 3:13-15). Even Jesus needed to be
baptised. He is the &amp;ldquo;pioneer of our faith&amp;rdquo;, whom we are called to
follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus &amp;hellip; was gaining and baptising more disciples than John. (John
4:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus commands His followers to be &lt;em&gt;baptised&lt;/em&gt; and obey &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; His
commands. (Matt 28:19-20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baptism-is-associated-with-salvation&#34;&gt;Baptism is associated with Salvation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever believes &lt;em&gt;and is baptised&lt;/em&gt; will be saved, but whoever does not
believe will be condemned. (Mark 16:15-16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of
water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy Spirit), he cannot
enter the kingdom of God.  (John 3:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Repent &lt;em&gt;and be baptised&lt;/em&gt;, every one of you, in the name of Jesus
Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. (Acts 2:38-41)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they believed ... they were baptised. Acts 8:12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in
the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were
baptised. (Acts 18:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being
built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through
water, and this water symbolises &lt;em&gt;baptism that now saves you&lt;/em&gt; also &amp;ndash;
not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear
conscience towards God. &lt;em&gt;It saves you&lt;/em&gt; by the resurrection of Jesus
Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God&amp;rsquo;s right hand &amp;ndash; with
angels, authorities and powers in submission to him. (1 Peter 3:20-22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter doesn&amp;rsquo;t say that baptism &lt;em&gt;symbolises&lt;/em&gt; our death and resurrection
with Jesus, but that the flood &lt;em&gt;symbolises&lt;/em&gt; baptism. Baptism is the real
thing, and Peter twice says that &amp;ldquo;baptism saves you&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baptism-was-immediate-and-often-private&#34;&gt;Baptism was immediate and often private&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eunuch said, &amp;lsquo;Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my
being baptised?&amp;rsquo; Philip said, &amp;lsquo;If you believe with all your heart, you
may.&amp;rsquo; The eunuch answered, &amp;lsquo;I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
God.&amp;rsquo; (Acts 8:36-38)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Peter said, &amp;lsquo;Surely no one can stand in the way of their being
baptised with water &amp;hellip; So he ordered that they be baptised in the
name of Jesus Christ. (Acts 10:47-48)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lydia &amp;hellip; was a worshipper of God. The Lord opened her heart to
respond to Paul&amp;rsquo;s message. When she and the members of her household
were baptised, she invited us to her home. (Act 16:14-15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baptism-is-serious&#34;&gt;Baptism is Serious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of
me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy
of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not
worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses
their life for my sake will find it.&amp;quot; (Matthew 10:37-39)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before a person is baptized they should be asked to think seriously
about this scripture. If they cannot enthusiastically say &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; to
Jesus&#39; demand here, they have not understood who Jesus is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baptism-joins-us-to-the-body-of-christ&#34;&gt;Baptism joins us to the Body of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were all baptised by one Spirit so as to form one body. (1 Cor
12:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of you who were baptised into Christ have clothed yourselves with
Christ. (Gal 3:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope
when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and
Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. (Eph 4:4-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baptism-is-for-the-forgiveness-of-sins&#34;&gt;Baptism is for the forgiveness of sins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ
&lt;em&gt;for the forgiveness of your sins&lt;/em&gt;. (Acts 2:38-41)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptised and &lt;em&gt;wash your
sins away&lt;/em&gt;, calling on his name.&amp;rdquo; (Acts 22:16)  &lt;em&gt;(Paul&amp;rsquo;s testimony)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baptism-is-for-cutting-us-off-from-our-sinful-past-to-live-a-new-life&#34;&gt;Baptism is for cutting us off from our sinful past to live a new life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were &lt;em&gt;baptised into Christ Jesus&amp;rsquo; death&lt;/em&gt;. We were buried with him
&amp;hellip; in order that we may live a new life &amp;hellip; united with him in
resurrection. For our old self was crucified with him so that the body
ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be
slaves to sin. If we died with Christ, we will also live with
him. (Rom 6:3-8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your whole self, ruled by the flesh, was put off when you were
circumcised by Christ, &lt;em&gt;having been buried with him in baptism&lt;/em&gt;, in
which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working
of God, who raised him from the dead. (Col 2:11-15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baptism-into-jesus-must-follow-faith-in-jesus&#34;&gt;Baptism into Jesus must &lt;em&gt;follow&lt;/em&gt; faith in Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two incidents recorded in Acts are very instructive about baptism in
more complex cases. These people had been baptised, but needed to be
re-baptised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to
Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the
Scriptures. He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he
spoke with great fervour and taught about Jesus &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accurately&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;though he knew only the baptism of John&lt;/strong&gt;. He began to speak boldly
in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited
him to their home and &lt;strong&gt;explained to him the way of God more
&lt;em&gt;adequately&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. (Acts 18:24-26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we read of Apollos who was a leading disciple of Jesus. He had been
baptised as a believer and was &lt;em&gt;accurately&lt;/em&gt; teaching &lt;em&gt;about Jesus&lt;/em&gt;.
There was no doubt about the authenticity of his faith or discipleship.
Nevertheless Priscilla and Aquila explained the faith &lt;strong&gt;more
adequately.&lt;/strong&gt; In the passage that immediately follows, Paul similarly
encountered some disciples of Jesus who had been baptised as believers,
but whose baptism had been for repentance, rather than into Jesus for
the receiving of the Holy Spirit. Paul instructed them to be re-baptised
into Jesus and we can be confident that this is what is meant by
Priscilla and Aquila explaining the way of God more adequately. In the
light of Paul&amp;rsquo;s instruction, it is inconceivable that Apollos did not
respond to this enlightenment by being re-baptised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollos&amp;rsquo; faith was &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; in so far as it went, but it was
&lt;em&gt;inadequate&lt;/em&gt; in that his believer&amp;rsquo;s baptism had been for &lt;em&gt;repentance&lt;/em&gt;,
and not into Jesus for the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The inadequacy of
his baptism, even though it was by full immersion as an adult believer
in Jesus as the Messiah, is surely important. He and the other believers
at Ephesus did not simply need hands laid on to receive the Holy Spirit;
they had first to be re-baptised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baptism-into-jesus-must-be-followed-by-baptism-in-the-holy-spirit&#34;&gt;Baptism into Jesus must be followed by Baptism in the Holy Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul found some disciples at Ephesus and asked them, &amp;lsquo;Did you receive
the Holy Spirit when you believed?&amp;rsquo; They answered, &amp;lsquo;No, we have not
even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.&amp;rsquo; So Paul asked, &amp;lsquo;Then &lt;strong&gt;what
baptism did you receive?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;John&amp;rsquo;s baptism,&amp;rsquo; they replied&lt;/strong&gt;. Paul said,
&amp;lsquo;John&amp;rsquo;s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to
believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;On hearing
this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;. And when
Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they
spoke with tongues and prophesied. (Acts 19:1-19:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two passages surely present a clear biblical example for us, that
where baptism has not been performed into Jesus for the baptism in the
Holy Spirit, then the appropriate act of obedience and faith is to be
re-baptised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul was surprised to discover these believers were not giving evidence
of having been baptised in the Holy Spirit, so asks them &amp;ldquo;Then what
baptism did you receive?&amp;rdquo; If they had replied &amp;ldquo;Baptism into Jesus&amp;rdquo; we
may assume Paul would simply have laid hands on them to be baptised in
the Holy Spirit &amp;ndash; as Peter did at Antioch. This begs the question:
under what circumstances should we re-baptise people? What constitutes
an &lt;em&gt;inadequate&lt;/em&gt; baptism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem does not seem to lie with the one performing the baptism.
John the Baptist told people to repent and follow Jesus who would take
away their sins. He told them to believe in Jesus as God&amp;rsquo;s Messiah. He
also told them that Jesus would baptise them in the Holy Spirit. John&amp;rsquo;s
baptism was not deficient in instruction or expectation. But for some
reason these disciples had not been instructed about the Holy Spirit
when they were baptised (&amp;ldquo;we have not even heard that there is a Holy
Spirit&amp;rdquo;). It seems that this omission rendered their baptism deficient
in its effect. The defect could not be corrected by teaching and prayer
alone. They had first to be re-baptised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This establishes two important principals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of baptism may be defective due to the recipient being
ignorant about the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instruction followed by re-baptism is the appropriate response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage, along with others, also shows two important truths about
receiving the Holy Spirit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be evident, both to an individual and to others, if a
person has received the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving the Holy Spirit following baptism is not automatic; it
requires prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will look more at what the scriptures teach about receiving the Holy
Spirit in a separate study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Jesus nor any New Testament writer ever says that baptism is a
symbol. It is always presented as the &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; by which a person enters
the Kingdom of God. The death of Jesus on the cross and His resurrection
from the dead is what &lt;em&gt;Jesus&lt;/em&gt; did so that we could be saved, but what
&lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; must do is be baptised in water and the Holy Spirit. We can agree
that salvation is by faith alone, but saving faith is expressed by
obedience, and Jesus commanded baptism in water and the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the NT presents baptism as the &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; of entering the Kingdom of
God, it is never separated from conversion, as a separate event. The
notion that someone can be saved, and then instructed in preparation for
baptism, is totally absent. If preparation classes are deemed necessary,
they should be re-classified as salvation classes, not baptism classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, although salvation is occasionally described without mention of
baptism, the overwhelming evidence of the NT is that baptism was
considered to be an integral and necessary act in a person&amp;rsquo;s salvation.
To separate baptism from salvation is something that the Bible does not
permit us to do. No one who wishes to be obedient to Jesus can excuse
themselves from baptism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person is baptised in ignorance of its meaning, they should be
re-baptised and then have hands laid on to be baptised in the Holy
Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Through baptism&lt;/em&gt; our sins are washed away and forgiven by the death and
resurrection of Jesus. &lt;em&gt;Through baptism&lt;/em&gt; we become part of Jesus&amp;rsquo; body.
&lt;em&gt;Through baptism&lt;/em&gt; we are cut off from our past slavery to sin and given
a new life in Christ. &lt;em&gt;Baptism&lt;/em&gt; is generally a pre-requisite to baptism
in the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the simple biblical answers to our opening questions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does baptism actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;? &amp;ndash; It saves us &amp;hellip; (see previous
paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is baptism &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; for salvation? &amp;ndash; Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must baptism be by &lt;em&gt;full immersion&lt;/em&gt;? &amp;ndash; If possible, otherwise, as
close to immersion as is possible (this was early church practice)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must baptism &lt;em&gt;follow&lt;/em&gt; a conscious desire to be a disciple of Christ?
&amp;ndash; Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt; should baptism take place? &amp;ndash; Immediately following the
confession of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are baptism classes required first? &amp;ndash; No! Only the Gospel must be
understood. BUT: it is serious. It is committing to following Jesus
in priority over all else (dying to self).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who should &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; the baptising? &amp;ndash; Usually the one who led the person
to faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must baptism be done in a &lt;em&gt;public church&lt;/em&gt; setting? &amp;ndash; No. It should
be done at any place convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does our teaching and practice need to be changed in order to obey
the scriptures regarding baptism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;scriptures&#34;&gt;Scriptures:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt 3:13-15 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptised
by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, &amp;lsquo;I need to be baptised by
you, and do you come to me?&amp;rsquo; Jesus replied, &amp;lsquo;Let it be so now; it is
proper for us to do this to fulfil all righteousness.&amp;rsquo; Then John
consented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt 28:19-20 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptising
them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark 16:15-16 He said to them, &amp;lsquo;Go into all the world and preach the
gospel to all creation.  Whoever believes and is baptised will be saved,
but whoever does not believe will be condemned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 3:5 Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is
born of water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy Spirit), he
cannot enter the kingdom of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 4:1 Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was
gaining and baptising more disciples than John (Jesus - actually the
disciples - baptised those who wanted to follow Him).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 2:38-41 Peter replied, &amp;lsquo;Repent and be baptised, every one of you,
in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you
will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. &amp;hellip; Those who accepted his
message were baptised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 8:12 But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news
of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised,
both men and women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 8:36-38 As they travelled along the road, they came to some water
and the eunuch said, &amp;lsquo;Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of
my being baptised?&amp;rsquo; Philip said, &amp;lsquo;If you believe with all your heart,
you may.&amp;rsquo; The eunuch answered, &amp;lsquo;I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son
of God.&amp;rsquo; And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and
the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptised him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 9:18 Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul&amp;rsquo;s eyes, and
he could see again. He got up and was baptised,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 10:47-48 Then Peter said, &amp;lsquo;Surely no one can stand in the way of
their being baptised with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just
as we have.&amp;rsquo; So he ordered that they be baptised in the name of Jesus
Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act 16:14-15 One of those listening was a woman from the city of
Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshipper of
God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul&amp;rsquo;s message. When she
and the members of her household were baptised, she invited us to her
home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 18:8 Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household
believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul
believed and were baptised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 18:24-19:6 Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria,
came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the
Scriptures. He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke
with great fervour and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew
only the baptism of John. He began to speak boldly in the synagogue.
When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and
explained to him the way of God more adequately. While Apollos was at
Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at
Ephesus. There he found some disciples and asked them, &amp;lsquo;Did you receive
the Holy Spirit when you believed?&amp;rsquo; They answered, &amp;lsquo;No, we have not even
heard that there is a Holy Spirit.&amp;rsquo; So Paul asked, &amp;lsquo;Then what baptism
did you receive?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;John&amp;rsquo;s baptism,&amp;rsquo; they replied. Paul said, &amp;lsquo;John&amp;rsquo;s
baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in
the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.&amp;rsquo; On hearing this, they were
baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid hands on
them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and
prophesied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 22:16 And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptised and
wash your sins away, calling on his name.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;(Paul&amp;rsquo;s testimony)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 6:3-8 Or don&amp;rsquo;t you know that all of us who were baptised into Christ
Jesus were baptised into his death? We were therefore buried with him
through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from
the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will
certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we
know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by
sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to
sin &amp;ndash; because anyone who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we
died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Cor 12:13 For we were all baptised by one Spirit so as to form one
body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gal 3:27 for all of you who were baptised into Christ have clothed
yourselves with Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eph 4:4-6 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to
one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God
and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 2:11-15 In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not
performed by human hands. Your whole self, ruled by the flesh, was put
off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him in
baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in
the working of God, who raised him from the dead. When you were dead in
your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive
with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having cancelled the charge of
our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has
taken it away, nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed the powers
and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over
them by the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 3:20-22 God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark
was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved
through water, and this water symbolises baptism that now saves you
also &amp;ndash; not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear
conscience towards God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus
Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God&amp;rsquo;s right hand &amp;ndash; with
angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 5:11&lt;/strong&gt; But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever
sing for joy, and spread your protection over them, that those who love
your name may exult in you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 9:2&lt;/strong&gt; I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to
your name, O Most High.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ps 16:11&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;You have made known to me the path of life; you will fill
me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right
hand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

I whom you have delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 92:4-5&lt;/strong&gt; For you make me glad by your deeds, Lord; I sing for
joy at what your hands have done. How great are your works, Lord, how
profound your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ps 100:1-2&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth. Worship the
LORD with gladness; come before him with joyful songs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ps 126:2-3&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with
songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, &amp;quot;The LORD has done
great things for them.&amp;quot; The LORD has done great things for us, and we
are filled with joy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ps 149:3&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to
him with tambourine and harp.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ne 8:10&lt;/strong&gt; Nehemiah said, &amp;quot;Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks,
and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is sacred to
our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 9:3&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy; they
rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest, as men rejoice when
dividing the plunder.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 12:6&lt;/strong&gt; Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion, for great
is the Holy One of Israel among you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 35:10&lt;/strong&gt; and the ransomed of the LORD will return. They will
enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads.
Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee
away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 61:3&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;and provide for those who grieve in Zion&amp;mdash;to bestow on
them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of
mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They
will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the
display of his splendour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 61:7&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Instead of their shame my people will receive a double
portion, and instead of disgrace they will rejoice in their inheritance;
and so they will inherit a double portion in their land, and everlasting
joy will be theirs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1Ch 16:27&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Splendour and majesty are before him; strength and joy in
his dwelling-place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zephaniah 3:17&lt;/strong&gt; The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who
will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by
his love; he will exult over you with loud singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lu 6:23&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your
reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lu 10:21&lt;/strong&gt; At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit,
said, &amp;quot;I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have
hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to
little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 16:22&lt;/strong&gt; So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see
you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ac 13:52&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy
Spirit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ro 14:17&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and
drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 15:13&lt;/strong&gt; May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as
you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the
Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ga 5:22&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philippians 4:4&lt;/strong&gt; Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say,
Rejoice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1Th 1:6&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;You became imitators of us and of the Lord; in spite of
severe suffering, you welcomed the message with the joy given by the
Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 12:2&lt;/strong&gt; For the joy set before him he endured the cross,
scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1Pe 1:8&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though
you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an
inexpressible and glorious joy,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Breaking Bread - Part 1</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/breaking-bread-part-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/breaking-bread-part-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;breaking-bread----part-1----the-new-passover-supper&#34;&gt;Breaking Bread &amp;ndash; Part 1 &amp;ndash; The New Passover Supper&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-jewish-background-to-the-last-supper&#34;&gt;The Jewish background to the Last Supper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus instituted the last supper, he did not invent something new,
but fulfilled an existing celebration, the Passover supper. This meal
had a special quality that sets it apart from nearly all other
celebrations. Birthday parties, anniversary meals and reunions all look
back to some past event. Graduation parties, retirement parties,
election parties, last-night parties and so on all celebrate a recent
event. A barbeque might simply be celebrating family and friendship and
perhaps a rare but glorious summer evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these elements are in the Passover Supper, but there is another
element which makes the Passover unique; it also celebrates a future
event. It looks forward to the coming Kingdom of God. The Israelites
were delivered in the original Passover from the judgement meted out on
their Egyptian &amp;ldquo;hosts&amp;rdquo; so that they could embark on a journey towards a
liberated and blessed future in the Promised Land. Each year as they
journeyed they celebrated the Passover meal looking back to its
beginning and forward to its completion. Then, when later generations
settled in that land, they continued to celebrate the Passover, yet
still looking both backwards and forwards. They enjoyed and celebrated
what they now possessed &amp;ndash; which their forbears could only dream about -
but they also looked forward to a more complete experience of God&amp;rsquo;s
Kingdom when the earth would be filled with the knowledge of the glory
of the LORD as the waters cover the sea (Hab 2:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Passover meal was a joining together of past and future events that
gave meaning to the present. It celebrated an identity as God&amp;rsquo;s people,
a calling to bring Light to the world , a deliverance from slavery to
darkness, a journey to inherit God&amp;rsquo;s promises, the present blessing of
God&amp;rsquo;s presence and the assurance of a place in God&amp;rsquo;s glorious eternal
fully expressed Kingdom. All of this was encompassed in the Passover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although originally this was celebrated just once a year, by Jesus&#39; day
it was common practice to celebrate this in the home at least once a
week, if not at every main meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Jew every meal was a sacred participation in the gifts of God&amp;rsquo;s
bountiful creation. Thanksgivings were offered before and after each
meal, understanding the food and drink as being a means of communion
with God and with one another. The blessing and breaking of the common
loaf formally opened the act of fellowship. On special occasions the
meal was concluded with a cup of mingled wine and water which was
blessed and passed round. The thanksgiving over the cup brought together
the past, the present and the future, by praising God for His provision,
remembering His redemptive action in history and praying for the coming
of His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-redefinition-of-the-passover-meal&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; redefinition of the Passover Meal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus redefined the Passover meal, giving it a new beginning, a new
middle and a new end. It is still a meal celebrating the journey of
God&amp;rsquo;s people; it is still about our identity, our calling, our
deliverance our journey and our inheritance. But now Jesus Himself is
all of those things. He is the beginning, the journey and the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He Himself is our identity (&amp;ldquo;the church is his body, the fullness of him
who fills everything in every way.&amp;rdquo; Eph 1:23), He is the Light we are
called to bring to the world, He is our deliverer, He is our sustenance
and our inheritance, He is eternally present with us, He is our hope.
And all of this, not as a memory of the past or as a dream for the
future but present in reality with us now. The architect of the Journey
has come to accompany us and to start sharing out the rewards of its
completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-gave-the-passover-meal-a-new-beginning----the-cross&#34;&gt;Jesus gave the Passover meal a new beginning &amp;ndash; the Cross.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came announcing the arrival of the long-awaited Kingdom of God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The time has come,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The kingdom of God has come near.
Repent and believe the good news!&amp;rdquo; (Mark 1:15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Jesus both announced and demonstrated the presence of the
Kingdom and claimed to have bound the strong man and was now plundering
his goods, it seems that all of that was a kind of pre-view to the event
by which He became King and bound the strong man. The Cross was Jesus&#39;
glorification and the moment of Satan&amp;rsquo;s defeat. As He approached
Jerusalem at the beginning of His final week Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified. Most
assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground
and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain&amp;rdquo;
... &amp;quot; Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of
this world will be driven out. And I, if I am lifted up from the
earth, will draw all peoples to Myself.&amp;quot; (John 12:23-24, 31-32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, when the time came for Him to become the King of God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom,
the time of His glorification, when He would be &amp;ldquo;lifted up&amp;rdquo; on the
cross, Jesus celebrated the Passover meal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them,
saying, &amp;ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.&amp;rdquo;
In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, &amp;ldquo;This cup
is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you&amp;rdquo; (Luke
22:19-20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is notable that the Gospel writers make very little attempt to
explain the logic of the Cross. Why Jesus had to die, how His death
established the New Covenant, how His death obtained forgiveness of sins
and so on &amp;ndash; such questions that seem to occupy so much teaching and
preaching and scholarly writing and debate and disagreement &amp;ndash; get scant
attention in the Gospels. The &lt;em&gt;mechanism&lt;/em&gt; of the new beginning is not
part of the Supper, only its celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus gives the Passover meal a new beginning &amp;ndash; the Cross. The
remembrance part of the meal is focused on the self-giving of Jesus as
the inauguration of a new covenant. It is not a remembrance of cruel
injustice, nor of the cost of our sin and rebellion; it is not a
remembrance of the example of Love Jesus gave us. Of course we cannot
forget any of those things, but they are not what Jesus said to
remember. Jesus commands us to remember the start of our new covenant
relationship with God our Father. He gave the supper a new beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-gave-the-passover-meal-a-new-middle----feasting-on-him&#34;&gt;Jesus gave the Passover meal a new middle &amp;ndash; feasting on Him.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supper is a celebration of a new start, but is also more than that.
We don&#39;t just break the bread, we eat it. We pour out the wine and then
we drink it. As well as a remembrance of the start it is also
&lt;em&gt;nourishment&lt;/em&gt; for the journey. And the journey itself is new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of God with us on the journey has a new depth and reality.
Jesus promised he would not leave us orphaned when He was glorified on
the cross. He promised to be with us always, and that the eternal
Godhead would make their home in us. We do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; feast alone, merely
looking forward to a future real presence. Rather, just like with the
disciples on the road to Emmaus, Jesus accompanies us on the journey and
celebrates the Supper with us. But even more than that, He Himself is
the supper!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats
my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them&amp;quot; (John
6:55-56)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the real food that God gives us to sustain us on our journey
towards our inheritance. This is in contrast to the symbolic foods of
Manna, the Passover lamb and the offerings in the Law which were also
eaten. Jesus is the reality to which these things pointed. But Jesus is
also real food in contrast to the many things people crave to feed their
impoverished souls &amp;ndash; wealth, power, popularity, sex. And even, we might
say, Jesus is the real food in contrast to the bread and wine of the
Supper, which of themselves are only symbols of Him. Notice how Jesus
stresses real union with Him: &amp;quot;they in Me, and I in them&amp;quot; - words He
repeats after the Supper and again in His prayer before the cross:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.&amp;quot; (John
14:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am
in you. May they also be in us ... that they may be one as we are
one&amp;mdash; I in them and you in me (John 17:21-23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus told the people that they must eat His flesh and drink His
blood, He was not telling them to share the broken bread and poured out
wine of the Lord&#39;s supper; He was talking about being one with Him;
sharing His life and identity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart
from me you can do nothing.&amp;quot; (John 15:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Jesus gave Himself as the New Covenant which we remember as the start
of our journey, and He also gives Himself to us as our daily bread for
the journey, sustaining our soul and spirit. We feast on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we need more than sustenance along the journey. We also need
guidance and companionship and comfort and motivation. Jesus is all of
these as well (Jn 14:16,23,26, 16:13, Matt 28:20). Jesus gave the Supper
a new middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-gave-the-passover-meal-a-new-end----his-kingdom-on-earth&#34;&gt;Jesus gave the Passover meal a new end &amp;ndash; His Kingdom on earth.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus gave the Supper a new beginning and a new middle. But as we have
seen, the uniqueness of the Passover meal was in that it also looked
forward to an assured future; and Jesus gave the supper a new end. He
said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in
the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo; After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said,
&amp;ldquo;Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink
again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.&amp;rdquo;
(Luke 22:15-18. See also Matt 26:29 and Mark 14:25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not have to wait for long! On the day of the resurrection Jesus
ate fish with the disciples, then broke bread on the road to Emmaus, and
shared breakfast with the disciples on the shores of Galilee, and
according to Peter, Jesus ate and drank with many other witnesses of the
resurrection (Acts 10:41). The fact that Jesus ate and drank with so
many after the resurrection shows us that the Kingdom of God has indeed
come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fifth gospel, Acts, bears powerful testimony that the Kingdom
has indeed come. All the leaders in Jerusalem that had conspired
together to kill Jesus were confronted with the irrefutable evidence
that Jesus was establishing His kingdom through the disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but
whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you
healed.&amp;rdquo; (Acts 4:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this third aspect of the Supper which is perhaps most
misunderstood and challenging to embrace. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem if we
could simply see the Supper as looking forward to the Wedding Supper of
the Lamb in Revelation 19:9, but Jesus does not give us that option
(although that is how most Christians actually take it). Jesus did not
put off &amp;ldquo;eating again until the kingdom comes&amp;rdquo; to the second coming. He
got on with it as soon as He rose from the dead. The &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; to which the
supper looks has already arrived. The Kingdom has come and Jesus is the
King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us live as if Jesus came to start a resistance movement rather
than to announce His Kingdom. This is a huge subject in itself and here
is not the place to explore it. But given that the Gospel is the
announcement of the Kingdom, we must recognise that the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper is
therefore also a celebration and proclamation of its presence and not
merely an anticipation of a far-off dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an element that, for the moment, is still in the future - Paul
said: &amp;ldquo;Whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the
Lord&amp;rsquo;s death until he comes.&amp;rdquo; (1 Cor 11:26). But we must not read this
as if the new end that Jesus gives to the Supper is a distant dream &amp;ndash;
the victorious second coming of Jesus. Yes, that is there in part, and
there are aspects of the new end which remain to be inherited in their
fullness. But the radical new end that Jesus has given the Supper is the
Gospel itself &amp;ndash; the announcement that the Kingdom of God has come!
Jesus has met us on the journey and brought our inheritance into our
present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is King, here today, on this earth. And it is our commission to
make that fact known and invite people to take part. We are not a
resistance movement waiting for the D-Day landings; they have already
taken place and we are commissioned to take the ground that Jesus has
won and tear down the machinery of oppression that continues to
intimidate and enslave those who are ignorant of the new Kingdom. Our
discipleship consists of laying hold of our inheritance and working it
out in the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus has given the Supper new meaning, and to share in the Supper is to
share primarily in a celebration &amp;ndash; celebration of the New Covenant,
celebration of the sustaining presence of Jesus and our union with Him,
celebration of His guiding presence with us along the way and
celebration of the present reality of God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom on earth and our
inheritance of every blessing in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, along with the celebration there is also recognition of the
cost of our inheritance in Christ&amp;rsquo;s suffering (of which the scriptures
make very little) but also, more significantly, we recognise our
incomplete comprehension and experience of the Kingdom of God. We
continue to long for and pray for the Kingdom to come on earth as it is
in Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This then, is the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper; His remodelling of the Passover supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part 2 we will consider the practice of the Supper and some other
aspects of its meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;breaking-bread----part-1----the-new-passover-supper&#34;&gt;Breaking Bread &amp;ndash; Part 1 &amp;ndash; The New Passover Supper&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 22:7-13 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover
lamb had to be sacrificed. Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, &amp;ldquo;Go and
make preparations for us to eat the Passover.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Where do you want us to
prepare for it?&amp;rdquo; they asked. He replied, &amp;ldquo;As you enter the city, a man
carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he
enters, and say to the owner of the house, &amp;lsquo;The Teacher asks: Where is
the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?&amp;rsquo; He will
show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.&amp;rdquo;
They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared
the Passover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus told Peter and John to prepare for the Passover meal and they
asked Him where it should be. His answer was elaborate and detailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear from this that Jesus intended that the celebration should be
properly prepared and also that its location really mattered. Either
Jesus Himself had arranged the place or, as seems likely, the Holy
Spirit made the arrangements having given directions to both Jesus and
the owner of the upper room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we compare this to the current usual practice of breaking bread in
a church service, two contrasts are immediately obvious: firstly the
preparation involved in sharing a piece of bread and a cup of wine is
insignificant compared with a meal, and secondly the location in a
church service is entirely different from in a family room. Jesus could
easily have located the meal in the temple court in view of its great
significance and connection with temple sacrifices. Or he could have
located it in a synagogue in nearby Bethel where he was known and loved.
But Jesus intended that it should be in a secular space, in an ordinary
home. We have got so used to &amp;quot;breaking bread&amp;quot; in a church service that
it is hard for us to think about this occasion as the disciple would
have. We get a much better idea if we think of celebrating Christmas.
Like Christmas, Passover was a major annual celebration. The meal was a
central and essential part. You could not begin to think of celebrating
it without a big carefully prepared meal. Neither would it occur to you
to have your Christmas meal in church, despite it being a celebration of
Jesus&#39; birth. Neither would you think of joining in with a dozen other
families to have a big joint affair. You would hopefully want to invite
one or two lonely people to join in with you, or you might want to do
something especially for lonely people. But you would want it to be as
&amp;quot;authentic&amp;quot; as possible &amp;ndash; a great meal with a family feel and lots of
conversation and maybe some games. Neither would you dream of asking a
priest to officiate over the celebration. Passover was not Christmas,
but I think it was a lot closer to Christmas than it is to &amp;quot;breaking
bread&amp;quot; in a church service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was therefore natural for the disciples to ask about its preparation
and location. They were not at home, so needed to find somewhere they
could celebrate. They found a &amp;quot;man of peace&amp;quot; to offer his home. He was
not someone the disciples knew, but he welcomed them. No doubt he and
his household helped the disciples cook the meal, prepare the room and
witnessed their celebration. It seems likely that he went on to become a
disciple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 22:14-15 When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at
the table. And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this
Passover with you before I suffer.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the disciples, this was just another Passover celebration, one of a
lifetime of such annual celebrations. But for Jesus this was special.
How long had Jesus &amp;quot;eagerly desired to eat this Passover&amp;quot; with them?
Since leaving Galilee on their way to the festival in Jerusalem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus
resolutely set out for Jerusalem.&amp;quot; (Luke 9:51)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or was it since the very beginning of His ministry, when at the wedding
in Cana He said to Mary, &amp;quot;My hour has not yet come&amp;quot;? Or had Jesus been
looking forward to this meal since the original Passover back at the
beginning of Israel&#39;s history? Or perhaps since the Fall or the very
dawn of creation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that for Jesus this was not &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; Passover celebration but
&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Passover celebration, to which all previous ones had been
pointing. Judgement has been lifted from God&#39;s people and would now and
forever pass over them as Jesus Himself becomes our righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can only imagine what it must have been like for Jesus to celebrate
this meal with a bunch of people who had no idea of its eternal
significance. I can imagine Him wishing that Elijah and Moses, who he
shared with at the Transfiguration, could have been there. He must have
longed to talk about the big-picture of God&#39;s eternal purposes and the
true meaning of Passover and the huge significance of the New Covenant.
But instead the disciples kept bringing the focus of conversation back
to themselves &amp;ndash; who would betray Jesus, who was the greatest, who would
never deny Jesus...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 22:15-19 And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this
Passover with you before I suffer. &lt;strong&gt;(16)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;For I tell you, I will not
eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; After
taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, &amp;ldquo;Take this and divide it among
you. For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine
until the kingdom of God comes.&amp;rdquo; And he took bread, gave thanks and
broke it, and gave it to them, saying, &amp;ldquo;This is my body given for you;
do this in remembrance of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus again emphasises how unique this occasion is by telling the
disciples that this meal and this drink (v17) would be His last until
the Kingdom had come. He wanted the disciples to understand that this
was a turning point in history that would usher in the Kingdom that they
had spent the previous three years announcing and demonstrating. He is
surely also telling them that the terrible events about to unfold are
not the end, but the fulfilment of the Passover they had been
celebrating for years without properly understanding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not have to wait long before the Passover was fulfilled in His
death on the cross. One of His first acts after His resurrection was to
eat with his disciples &amp;ndash; something that Luke makes a point of
recording:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 10:48 &amp;quot;He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom
God had already chosen&amp;mdash;by us who ate and drank with him after he rose
from the dead.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of course is that the Passover is now fulfilled and the
Kingdom has come. We are forever delivered from the kingdom of darkness
into the Kingdom of Light. Up to this point the Passover had been both a
reminder of past deliverance and also a promise of future deliverance.
But that future deliverance had now come and there was no longer a need
to look back to the original Passover. This new Passover was not
something to be remembered, but to be lived and experienced afresh each
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 22:15-19 And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this
Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it
again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;(17)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;After
taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, &amp;ldquo;Take this and divide it among
you.&lt;/strong&gt; For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine
until the kingdom of God comes.&amp;rdquo; And he took bread, gave thanks and
broke it, and gave it to them, saying, &amp;ldquo;This is my body given for you;
do this in remembrance of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus takes the bread and the cup and gives thanks. This is the
thanksgiving before the meal (saying grace as we might call it). He then
tells the disciples to divide it among themselves. I think this
instruction was intentional and important. He deliberately gave the
disciples responsibility to share the food out because it created an
opportunity for heart attitudes to be revealed &amp;ndash; for good or for bad.
He then used it as an opportunity for teaching them about servanthood
(vv24-30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the NT we see this working out amongst another group of
disciples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 11:17-22 In the following directives I have no praise for
you, for your meetings do more harm than good. In the first place, I
hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among
you, and to some extent I believe it. No doubt there have to be
differences among you to show which of you have God&amp;rsquo;s approval. So then,
when you come together, it is not the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper you eat, for when
you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a
result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. Don&amp;rsquo;t you have
homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by
humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I
praise you? Certainly not in this matter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For various reasons the traditional churches stopped having a meal when
celebrating the Lord&#39;s supper. One of the reasons given is because Paul
writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 14:40 &amp;quot;But everything should be done in a fitting and
orderly way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meal usually involves a certain degree of disorderliness, especially
compared to a liturgical service. By leaving the meal out, so that all
you have is the thanksgiving, you certainly have something more orderly.
But is this what Jesus wants? Do we really think that God is concerned
with orderliness in our services &amp;ndash; or is His concern the attitudes of
our hearts that give rise to disorderliness? Remember that Jesus&#39; own
Last Supper was a proper meal, with lively discussion and it also
resulted in a certain amount of argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no suggestion that Jesus was embarrassed at the disorderliness
of His meal, or that Paul though it would be better to leave the meal
out. For both Jesus and Paul, their response to the bad attitudes that
emerged from the meal was to address the heart attitudes. The meal is an
important aspect of discipleship &amp;ndash; it is an opportunity to show
interest and concern for one another, to talk about Jesus, to serve one
another. It is also an opportunity for selfishness and bad attitudes to
be seen so that the deeper needs of the community can be identified and
addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest therefore that both the meal, and the instruction that the
members should share it amongst themselves, are important aspects of
what Jesus instructed us to do together. Leaving these aspects out
removes the opportunity for discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 22:15-19 And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this
Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it
again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo; After taking the
cup, he gave thanks and said, &amp;ldquo;Take this and divide it among you. &lt;strong&gt;(18)
For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until
the kingdom of God comes.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; And he took bread, gave thanks and broke
it, and gave it to them, saying, &amp;ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this
in remembrance of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already seen that Jesus ate and drank with the disciples and
many others after the resurrection, so we can take those meals as proof
that Jesus considered that His Kingdom had indeed come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 22:15-19 And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this
Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it
again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo; After taking the
cup, he gave thanks and said, &amp;ldquo;Take this and divide it among you. For I
tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the
kingdom of God comes.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;(19) And he took bread, gave thanks and broke
it, and gave it to them, saying, &amp;ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this
in remembrance of me.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus now introduces a completely new idea into the Passover meal. Jesus
points to the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; they are sharing and eating, not the Passover
lamb! Jesus was the Passover Lamb (as John the Baptist recognised &amp;ndash;
John 1:29 &amp;ldquo;Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the
world!&amp;quot;) so we would expect Jesus to say &amp;quot;This &lt;em&gt;lamb&lt;/em&gt; is My Body
broken for you&amp;quot; but instead He points to the bread. He calls the bread
&amp;quot;My body&amp;quot; but He doesn&#39;t say it is &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt; for them, but &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; for
them. This is clearly a reference to what He had previously said about
being the Bread of Life that the Father gave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 6:32-59 &amp;quot;My Father gives you the true bread from heaven ... I
am the bread of life ... This bread is my flesh, which I will give
for the life of the world ... my flesh is real food and my blood is
real drink ... The words I have spoken to you&amp;mdash;they are full of the
Spirit and life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Jesus tells us that He Himself is the food and drink we need to
sustain us in life. Jesus clearly means His teaching and His example and
not just His sacrificial death &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;[My] words ... are full of the
Spirit and life&amp;quot;. So we conclude that in the Last Supper Jesus offered
the bread as a symbol and reminder of His life and teachings, not just
His death. It is remarkable that Jesus never even mentioned the Passover
Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Jesus diverts attention towards the bread suggests to me
that He intended the focus of the meal to be a remembrance of His life
and teachings, rather than dwelling on His death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further indication of this is His use of the phrase &amp;quot;do this in
remembrance of me.&amp;quot; It is inconceivable that Jesus was concerned that
we might forget that He died for us unless we regularly broke-bread in
order to remember it! Think about this. Do you think we need to break
bread to stop us forgetting that Jesus died? The Salvation Army don&#39;t
celebrate the Last Supper but they have not forgotten the Cross. The
idea that we need to celebrate the Last Supper lest we forget the Cross
is bizarre and ridiculous. That is not what remembrance of the dead is
for. People do not remember the dead to remember their death, but to
remember their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of celebrating the last supper is not to remind us
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Jesus died for us, but &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; He died. His toast at the
end of the meal (Luke 22:20) tells us what Jesus wanted us to remember
&amp;ndash; the New Covenant. In other words the celebration is about His life in
us now, not His death for us 2000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do this in remembrance of me&amp;quot; is very likely a reference to the
Jewish practice of sharing bread and wine in remembrance of the life of
someone who has died:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 16:4,7(NKJV) &amp;quot;they shall not be lamented nor shall they be
buried ... Nor shall men break bread in mourning for them, to comfort
them for the dead; nor shall men give them the cup of consolation to
drink for their father or their mother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah is writing about a terrible judgement to come where so many
will die that they will be left unburied and un-mourned for. But what we
learn is that the custom was to &lt;em&gt;break bread and share a cup of
consolation&lt;/em&gt; when someone died (the NIV is not so clear). Jesus adds
this custom to the Passover celebration at the Last Supper because this
meal is not just the remembrance of deliverance, but the remembrance of
an extraordinary &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;. Whenever people remember their dead, they
remember their lives, not the details of their death. That is surely
what Jesus intends for us. We are to feed on His word and His example
and on His living presence with us, remembering that in His death He has
not left us as orphans, but He is forever with us (Matt 28:20) and is
coming again in Glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of focussing on the death of Jesus when we celebrate the
Last Supper is, I believe, missing the point. It is His Life that feeds
us, not His death. It seems to me that the focus of conversation when we
celebrate the Last Supper should be the words and life of Jesus and His
present effect on our lives. This is made even clearer in the next verse
in Luke&#39;s account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 22:20 In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying,
&amp;ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for
you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they had shared both the meal and their conversation, Jesus raised
the cup in a similar way that we would propose a toast after a special
meal. &amp;ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for
you.&amp;quot; This is the first clear reference in the meal to His death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But notice that Jesus does not say &amp;ldquo;This cup is &lt;em&gt;My blood&lt;/em&gt; which is
poured out for you&amp;quot; but &amp;ldquo;This cup is the &lt;em&gt;new covenant&lt;/em&gt; in my blood,
which is poured out for you.&amp;quot; Jesus is drawing our attention &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; the
New Covenant, and not dwelling on His death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law of Moses was written on stone tablets, but Jesus&#39; New Covenant
was to be written on our hearts by the Holy Spirit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 31:31-34 &amp;ldquo;Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I
will make a new covenant ... I will put My law in their minds, and
write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be
My people ... they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the
greatest of them, says the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity,
and their sin I will remember no more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 22:20 &amp;ldquo;This cup is the &lt;strong&gt;new covenant&lt;/strong&gt; in my blood, which is
poured out &lt;strong&gt;for you&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Jesus was &amp;quot;toasting&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; the fact that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; can now
all know the Lord ourselves through the Spirit. Jesus says to celebrate
that He gave Himself &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;for us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Jesus is saying, &amp;quot;Don&#39;t you ever
forget what I have accomplished for you. Don&#39;t go back to the Law.
Don&#39;t go back to slavery. Don&#39;t forget that I am with you always and
alive forevermore. Don&#39;t forget that you are seated with me in the
heavenly places to rule with me in My Kingdom. That is why after the
meal Jesus said to them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 22:29-30 &amp;quot;I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred
one on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and
sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the point and purpose of celebrating the Last Supper &amp;quot;in
remembrance of me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 13:4-12 He got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and
wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a
basin and began to wash his disciples&#39; feet, drying them with the
towel that was wrapped around him ... When he had finished washing
their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The washing of the disciple&#39;s feet seems to have been the way that
Jesus responded to the argument that Luke tells us broke out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 22:24 A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was
considered to be greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the
table. 22The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that
man who betrays him!&amp;rdquo; 23They began to question among themselves which of
them it might be who would do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to
be greatest. 25Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles lord it
over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves
Benefactors. 26But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest
among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the
one who serves. 27For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the
one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among
you as one who serves. 28You are those who have stood by me in my
trials. 29And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one
on me, 30so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit
on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taking of this second cup was a quite separate act from the
thanksgiving and sharing that took place at the start of the meal. Paul
also makes the distinction between these two acts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Cor 11:23-25 For I received from the Lord that which I also
delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He
was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and
said, &amp;ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in
remembrance of Me.&amp;rdquo; In the same manner He also took the cup &lt;strong&gt;after
supper&lt;/strong&gt;, saying, &amp;ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do,
as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**^26 ^**For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you
proclaim the Lord&amp;rsquo;s death till He comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-jewish-background-to-the-last-supper&#34;&gt;The Jewish background to the Last Supper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus instituted the last supper, he did not invent something new,
but fulfilled an existing celebration, the Passover supper. This meal
had a special quality that sets it apart from nearly all other
celebrations. Birthday parties, anniversary meals and reunions all look
back to some past event. Graduation parties, retirement parties,
election parties, last-night parties and so on all celebrate a recent
event. A barbeque might simply be celebrating family and friendship and
perhaps a rare but glorious summer evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these elements are in the Passover Supper, but there is another
element which makes the Passover unique; it also celebrates a future
event. It looks forward to the coming Kingdom of God. The Israelites
were delivered in the original Passover from the judgement meted out on
their Egyptian &amp;ldquo;hosts&amp;rdquo; so that they could embark on a journey towards a
liberated and blessed future in the Promised Land. Each year as they
journeyed they celebrated the Passover meal looking back to its
beginning and forward to its completion. Then, when later generations
settled in that land, they continued to celebrate the Passover, yet
still looking both backwards and forwards. They enjoyed and celebrated
what they now possessed &amp;ndash; which their forbears could only dream about -
but they also looked forward to a more complete experience of God&amp;rsquo;s
Kingdom when the earth would be filled with the knowledge of the glory
of the LORD as the waters cover the sea (Hab 2:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Passover meal was a joining together of past and future events that
gave meaning to the present. It celebrated an identity as God&amp;rsquo;s people,
a calling to bring Light to the world , a deliverance from slavery to
darkness, a journey to inherit God&amp;rsquo;s promises, the present blessing of
God&amp;rsquo;s presence and the assurance of a place in God&amp;rsquo;s glorious eternal
fully expressed Kingdom. All of this was encompassed in the Passover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although originally this was celebrated just once a year, by Jesus&#39; day
it was common practice to celebrate this in the home at least once a
week, if not at every main meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Jew every meal was a sacred participation in the gifts of God&amp;rsquo;s
bountiful creation. Thanksgivings were offered before and after each
meal, understanding the food and drink as being a means of communion
with God and with one another. The blessing and breaking of the common
loaf formally opened the act of fellowship. On special occasions the
meal was concluded with a cup of mingled wine and water which was
blessed and passed round. The thanksgiving over the cup brought together
the past, the present and the future, by praising God for His provision,
remembering His redemptive action in history and praying for the coming
of His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-redefinition-of-the-passover-meal&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; redefinition of the Passover Meal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus redefined the Passover meal, giving it a new beginning, a new
middle and a new end. It is still a meal celebrating the journey of
God&amp;rsquo;s people; it is still about our identity, our calling, our
deliverance our journey and our inheritance. But now Jesus Himself is
all of those things. He is the beginning, the journey and the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He Himself is our identity (&amp;ldquo;the church is his body, the fullness of him
who fills everything in every way.&amp;rdquo; Eph 1:23), He is the Light we are
called to bring to the world, He is our deliverer, He is our sustenance
and our inheritance, He is eternally present with us, He is our hope.
And all of this, not as a memory of the past or as a dream for the
future but present in reality with us now. The architect of the Journey
has come to accompany us and to start sharing out the rewards of its
completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-gave-the-passover-meal-a-new-beginning----the-cross&#34;&gt;Jesus gave the Passover meal a new beginning &amp;ndash; the Cross.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came announcing the arrival of the long-awaited Kingdom of God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The time has come,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The kingdom of God has come near. Repent
and believe the good news!&amp;rdquo; (Mark 1:15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Jesus both announced and demonstrated the presence of the
Kingdom and claimed to have bound the strong man and was now plundering
his goods, it seems that all of that was a kind of pre-view to the event
by which He became King and bound the strong man. The Cross was Jesus&#39;
glorification and the moment of Satan&amp;rsquo;s defeat. As He approached
Jerusalem at the beginning of His final week Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified. Most
assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground
and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain&amp;rdquo; ...
&amp;quot; Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this
world will be driven out. And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will
draw all peoples to Myself.&amp;rdquo; (John 12:23-24, 31-32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, when the time came for Him to become the King of God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom,
the time of His glorification, when He would be &amp;ldquo;lifted up&amp;rdquo; on the
cross, Jesus celebrated the Passover meal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them,
saying, &amp;ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.&amp;rdquo;
In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, &amp;ldquo;This cup is
the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you&amp;rdquo; (Luke
22:19-20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is notable that the Gospel writers make very little attempt to
explain the logic of the Cross. Why Jesus had to die, how His death
established the New Covenant, how His death obtained forgiveness of sins
and so on &amp;ndash; such questions that seem to occupy so much teaching and
preaching and scholarly writing and debate and disagreement &amp;ndash; get scant
attention in the Gospels. The &lt;em&gt;mechanism&lt;/em&gt; of the new beginning is not
part of the Supper, only its celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus gives the Passover meal a new beginning &amp;ndash; the Cross. The
remembrance part of the meal is focused on the self-giving of Jesus as
the inauguration of a new covenant. It is not a remembrance of cruel
injustice, nor of the cost of our sin and rebellion; it is not a
remembrance of the example of Love Jesus gave us. Of course we cannot
forget any of those things, but they are not what Jesus said to
remember. Jesus commands us to remember the start of our new covenant
relationship with God our Father. He gave the supper a new beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-gave-the-passover-meal-a-new-middle----feasting-on-him&#34;&gt;Jesus gave the Passover meal a new middle &amp;ndash; feasting on Him.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supper is a celebration of a new start, but is also more than that.
We don&#39;t just break the bread, we eat it. We pour out the wine and then
we drink it. As well as a remembrance of the start it is also
&lt;em&gt;nourishment&lt;/em&gt; for the journey. And the journey itself is new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of God with us on the journey has a new depth and reality.
Jesus promised he would not leave us orphaned when He was glorified on
the cross. He promised to be with us always, and that the eternal
Godhead would make their home in us. We do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; feast alone, merely
looking forward to a future real presence. Rather, just like with the
disciples on the road to Emmaus, Jesus accompanies us on the journey and
celebrates the Supper with us. But even more than that, He Himself is
the supper!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my
flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them&amp;quot; (John 6:55-56)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the real food that God gives us to sustain us on our journey
towards our inheritance. This is in contrast to the symbolic foods of
Manna, the Passover lamb and the offerings in the Law which were also
eaten. Jesus is the reality to which these things pointed. But Jesus is
also real food in contrast to the many things people crave to feed their
impoverished souls &amp;ndash; wealth, power, popularity, sex. And even, we might
say, Jesus is the real food in contrast to the bread and wine of the
Supper, which of themselves are only symbols of Him. Notice how Jesus
stresses real union with Him: &amp;quot;they in Me, and I in them&amp;quot; - words He
repeats after the Supper and again in His prayer before the cross:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.&amp;quot; (John 14:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in
you. May they also be in us ... that they may be one as we are one&amp;mdash; I
in them and you in me (John 17:21-23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus told the people that they must eat His flesh and drink His
blood, He was not telling them to share the broken bread and poured out
wine of the Lord&#39;s supper; He was talking about being one with Him;
sharing His life and identity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from
me you can do nothing.&amp;quot; (John 15:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Jesus gave Himself as the New Covenant which we remember as the start
of our journey, and He also gives Himself to us as our daily bread for
the journey, sustaining our soul and spirit. We feast on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we need more than sustenance along the journey. We also need
guidance and companionship and comfort and motivation. Jesus is all of
these as well (Jn 14:16,23,26, 16:13, Matt 28:20). Jesus gave the Supper
a new middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-gave-the-passover-meal-a-new-end----his-kingdom-on-earth&#34;&gt;Jesus gave the Passover meal a new end &amp;ndash; His Kingdom on earth.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus gave the Supper a new beginning and a new middle. But as we have
seen, the uniqueness of the Passover meal was in that it also looked
forward to an assured future; and Jesus gave the supper a new end. He
said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the
kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo; After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, &amp;ldquo;Take
this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again from
the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.&amp;rdquo; (Luke 22:15-18.
See also Matt 26:29 and Mark 14:25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not have to wait for long! On the day of the resurrection Jesus
ate fish with the disciples, then broke bread on the road to Emmaus, and
shared breakfast with the disciples on the shores of Galilee, and
according to Peter, Jesus ate and drank with many other witnesses of the
resurrection (Acts 10:41). The fact that Jesus ate and drank with so
many after the resurrection shows us that the Kingdom of God has indeed
come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fifth gospel, Acts, bears powerful testimony that the Kingdom
has indeed come. All the leaders in Jerusalem that had conspired
together to kill Jesus were confronted with the irrefutable evidence
that Jesus was establishing His kingdom through the disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but
whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.&amp;rdquo;
(Acts 4:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this third aspect of the Supper which is perhaps most
misunderstood and challenging to embrace. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem if we
could simply see the Supper as looking forward to the Wedding Supper of
the Lamb in Revelation 19:9, but Jesus does not give us that option
(although that is how most Christians actually take it). Jesus did not
put off &amp;ldquo;eating again until the kingdom comes&amp;rdquo; to the second coming. He
got on with it as soon as He rose from the dead. The &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; to which the
supper looks has already arrived. The Kingdom has come and Jesus is the
King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us live as if Jesus came to start a resistance movement rather
than to announce His Kingdom. This is a huge subject in itself and here
is not the place to explore it. But given that the Gospel is the
announcement of the Kingdom, we must recognise that the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper is
therefore also a celebration and proclamation of its presence and not
merely an anticipation of a far-off dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an element that, for the moment, is still in the future - Paul
said: &amp;ldquo;Whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the
Lord&amp;rsquo;s death until he comes.&amp;rdquo; (1 Cor 11:26). But we must not read this
as if the new end that Jesus gives to the Supper is a distant dream &amp;ndash;
the victorious second coming of Jesus. Yes, that is there in part, and
there are aspects of the new end which remain to be inherited in their
fullness. But the radical new end that Jesus has given the Supper is the
Gospel itself &amp;ndash; the announcement that the Kingdom of God has come!
Jesus has met us on the journey and brought our inheritance into our
present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is King, here today, on this earth. And it is our commission to
make that fact known and invite people to take part. We are not a
resistance movement waiting for the D-Day landings; they have already
taken place and we are commissioned to take the ground that Jesus has
won and tear down the machinery of oppression that continues to
intimidate and enslave those who are ignorant of the new Kingdom. Our
discipleship consists of laying hold of our inheritance and working it
out in the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus has given the Supper new meaning, and to share in the Supper is to
share primarily in a celebration &amp;ndash; celebration of the New Covenant,
celebration of the sustaining presence of Jesus and our union with Him,
celebration of His guiding presence with us along the way and
celebration of the present reality of God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom on earth and our
inheritance of every blessing in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, along with the celebration there is also recognition of the
cost of our inheritance in Christ&amp;rsquo;s suffering (of which the scriptures
make very little) but also, more significantly, we recognise our
incomplete comprehension and experience of the Kingdom of God. We
continue to long for and pray for the Kingdom to come on earth as it is
in Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This then, is the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper; His remodelling of the Passover supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part 2 we will consider the practice of the Supper and some other
aspects of its meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coming to Faith for Healing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/healing/coming-to-faith-for-healing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/healing/coming-to-faith-for-healing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;coming-to-faith-for-healing&#34;&gt;Coming to Faith for Healing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago God gave me a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believed that all we can do is pray and leave the answer to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus had called the Twelve together, &lt;strong&gt;he gave them power and
authority&lt;/strong&gt; to drive out all demons and &lt;strong&gt;to cure diseases&lt;/strong&gt;, and he
sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and &lt;strong&gt;to heal the sick&lt;/strong&gt;.
(&lt;strong&gt;Lk 9:1&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you enter a town and are welcomed &amp;hellip; Heal the sick who are there
and tell them, &amp;lsquo;The kingdom of God is near you.&#39;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Lu 10:8-9&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not &amp;ldquo;according to God&amp;rsquo;s will let it be done to you&amp;rdquo;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is it always God&amp;rsquo;s will to heal?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their
synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every
disease and sickness.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mt 9:35&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their
sick and those tormented by evil spirits, and &lt;strong&gt;all of them were
healed&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 5:16&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None went home sick! Was Jesus too soft?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke says, &amp;ldquo;God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and
with power, who went about doing good and &lt;em&gt;healing all&lt;/em&gt; who were
oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ac 10:38&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus viewed His mission as healing &amp;amp; deliverance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Go tell that fox, &amp;lsquo;I will drive out demons and heal people today and
tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.&#39;&amp;quot; (&lt;strong&gt;Lu 13:32&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tinnitus, Molly, William, Helena, Grandpa with Cataracts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Laurence
&amp;ndash; no result!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;amp; my tinnitus!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the devil can&amp;rsquo;t stop us praying, then he will try to keep us praying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that
they will be heard for their many words.&amp;quot; (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 6:7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words of knowledge. &lt;strong&gt;Laurence stood up!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose faith? No faith is not the same as unbelief! Jesus couldn&amp;rsquo;t heal
because of unbelief. &lt;strong&gt;Sheila&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ear ache&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus looked up and said, &amp;quot;Father, I thank you that you have heard
me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of
the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.&amp;quot;
(&lt;strong&gt;Jn 11:41-42&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheila&amp;rsquo;s broken arm&lt;/strong&gt; - Speak to this mountain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Have faith in God,&amp;quot; Jesus answered. &amp;quot;I tell you the truth, if anyone
says to this mountain, &amp;lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,&amp;rsquo; and does not
doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will
be done for him. (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 11:23-24&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentally handicapped girl needed persistent prayer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lk 18.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never reprimanded for too bold a faith!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You of little faith, why are you so afraid?&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;(Matt 8:26)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite definition of a righteous person is this, &amp;ldquo;He gets up
again.&amp;rdquo; It comes from this wonderful scripture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will look to the LORD, I will wait for the God of my salvation; my
God will hear me. Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I
shall rise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Micah 7:7-8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are believers. Turn on your believer!!! Doubting is a miserable
pastime whereas there is such joy and peace in believing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom
15:13&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Developing Leadership Teams</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/developing-leadership-teams/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/developing-leadership-teams/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;developing-leadership-teams&#34;&gt;Developing Leadership Teams&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;present teaching relates specifically to developing leadership teams,
and assumes that the leaders have embraced the principles set out in
&amp;quot;Servant Leadership&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;relevant-points-from-servant-leadership&#34;&gt;Relevant points from &amp;quot;Servant Leadership&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;called-to-serve&#34;&gt;Called to Serve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders and leadership teams are called to serve the people of God, not
to rule over them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus called them together and said, &amp;quot;You know that those who are
regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high
officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead,
whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and
whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.&amp;quot; (Mk 10:42-44 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;leading-by-example&#34;&gt;Leading by Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdom leadership depends not upon authority and duty but on vision,
inspiration, empowerment and love:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be shepherds of God&amp;rsquo;s flock that is under your care, serving as
overseers&amp;mdash;not because you must, but because you are willing, as God
wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve; not lording
it over those entrusted to you, but &lt;strong&gt;being examples to the flock&lt;/strong&gt;.
And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of
glory that will never fade away.&amp;rdquo; (1Pe 5:2-4 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Follow my example&lt;/strong&gt;, as I follow the example of Christ.&amp;rdquo; (1Co 11:1
NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see here that the character of a leader is crucial, not just the
ability to perform a task. In the Kingdom, &lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt; is the most
important quality. If the person does not live what they tell others to
do, they are not suitable for leadership. Leaders must lead by example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;to-achieve-a-goal&#34;&gt;To Achieve a Goal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaders serve the members by helping them to achieve a goal they
value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However well our leaders may agree with the principles of servant
leadership, the fact remains that leaders tend to be strong willed,
determined, ambitious and sometimes ruthless. Because of this leadership
teams only function properly when they recognise that there is some
worthwhile goal that can only be achieved through common and organised
effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation-through-envisioning&#34;&gt;Motivation through Envisioning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership service includes clearly explaining the reason for the task
being performed and envisioning the team/church members so that they
willingly give sufficient priority to the required activities. Servant
leadership does not include coercing members to do what they don&#39;t want
to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;taking-the-problem-to-jesus&#34;&gt;Taking the Problem to Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people are not willing to participate in the way the leader wishes
then the leader must go back to Jesus with the problem. Either the
leader&amp;rsquo;s goal or its timing is wrong, or they have failed to share the
vision for the goal clearly enough, or else the person is inappropriate
for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we see this with the Transfiguration (Matt 17). Jesus had a
problem getting through to His disciples. He was trying to get them to
see that He truly was God&#39;s Son, and was pleased with Peter&#39;s
response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who do you say I am?&amp;rdquo; Simon Peter answered, &amp;ldquo;You are the Messiah, the
Son of the living God.&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon son of
Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my
Father in heaven. (Matt 16:15-17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that foundation, He then tried to tell them about the cross, but they
would not listen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must
go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the
chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed
and on the third day be raised to life. Peter took him aside and began
to rebuke him. &amp;ldquo;Never, Lord!&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;This shall never happen to
you!&amp;rdquo; Jesus turned and said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;Get behind me, Satan! You are a
stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God,
but merely human concerns.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 16:21-23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had a problem. His disciples would not accept what Jesus was
saying. Even Peter who said he believed Jesus was God&#39;s Son was
refusing to listen to what Jesus was trying to tell him. Jesus took that
problem to the Father who said, &amp;quot;OK. I&#39;ll have a chat with them.&amp;quot;
This is what happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, &amp;ldquo;This is
my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. &lt;strong&gt;Listen to him&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;rdquo;
(Matt 17:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is our only resort if people do not get what we are trying to say.
We make our appeal to them, and then must leave it to God to speak into
their hearts. In the meantime we must continue to try and lead by
example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forming-a-leadership-team-within-a-church&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forming a Leadership Team Within a Church&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental question in forming a leadership team within a church is
&amp;quot;Are we trying to raise servants to support the church activities, or
leaders who are expected to hear and obey Jesus?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for servants to support the church activities you
will look for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who agree with you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliant people who tend not to argue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with appropriate skills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People others will respect and obey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for Kingdom leaders you will look for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with a passion for Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who hear God for themselves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who question what is being said and done&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who take risks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are not swayed by what others think of them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with a growing sense of their own calling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People whose passion, focus and direction is compatible but
different from ours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering and promoting Kingdom leaders within a church is often a real
challenge to the existing leadership &amp;ndash; one which few leaders are
prepared to embrace. As a consequence, church leadership teams tend to
be management teams, serving the lead-leader and the church program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forming-a-leadership-team-across-churches&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forming a Leadership Team across Churches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental question in forming a leadership team between churches
is &amp;quot;What is this for?&amp;quot; Here are some reasons church leaders meet
together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus prayed for our unity in John 17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some joint project they are involved in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They want to learn from other churches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership is lonely and they want the companionship or support of
other leaders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They want to be part of something bigger (prestige)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They want to influence other churches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They want to build a &amp;quot;kingdom&amp;quot; of relating churches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason is, it must be rooted in the Kingdom with Jesus as
the head. &amp;quot;It just seemed like a good thing to do&amp;quot; is not good enough.
What is the point in a &amp;quot;talking shop&amp;quot; that achieves nothing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine cooperation between church leaders is often difficult to
achieve. The problem is that they are all leaders and not used to being
led. Worthwhile cooperation between leaders only occurs when they
recognise that a goal they value can only be achieved together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-a-team-to-function&#34;&gt;Getting a Team to Function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task of leading a leadership team is fundamentally one of
identifying a common goal and envisioning the team so that they
willingly subjugate their own priorities for the sake of this greater
goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good starting point is simply to encourage leaders to share their
experience with one another with the accepted aim of influencing one
another to shape the direction of the church and its mission. The aim is
not uniformity, but stronger and more effective diversity. Where there
is a commitment to sharing, listening and learning, teams can work very
well and become very open to the Holy Spirit&amp;rsquo;s leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identify-jesus-gifts-of-people&#34;&gt;Identify Jesus&#39; Gifts of People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a leadership team to function effectively there needs to be a
recognition and celebration of the different qualities and characters
that each member brings. We must be clear that our unity is not in
uniformity but in Christ. We are not all hands or feet, we are all
different members of Christ&#39;s Body. So it is valuable to look at the
various lists of gifts mentioned in the New Testament and to try and
identify each other&#39;s gifting (Rom 12, 1 Cor 12, Eph 4). These lists
are clearly illustrative rather than exhaustive. People may have gifts
that are not listed in these passages or which are better described in
some other way. The point is that they should be recognised, celebrated,
encouraged and valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;held-together-by-love&#34;&gt;Held Together by Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and greatest commandment Jesus gave us is to love one another.
According to Paul in Ephesians 4:16, the purpose of Jesus&#39; gifts of
leadership are to enable the &amp;quot;the whole body, joined and held together
by every supporting ligament, to grow and build itself up in love, as
each part does its work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is nowhere more important than in a leadership team. If the
leadership team cannot give an example of love then we might as well
give up and go home! Do you think that Jesus is impressed by &amp;quot;We led
very well in all sorts of ways; but we never managed to love one
another&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love requires openness and honesty. Leaders can find this difficult if
they are used to trying to project an impressive image. We see this
problem recurring throughout the New Testament. Only if we walk in the
light with each other can we truly have fellowship in love (1 Jn 1:7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genuine-friendship&#34;&gt;Genuine Friendship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call to love one another cannot be sanitised by saying it is a call
to acting in loving ways. We are called to deep unity in love, to
brotherly love, to carrying one another&#39;s burdens. Look at the way Paul
describes this love in 1 Cor 13:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast,
it is not proud. It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking,
it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not
delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects,
always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not just intended for couples getting married! It is supposed to
describe leadership teams as well. This requires genuine friendship and
not just working relationships. It is totally unrealistic to suppose
that such love can exist where the only interaction is in dealing with
church administration. Leadership teams are an &amp;quot;artificial family&amp;quot; in
the sense that the people are brought together for leadership reasons
rather than natural friendship. But that does not excuse the team from
friendship. If the team truly believes that their first calling is to
lead by example in love for one another, before they can lead in any
other meaningful way, then forming trusting and accepting friendships
will be an early priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing openly about ourselves and listening carefully to what other say
to us within the leadership team is how love is established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jars-of-clay&#34;&gt;Jars of Clay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the more perplexing ways of God is that He purposely
hides His presence in unimpressive people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this
all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. We are hard pressed
on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;
persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. We
always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life
of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. (2 Cor 4:7-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Paul seems to be thinking about his vulnerability to oppressive
troubles such as the many unjust accusations he faced and the physical
beatings and difficult circumstances he endured. This seems incompatible
with the Gospel of the Kingdom announcing Jesus as the present ruling
King who had defeated and humiliated Satan. It is as if our experience
betrays the emptiness of our Gospel message. But that is how God intends
it to be! The Gospel is powerful because God is behind it, not because
Christians have trouble-free lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in this letter Paul tells us about another way he was
unimpressive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a
thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I
pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, &amp;ldquo;My
grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in
weakness.&amp;rdquo; Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my
weaknesses, so that Christ&amp;rsquo;s power may rest on me. (2 Cor 12:7-9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trouble that tormented Paul was to keep him from becoming
conceited, so I guess it was something that humiliated him; &amp;quot;my power
is made perfect in weakness&amp;quot;. Perhaps it was an obsessive temptation or
weakness that he succumbed to. Whatever it was, God in His wisdom
allowed it to continue, even though humanly speaking it weakened Paul&#39;s
witness. Paul was ashamed of it but God saw it as a protection from
conceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to accept, and celebrate, that God is pleased to hide His
treasure in jars of clay. We do not need to pretend to God or anyone
else that we are better than we are. We are objects of His grace as well
as His love. Although we strive to become more Christ-like, God is
perfectly content to work through our flawed characters. We must
therefore also accept each other as we are, because Christ has accepted
us as we are (Eph 4:32).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening-to-one-another&#34;&gt;Listening to One Another&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers 22:21-34 tells us the amusing story of Balaam and his talking
donkey. It is very instructive for leaders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the
Moabite officials.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balaam (like many leaders) had got his mission fixed in his head and he
was not going to be distracted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the Lord stood
in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his
two servants were with him. When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord
standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it turned off the
road into a field. Balaam beat it to get it back on the road.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balaam was so sure of where he was going, that he forgot to listen or
look out for God&#39;s direction. Although his donkey could see the angel,
Balaam could not! Balaam (like many leaders) assumed that anything or
anyone who hindered his progress was wrong, and needed correcting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God was patient and merciful towards Balaam and gave him multiple
chances to recognise that God was trying to speak to him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path through the
vineyards, with walls on both sides. When the donkey saw the angel of
the Lord, it pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam&amp;rsquo;s foot against
it. So he beat the donkey again. Then the angel of the Lord moved on
ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn,
either to the right or to the left. When the donkey saw the angel of
the Lord, it lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat it with
his staff.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Balaam pushed on ahead with his own plans, ignoring the unusual
behaviour of his faithful donkey. Because Balaam would not listen to the
&amp;quot;promptings of the Spirit&amp;quot; God spoke loud and clear through the
donkey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then the Lord opened the donkey&amp;rsquo;s mouth, and it said to Balaam,
&amp;ldquo;What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because it was only his donkey who spoke, and not some equally great
&amp;quot;man of God&amp;quot;, Balaam dismissed the donkey&#39;s talk as stupid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Balaam answered the donkey, &amp;ldquo;You have made a fool of me! If only I
had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to be prepared to listen to donkeys! Even though someone may
seem insignificant to us, God may be trying to speak to us through them!
We must always be listening out for God, no matter who or how He may
choose to speak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The donkey said to Balaam, &amp;ldquo;Am I not your own donkey, which you have
always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to
you?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; he said.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for Balaam, God was persistent enough to overcome Balaam&#39;s
stupidity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then the Lord opened Balaam&amp;rsquo;s eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord
standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell
facedown.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of a leader do you want to be? A dangerous and stupid leader
like Balaam who would not listen when God spoke through his donkey? Or
will you be someone who really listens to others, no matter who they
are? Are you ready to hear God speak through children? unbelievers?
sinners? people you disagree with? people you don&#39;t much like? people
you think have bad theology or are living a bad example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not about whether &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are worthy enough to speak to you, but
whether &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are you humble enough to let God speak to you any way He
chooses? Do you care enough about God&#39;s Kingdom to keep listening for
His still small voice even after you have set out on your journey?
Leaders must learn to listen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planning-a-leadership-team-meeting&#34;&gt;Planning a Leadership Team Meeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership team meetings, like all meetings, must be worthwhile. People
have to make time for them and travel to the meeting place &amp;ndash; both of
which might be very inconvenient. And yet there is a plague of worthless
meetings in the global church! It is called meetingitis and it is more
painful than appendicitis. One person defined leader&#39;s meetings as a
room full of people waiting to go home! I once stopped a Sunday church
service because it was a waste of time &amp;ndash; and I wish I had done it more
often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not looking forward to meeting, then probably no one else is
either, so do something about it. Either find a meaningful purpose or
stop the meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you plan a meaningful leaders meeting? Well let&#39;s list some
meaningful purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring and agreeing the purpose of the team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agreeing the parameters of the team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaningful relationships&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honesty, acceptance, listening, learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop &amp;quot;red-herrings&amp;quot; before they escape&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to and obeying Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing and promoting diversity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing ministry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning from existing ministry and improving it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopping or changing ineffective ministry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing new areas of ministry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting each other where help is needed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing God stories and motivating each other to keep pursuing God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring areas of teaching that could really help the church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss popular beliefs or teaching that is considered unhelpful to
the church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing what Jesus is saying to each member of the team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning to plant churches and release leadership ministry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be enough there to help you plan for some really worthwhile
meetings. But unless you plan the meetings they may still be frustrating
and fruitless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips to reduce the chances of a frustrating and fruitless
meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure everyone knows the date, time and place well ahead of the
meeting day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure everyone knows the purpose of the meeting well ahead of
the meeting day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appoint a good chairman &amp;ndash; not necessarily the lead-leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t waste time on formalities, such as reading and approving
reports and minutes. They should be distributed and read beforehand,
and only &amp;quot;matters arising&amp;quot; brought up in the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid doing any business in the meeting that can be done just as
well with fewer people outside the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop &amp;quot;red herrings&amp;quot; getting away. Don&#39;t let side-issues distract
the conversation from the main point being considered. This is
firstly the responsibility of the chairman, but everyone should
share this responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that decisions are made clearly, recorded accurately and
responsibility for action delegated effectively. Decisions that are
made and not acted on are a prime cause of frustration and wasted
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is going to be a social part to the meeting, have it at the
end and allow people to leave if they need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-things-to-think-about&#34;&gt;Some things to think about&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of people would you like to have in your ideal leadership
team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who do you know that you would like to share leadership with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you like to do in your first five ideal leadership team
meetings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pairs, find out the significant ways in which the other person has
grown as a disciple of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore with them how you can benefit from their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What steps can you take to improve your leadership-team meeting
experience?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-good-news-of-the-kingdom-of-god&#34;&gt;The good news of the kingdom of God:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-starts-with-healing&#34;&gt;It starts with Healing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 4:23; Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their
synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every
disease and sickness among the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-proclaims-the-good-news-of-the-kingdom&#34;&gt;It proclaims the &amp;ldquo;good news of the kingdom&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;heaven is coming to earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the curse is reversed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people are reconciled to God&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sins are forgiven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the possessed are set free&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jn 8:31-36 &amp;ldquo;If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of
Mine; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;hellip; Jesus answered them, &amp;ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who
commits sin is the slave of sin. &amp;hellip; So if the Son makes you free, you
will be free indeed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John 11:25 Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life. The
one who believes in me will live, even though they die;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 14:6 Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;I am the way, and the truth, and the life;
no one comes to the Father but through Me.&lt;/p&gt;

for many for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 53:5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for
our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by
his wounds we are healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 53:10 Yet it was the Lord&amp;rsquo;s will to crush him and cause him to
suffer, and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin, he will
see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the Lord will
prosper in his hand. After he has suffered, he will see the light of
life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will
justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scriptures&#34;&gt;Scriptures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 4:23; Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their
synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every
disease and sickness among the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 9:35; Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in
their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing
every disease and sickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between these two quotes, Matthew inserts the sermon on the mount
(5-7) and the bulk of the healings he records. (a leper, the centurions
servant, Peter&amp;rsquo;s mother-in-law, Many demon-possessed and all who were
sick, calms the storm, two demon-possessed men, a paralytic, girl raised
from the dead, woman with issue of blood, two blind and a mute.) After
this comes teaching about discipleship including the parables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 10:7-8 &amp;ldquo;And as you go, preach, saying, &amp;lsquo;The kingdom of heaven is
at hand.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out
demons. Freely you received, freely give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark 1:14-15  Now after John had been taken into custody, Jesus came
into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and saying, &amp;ldquo;The time is
fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the
gospel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 4:18-19 &amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed
me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom
for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the
oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 4:43; But he said, &amp;quot;I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom
of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 7:22 So he replied to the messengers, &amp;quot;Go back and report to John
what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk,
those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised,
and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 8:1; After this, Jesus travelled about from one town and village to
another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve
were with him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 9:2 And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to
perform healing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 61, &amp;ldquo;preach good news to the poor&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pauls-gospel&#34;&gt;Paul&amp;rsquo;s Gospel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 8:12 But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news
of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized,
both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Cor 15:1-5 Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I
preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by
which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to
you&amp;mdash;unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all
that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to
the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third
day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by
the twelve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul preached the Gospel of the Kingdom. The following passages all
refer to the Paul:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in
the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the
kingdom of God (Acts 14:22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three
months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of
God (Acts 19:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching
the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more (Acts 20:25).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his
lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God,
persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out
of the prophets, from morning till evening (Acts 28:23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all
that came in unto him, Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those
things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man
forbidding him (Acts 28:30-31).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;justified-by-faith&#34;&gt;Justified by faith:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 18:9&amp;ndash;14 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and
looked down on everyone else Jesus told this parable: &amp;ldquo;Two men went up
to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The
Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: &amp;lsquo;God, I thank you that I am not
like other people&amp;mdash;robbers, evildoers, adulterers&amp;mdash;or even like this
tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;But
the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to
heaven, but beat his breasts and said, &amp;lsquo;God, have mercy on me, a
sinner.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home
justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be
humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a morally upright man, he kept the commandments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 12: &amp;ldquo;I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.&amp;rdquo; These
are what you might call &amp;ldquo;religious&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ceremonial&amp;rdquo; acts: fasting and
tithing. &amp;ndash; a religiously devout man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he believed that this righteousness was the gift of God. Verse 11: &amp;ldquo;The
Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: &amp;lsquo;God, I thank you that I am
not like other men.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is not whether the man himself has produced the
righteousness he has or whether God has produced it. The problem is: He
trusts in it. This is his confidence. Verse 9: &amp;ldquo;[Jesus] also told this
parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous.&amp;rdquo; Now
make sure you see what this is saying. It is not saying that he is
trusting in himself to make himself righteous. No. He says explicitly he
is thanking God for that. He is not trusting in himself to make himself
righteous. He is trusting in himself that he is righteous with the
righteousness that he believes God has worked in him. That is what he is
trusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to justification &amp;mdash; for that is the issue, as verse 14
shows &amp;mdash; this man was trusting in the wrong thing. He was looking at
the wrong basis for his righteousness before God. He was looking at the
wrong ground for his righteousness before God. He was looking at the
wrong person and the wrong righteousness. He was looking to his own
righteousness &amp;mdash; and it was his, not because he created it, but because
he acted it. It was not an alien righteousness. It was inherent in him.
It was in his will and in his heart and in his actions. It was his, and
it was put there, he believed, by God. That is what he was trusting in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is not presented as a legalist &amp;mdash; one who tries to earn his
salvation. That is not the issue. One thing is the issue: This man was
morally upright. He was religiously devout. He believed God had made him
so. He gave thanks for it. And that is what he looked to and trusted in
for his justifying righteousness before God &amp;mdash; for his justification.
And he was dead wrong to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;christ-our-righteousness&#34;&gt;Christ our Righteousness&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;God made Christ to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might
become the righteousness of God&amp;rdquo; (2 Corinthians 5:21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By trusting Christ alone, we are united to him. And because we are &amp;ldquo;in
him,&amp;rdquo; what he is counts for us, his righteousness, his morality, his
devoutness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philippians 3:9;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 3:28; 4:4-6; 5:18&amp;ndash;19; 10:3&amp;ndash;4;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 1:30;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 2:16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settle it once and for all that the dozens of places in the Bible that
make your good behavior the condition of your final salvation are a
condition only as the fruit and confirmation of justification, not the
ground of it. If you do not settle this, you will live in continual
turmoil wondering what all those texts mean that say to Christians:
&amp;ldquo;Those who do such things will not enter the kingdom of heaven&amp;rdquo; (1
Corinthians 6:9). Don&amp;rsquo;t submit to that torment. Settle it. All the good
that God requires of the justified is the fruit of justification by
faith alone, never the ground of justification. Let the battle of your
life be there. The battle to believe. Not the battle to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says of those who are transformed in this way: &amp;ldquo;Then the righteous
will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father&amp;rdquo; (Matthew
13:43).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-real-kingdom&#34;&gt;A real Kingdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man
sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit
on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel&amp;rdquo; (Matthew 19:28;
see also Luke 22:28-30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After God resurrected Jesus from the dead, the disciples had a burning
question for Him: &amp;ldquo;Therefore, when they had come together, they asked
Him, saying, &amp;lsquo;Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to
Israel?&amp;rsquo; And He said to them, &amp;lsquo;It is not for you to know times or
seasons which the Father has put in His own authority&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; (Acts 1:6-7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They obviously understood that a part of Jesus&amp;rsquo; mission involved a
restoration of a literal kingdom, with Christ as ruler and the disciples
reigning under Him. Jesus told them, however, that the timing of the
establishing of that kingdom is known only to God the Father (Matthew
24:36).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/image1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;https://lifehopeandtruth.com/uploads/images/discern/2014_5/cvc_infographic.jpg&#34;&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;6.268055555555556in&amp;rdquo;

&lt;p&gt;(Acts 8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31). The members of the early
Church also put their focus on the coming Kingdom (Colossians 4:11; 2
Thessalonians 1:5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gospel Jesus Preached&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel Jesus preached was not a message about His person. He did not
go about Galilee and Judea relating all the things He had done. Rather,
He proclaimed a specific message from God the Father. The Apostle Peter
stated: &amp;ldquo;The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) That word, I say, ye know,
which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after
the baptism which John preached&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Acts%2010.36-37&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Acts
10:36-37]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). The
message Jesus brought was from the Father. It was sent to the children
of Israel and was the fulfillment of a prophecy given in the book of
Malachi. &amp;ldquo;Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way
before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his
temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold,
he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mal.%203.1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Mal.
3:1]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). John the Baptist
was the messenger who prepared the way.&lt;br&gt;
Jesus Christ was the divine Messenger-the Messenger of The Covenant. The
message Jesus brought-the Gospel-is the New Covenant message. Moses was
the mediator of the Old Covenant, but Jesus Christ is the mediator of
the New. The message Jesus brought is the New Testament Gospel. Mark
tells us when this Gospel began: &amp;ldquo;The beginning of the gospel of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mark%201.1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Mark
1:1]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). John first came
preaching the baptism of repentance. Then we read: &amp;ldquo;Now after that John
was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the
kingdom of God, And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of
God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mark%201.14-15&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Mark
1:14-15]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). The
Gospel Jesus brought is the one and only true Gospel. It was a message
about the Kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said the Gospel He preached came from the Father. He said, &amp;ldquo;. . .
I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a
commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that
his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even
as the Father said unto me, so I speak&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/John%2012.49-50&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[John
12:49-50]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). The
message sent from God the Father was the Good News of the Kingdom of
God. Jesus Christ was the Spokesman-the Word that was made flesh and
dwelt among us (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/John%201.14&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[John
1:14]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). His Gospel
ushered in an entirely new age. &amp;ldquo;The law and the prophets were until
John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man
presseth into it&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Luke%2016.16&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Luke
16:16]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus mentioned the Kingdom of God many times during His public
ministry. Notice a few examples: &amp;ldquo;And he said unto them, I must preach
the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Luke%204.43&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Luke 4:43]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;ldquo;And
Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their
synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every
sickness and every disease among the people&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Matt.%209.35&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Matt.
9:35]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;ldquo;But seek ye
first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things
shall be added unto you&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Matt.%206.33&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Matt.
6:33]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). In the Lord&amp;rsquo;s
Prayer He included the request that we pray, &amp;ldquo;Thy kingdom come&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Matt.%206.10&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Matt.
6:10]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are There Many Gospels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About twenty years after the death and resurrection of Christ, the
Apostle Paul warned the Galatians: &amp;ldquo;I marvel that ye are so soon removed
from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would
pervert the gospel of Christ&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Gal.%201.6-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Gal.
1:6-7]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). What was
taking place is that the Gospel of Jesus Christ was being changed to a
gospel about Christ, and His message was lost in the confusion. Paul
warned: &amp;ldquo;But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other
gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Gal.%201.8-9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Gal.
1:8-9]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
Today, many people do not know what the Gospel is. Rather, they believe
a different gospel. They have lost sight of the Gospel of the Kingdom of
God. When Jesus began His ministry He made it clear that to be saved it
was necessary to believe the Gospel. His words were: &amp;ldquo;. . . The time is
fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the
gospel&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mark%201.15&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Mark 1:15]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).
His parting words of instruction to His apostles were: &amp;ldquo;. . . Go ye into
all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that
believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not
shall be damned&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mark%2016.15-16&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Mark
16:15-16]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). The
apostles were commissioned to preach the Gospel. This Gospel was not a
message about the Person of Christ; it was the message about the coming
Kingdom of God.&lt;br&gt;
This was the same message the Apostle Paul preached. Notice the
following passages. They all refer to the Apostle Paul:&lt;br&gt;
Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in
the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the
kingdom of God (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Acts%2014.22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Acts
14:22]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three
months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of
God (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Acts%2019.8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Acts 19:8]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching
the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Acts%2020.25&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Acts
20:25]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his
lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God,
persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out
of the prophets, from morning till evening (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Acts%2028.23&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Acts
28:23]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all
that came in unto him, Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those
things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man
forbidding him (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Acts%2028.30-31&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Acts
28:30-31]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
There are not many gospels; there is only one true gospel-the Gospel of
the Kingdom of God! This was the message that was consistently taught by
Christ, by the apostles and New Testament evangelists (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Acts%208.12&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Acts
8:12]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;), and by the
Apostle Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Does the Word &amp;ldquo;Kingdom&amp;rdquo; Mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was not talking about something that was within the heart of man,
nor was He talking about a church. He was talking about a literal
kingdom. Any dictionary will tell you that a kingdom is a major
territorial unit which has a monarchical form of government with a king
or queen as its head. A kingdom consists of four things: (1) a king or
head of state; (2) territory over which to rule; (3) laws by which to
govern; and (4) subjects over which to rule. All of these requirements
will be met when Jesus returns to establish His kingdom on this earth.
Notice what the prophets foretold:&lt;br&gt;
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government
shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful,
Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon
the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish
it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The
zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Isa.%209.6-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Isa.
9:6-7]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came
with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they
brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and
glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should
serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass
away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. . . . And the
kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole
heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High,
whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve
and obey him (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Dan.%207.13-14&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Dan.
7:13-14]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Dan%207.27&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[27]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
And out of his [Christ&amp;rsquo;s] mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he
should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and
he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF
KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Rev.%2019.15-16&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Rev.
19:15-16]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
The angel told His mother Mary: &amp;ldquo;And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be
great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God
shall give unto him the throne of his father David&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Luke%201.31-32&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Luke
1:31-32]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). When
Jesus was asked by Pilate if He was a king, &amp;ldquo;. . . Jesus answered, Thou
sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came
I into the world. . . &amp;quot; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/John%2018.37&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[John
18:37]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
Jesus Christ will return to this earth to establish a literal
kingdom-the Kingdom of God. Few people today seem to realize this aspect
of Christ&amp;rsquo;s work. Many seem to believe that the Kingdom of God could not
apply to this time of grace. In effect, they reject the Good News of the
Kingdom of God; they do not believe the true Gospel! They refuse to
believe in the coming wonderful world tomorrow. The Bible describes this
coming time.&lt;br&gt;
And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the
LORD&amp;rsquo;S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall
be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many
people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of
the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his
ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the
law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among
the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their
swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall
not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Isa.%202.2-4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Isa. 2:2-4]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditions for Entering the Kingdom of God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God. How may we enter
into this marvelous kingdom? Jesus&#39; instruction was, &amp;ldquo;repent and believe
the Gospel&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mark%201.15&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Mark
1:15]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus gave us
two things to do. We must repent, and we must believe the Gospel.
Believing the Gospel means we must also believe on Jesus Christ, the
King of the coming Kingdom of God. He is not only our King, but our
personal Saviour and great High Priest. Repentance means there has been
a change of mind and heart in each individual who has accepted Christ.
Accepting Christ as personal Savior means we recognize that Christ died
for us, and that we must repent of wrong doing-of sin. To repent means
to change the mind with respect to the Law of God; this change of mind
leads to a change of life. We must repent of sin. What is sin? The Bible
tells us: &amp;ldquo;Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin
is the transgression of the law&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/1%20John%203.4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[1 John
3:4]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). Sin is the
violation of the Law of God-the Ten Commandments. Jesus was once asked,
&amp;ldquo;. . . Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal
life?&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;. . . if thou wilt enter into life, keep the
commandments&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Matt.%2019.16-17&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Matt.
19:16-17]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus
went on to explain that He was referring to the Ten Commandments.&lt;br&gt;
The Ten Commandments summarize how to live right in the eyes of God.
They show us how to manifest love to God and toward our fellow man. They
show, in principle, the whole duty of living righteously. They show a
way of life that leads to happiness, peace of mind, and joy. They show a
manner of living that is contrary to human nature and to the customs and
ways of this world. They show the way to eternal life. Jesus said these
two principles are necessary for us to do in order to enter the Kingdom
of God-repent and believe the Gospel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spiritual Birth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicodemus, a Pharisee and leader of the Jews, came to Christ at night.
Jesus told him, &amp;ldquo;. . . Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be
born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/John%203.3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[John
3:3]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). Jesus emphasized
the Kingdom of God and told Nicodemus the most important aspect he
needed to know in order to enter into that kingdom. Jesus said that
unless one is born again he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. What
did He mean? Nicodemus, bewildered, asked, &amp;ldquo;. . . How can a man be born
when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother&amp;rsquo;s womb, and
be born?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/John%203.4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[John 3:4]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).
Nicodemus knew Jesus was talking about a literal birth. Jesus went on to
explain: &amp;ldquo;. . . Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of
water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That
which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born
again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so
is every one that is born of the Spirit&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/John%203.5-8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[John
3:5-8]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). So, those
born of the flesh are flesh, but those born of the spirit are spirit.
The Apostle Paul said: &amp;ldquo;Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood
cannot inherit the kingdom of God. . . &amp;quot; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/1%20Cor.%2015.50&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[1 Cor.
15:50]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). The birth
Jesus was talking about was the change from flesh to spirit-the change
from mortality to immortality. Jesus was talking about the resurrection
of the dead.&lt;br&gt;
Paul spoke of the resurrection. He said this of the physical body:&lt;br&gt;
. . . It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: It is sown
in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is
raised in power: It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual
body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. . . . Now
this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a
mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet
shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be
changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
must put on immortality (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/1%20Cor.%2015.42-44&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[1 Cor.
15:42-44]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/1%20Cor%2015.50-53&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[50-53]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
Jesus instructed Nicodemus that it is possible to be born again, not as
a mortal flesh-and-blood baby, but as immortal spirit. Jesus said, God
is a Spirit (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/John%204.24&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[John
4:24]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). The Kingdom of
God will be made up of those who are born of the Spirit. God created man
in His own image-physically. Upon conversion-true repentance and belief
in Christ- man receives only a measure of the Holy Spirit. In the
resurrection those truly converted will be changed into spirit by that
very Spirit dwelling in them. Paul wrote: &amp;ldquo;But if the Spirit of him that
raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
dwelleth in you&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Rom.%208.11&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Rom.
8:11]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). Man, now
created physically in God&amp;rsquo;s image, is in the process of being created
into His image spiritually (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/1%20Cor.%2015.49&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[1 Cor.
15:49]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/2%20Cor%203.18&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[2 Cor
3:18]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Col.%203.10&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Col.
3:10]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). Paul makes
plain that while flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, yet
by means of the resurrection those begotten by the Holy Spirit in this
mortal life can, and will be, changed into immortality to be like God
Himself (&lt;a href=&#34;https://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/1%20John%203.2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[1 John
3:2]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;). This is the
birth Jesus spoke of-the spiritual birth into the Kingdom of God. This
is what the Gospel is all about!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dying</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/healing/dying/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/healing/dying/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;spirit-of-life&#34;&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extract from &amp;quot;We make the road by walking&amp;quot;, Brian McLaren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philippians 1:20-30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s many essential movements in our lives is this: to
prepare us for the end of our lives, without fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many us are afraid to even think about death, much less speak of it.
That fear can enslave us and can rob us of so much aliveness. The Spirit
moves within us to help us face death with hope, not fear . . . with
quiet confidence, not anxiety &amp;lsquo;The law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus,&amp;rsquo; Paul said (Rom. 8:2), &amp;lsquo;has set you free from the law of sin and
of death.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a way to think about death. We often speak of God as the one who
was, who is, and who is to come. The God who was holds all our past. The
God who is surrounds us now. And the God who is to come will be there
for us beyond this life as we know it. With that realisation in mind,
death could never mean leaving God, because there is nowhere we can
escape from God&amp;rsquo;s presence, as the psalmist said (139:7). Instead, death
simply means leaving the presence of God in this little neighbourhood of
history called the present. Through death, we join God in the vast,
forever-expanding future, into which both past and present are forever
taken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death is merely a doorway, a passage from one way of living in God&amp;rsquo;s
presence in the present to another way of living in God&amp;rsquo;s presence - in
the open space of unseized possibility we call the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be liberated from the fear of death &amp;mdash; think of how that would
change your values, perspectives and actions. To believe that no good
thing is lost, but that all goodness will be taken up and consummated in
God &amp;mdash; think of how that frees you to do good without reservation. To
participate in a network of relationships that isn&amp;rsquo;t limited by death in
the slightest degree &amp;mdash; think of how that would make every person
matter and how it would free you to live with boundless, loving
aliveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what might we expect to happen when we die? Nobody knows for sure,
but in light of Jesus&#39; death and resurrection, we can expect to
experience death as a passage, like birth, the end of one life stage and
the beginning of another. We don&amp;rsquo;t know how that passing will come ...
like a slow slipping away in disease like a sudden jolt or shock in an
accident. However it happens, we can expect to discover that we&amp;rsquo;re not
falling out of life, but deeper into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, we can expect to experience as never before the
unimaginable light or energy of God&amp;rsquo;s presence. We will enter into a
goodness so good, a richness so rich, a holiness so holy, a mercy and
love so strong and true that all of our evil, pride, lust, greed,
resentment and fear will be instantly melted out of us. We will at that
moment more fully understand how much we have been forgiven, and so we
will more than ever be filled with love... love for God who forgives,
and with God, love for everyone and everything that has like us been
forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can expect to feel a sense of reunion &amp;mdash; yes, with loved ones who
have died, but also with our great-great-great-great-grand- parents and
our thirty-second cousins a thousand times removed whose names we&amp;rsquo;ve
never known but to whom we are in fact related. That sense of
relatedness that we now feel with closest of kin will somehow be
expanded to every person who has ever lived. And that sense of
relatedness won&amp;rsquo;t stop with human beings, but will expand infinitely
outwards to all of God&amp;rsquo;s creation. We can expect to feel the fullest,
most exquisite sense of oneness and inter-relatedness and harmony - a
sense of belonging and connection that we approached only vaguely or
clumsily in our most ecstatic moments in this life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can expect to feel differently about our sufferings. We will see not
the short-term pain that so preoccupied us on the past side of death,
but instead the enduring virtue, courage and compassion that have been
forged in us through each fall of the hammer on the anvil of pain. So we
will bless our sufferings and feel about them as we feel about our
pleasures now. What has been suffered or lost will feel weightless
compared to the substance that has been gained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can expect to feel a limitless sense of &amp;lsquo;Ah yes, now I see&amp;rsquo;. What we
longed for, reached for, touched but couldn&amp;rsquo;t grasp, and knew in part
will then be so clear. And all our unfulfilled longing on this side of
death will, we can expect, enrich and fulfil the having on that side of
death. We can expect to feel as if we&amp;rsquo;re waking up from being half
asleep, waking into an explosion of pure, utter gratitude as we suddenly
and fully realise all we&amp;rsquo;ve had and taken for granted all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may imagine that dying will be like diving or falling or stepping
into a big wave at the beach. You will feel yourself lifted off your
feet and taken up into a swirl and curl and spin more powerful than you
can now imagine. But there will be no fear, because the motion and flow
will be the dance of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The rising tide will
be life and joy. The undertow will be love, and you will be drawn deeper
and deeper in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We normally don&amp;rsquo;t look forward to the process of dying, and most of us
would be happy if the dying process is as short and painless as
possible. But if we allow the Spirit to prepare us for dying by
contemplating it in these ways, we can begin to under-stand the dual
pull that Paul wrote about: &amp;lsquo;For me to live is Christ but to die is
gain.&amp;rsquo; On the one hand, we feel a pull to stay here in this life,
enjoying the light and love and goodness of God with so many people who
are dear to us, with so much good work left to be done. On the other
hand, we feel an equal and opposite pull towards the light and love and
goodness of God experienced more directly beyond this life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us remember the experience as children of &amp;lsquo;waiting your turn&amp;rsquo;;
Maybe it was waiting your turn to ride a pony at the county fair, or
waiting your turn to play a game, or waiting your turn to ride a sled
down a hill in winter snow. Imagine the feeling of having had your turn
on this Earth and having enjoyed it thoroughly. Now you are ready to
step aside to let someone else have their turn. In that way, even dying
can be an act of love and generosity: vacating space to make room for
others, especially generations as yet unborn, just as others vacated
their space so you could have your turn in this life. Perhaps the act of
letting others have their turn will be one of our most mature and
generous actions a fitting end to our adventure in this life. At that
moment, it will be our turn to graduate into a new adventure, beyond all
imagining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we walk this road, we not only remember the past, we also anticipate
the future, which is described as a great banquet around God&amp;rsquo;s table of
joy. When you pass from this life, do not be afraid. You will not pass
into death. You will pass through death into a greater aliveness still
&amp;mdash; the banquet of God. Trust God, and live.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Elders and Apostles</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/elders-and-apostles/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/elders-and-apostles/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;elders-and-apostles&#34;&gt;Elders and Apostles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NT church leadership consists of Jesus the head, elders/leaders and the
saints, who are the foot-soldiers of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul instructed Titus to appoint elders over the churches in his care.
It is the New Testament norm for local churches to have one or more
elders to care for it. But Paul warns not to appoint novice believers
who lack maturity in their faith. The reason is that young believers are
often eager to become elders because of the esteem it gives them. But
Jesus shows us the true heart of an elder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them,
because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd.&amp;rdquo;
(Matt 9:36)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the
Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which
He purchased with His own blood. (Acts 20:28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elder should be a believer with a heart broken for the lost; moved
with compassion for the captives and passionate about Jesus. Such a
person is likely to lead a healthy church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to elders, God gives &amp;lsquo;gifts&amp;rsquo; of apostles, prophets,
teachers, evangelists and pastors to help equip the church for ministry
(Eph 4). Although the NT does not make clear how these ministries
related to the local church and mission, it seems that the 5-fold gifts
spear-head and motivate church planting and lay the foundations of truth
and practice for churches. Meanwhile, the elders/leaders and saints get
on with the task of discipling and multiplying. No doubt some churches
had resident ministry gifts whilst others received input from visiting
ministries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;An elder is a man who is called and gifted by God, who with other
elders has the responsibility for leading a local church. Scripture
portrays him as a man who is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaped by apostolic ministry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Able to lead himself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Able to lead his family&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Able to lead his local church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elder is responsible for the day-to-day discipleship of the church
and is rightly concerned with the details of individual&amp;rsquo;s lives and the
particular challenges and delights of living out the Kingdom in the
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-control is the preeminent qualification for eldership and is the
only thing Paul tells Timothy to teach young men! Learning to lead
yourself is the key preparation necessary to lead others. If young
people can win this battle early, then they will develop into fine
leaders.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devil lays snares for elders! Every potential elder must honestly
ask himself where his weak spots are. Where will the devil lay his
snare? Pride is a common snare, but there may be others. Do not appoint
elders hastily; examine their character and the fruit of their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elder should not be a novice, lest being puffed up with pride he fall
into the same condemnation as the devil. Moreover he must have a good
testimony among those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and
the snare of the devil. (1Tim 3:6-7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elders should be transparent. What you see is what you get. Their &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;
means &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; and their &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo; means &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo;. Elders and deacons need to be
people of pure hearts and open spirits whom you know you can trust. If
they have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, do not
entrust them with true riches.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he
who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much. Therefore if you
have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to
your trust the true riches?&amp;rdquo; (Lk 16:10-11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elders must honour the priesthood of all believers and should therefore
always seek the counsel and mind of those they lead and involve them in
the process of decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry gifts, especially the apostles and prophets, are called to
have a bigger vision and wider perspective on what is happening. There
tends to be a healthy tension between elders who want to strengthen
their local work with more leaders, and the apostles who want to push
those leaders out into new works. In addition, apostles and prophets are
more likely to see the foundational significance of certain events and
how they are responded to. This produces another healthy tension between
the pragmatism of an elder and the relative idealism of an apostle or
prophet. It is not that one is right and the other wrong, but that both
voices and influences are needed. The elder has the God given
responsibility to lead and care. The ministry gifts have the
responsibility to provoke. For this reason elders need to be continually
envisioned and equipped by apostles and their teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers will have particular gifting in understanding the breadth of
truth in the scriptures, providing doctrinal perspective and balance.
They help to reveal simple truths that so easily get obscured by
tradition or worldly thinking. They help the saints to gain the
confidence to search the scriptures for themselves and take both the
meat and the milk of the word. They will not promote their own wisdom
with new interpretations, but appeal to the simplicity of the gospel and
the witness of the Spirit to bring clarity to the scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ephesians 4 Ministries</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/ephesians-4-ministries/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/ephesians-4-ministries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ephesians-4-ministries&#34;&gt;Ephesians 4 Ministries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists,
the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so
that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in
the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature,
attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. (Ephesians
4:11-13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apostles&#34;&gt;Apostles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus the apostle: &amp;quot;Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby
villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.&amp;quot; (Mk
1:38)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus commanded us to &amp;ldquo;go and make disciples of all nations&amp;rdquo; (Matt
28:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apostles are the boots of the church, keeping us moving, going to new
places, preventing the church becoming a tree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prophets&#34;&gt;Prophets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus the prophet: &amp;ldquo;For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who
sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken. I know that his
command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father
has told me to say.&amp;rdquo; (John 12:49-50)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus commanded us to listen to Him: &amp;ldquo;My sheep hear my voice, and I know
them, and they follow me.&amp;rdquo; (John 10:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophets are the head-phones of the church, helping us hear and follow
Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;evangelists&#34;&gt;Evangelists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus the Evangelist: &amp;ldquo;For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the
lost&amp;rdquo; (Lk 19:10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus commands that we go and heal the sick: &amp;ldquo;Heal the sick, raise the
dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have
received; freely give.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangelists are the stethoscope of the church, helping us listen to
people&#39;s diseased souls so we can prescribe Jesus, the cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pastors&#34;&gt;Pastors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus the pastor: &amp;ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in
me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do
nothing. ... If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask
whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. ... As the Father has
loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 15:5-9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus told Peter to &amp;ldquo;Feed my lambs ... Take care of my sheep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastors are the food-bucket of the church. They attract us to the good
pasture of the Word of God and His healing presence, saying, &amp;ldquo;Come on!
Here is food for your soul.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;teachers&#34;&gt;Teachers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus the teacher: &amp;ldquo;When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming
toward him, he said to Philip, &amp;ldquo;Where shall we buy bread for these
people to eat?&amp;rdquo; He asked this only to test him, for he already had in
mind what he was going to do. (Jn 6:5-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus commands us to apprentice disciples: &amp;ldquo;teach them to obey
everything I have commanded you.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 28:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers are the aprons of the church, they say, &amp;ldquo;come on, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you
how to do it...&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-head&#34;&gt;The Head&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus gives apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers to the
church, but which of these is the leader?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the same as saying &amp;ldquo;Jesus gives boots, ear-phones, stethoscope,
food-bucket and aprons to the church. Which of these is the leader?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a stupid question. They are all gifts to help the church &amp;ldquo;build
itself up in love, as each part does its work&amp;rdquo;. If you give someone a
gift to help them, the gift does not take control! The head is always
the leader. The body&amp;rsquo;s proper functioning is the point. The gifts are
simply aids for the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him
who is the head, that is, Christ.  From him the whole body, joined and
held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up
in love, as each part does its work. (Ephesians 4:15-16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-foundation&#34;&gt;The Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in Ephesians (2:20) Paul says that the Church is &amp;quot;built on the
foundation of the apostles and prophets&amp;quot;. Proponents of &amp;quot;Apostolic&amp;quot;
ministry have taken this to argue that local churches must be
established by apostolic and prophetic ministry and should continue to
have apostolic and prophetic oversite. But this is nothing to do with
what Paul is saying. We must read this in its context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eph 2:14-22 For he himself ... has made the two groups (Jews and
Gentiles) one and has destroyed the dividing wall of hostility ...
His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two,
... and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the
cross, ... Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers,
but fellow citizens with God&amp;rsquo;s people ... &lt;strong&gt;built on the foundation
of the apostles and prophets&lt;/strong&gt;, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief
cornerstone...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eph 3:4-6 You will be able to understand my insight into the mystery
of Christ, which ... has now been revealed by the Spirit &lt;strong&gt;to God&amp;rsquo;s
holy apostles and prophets&lt;/strong&gt;. This mystery is that through the gospel
the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one
body...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophets Paul refers to are the New Testament prophets that
understood the significance of the Old Testament prophets who prophesied
that Abraham&#39;s blessing would be taken to the Gentiles. The apostles
are Peter and James and Paul and those other early apostles who
established from God that there was to be no divide between Jewish and
Gentile believers. Gentile inclusion into the People of God is the
foundation that has been laid and never needs to be re-laid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuing-the-ministry-gifts&#34;&gt;Valuing the Ministry-Gifts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders should be able to identify at least some of these gifts within
themselves and those in the leadership team. It is probably unhelpful to
label one another in this way, but recognising and promoting and valuing
these gifts is really important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of these gifts do you recognise in your team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which are less well represented?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your team lop-sided or well balanced?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you strengthen the weaker areas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you need to bring other people into the team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;faith-promises&#34;&gt;Faith Promises&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lk 15:31 &amp;ldquo;Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jn 14:12-15 &amp;ldquo;He who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also;
and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father. And
whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be
glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jn 16:23-24 &amp;ldquo;Whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you.
&amp;hellip; Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2Co 10:4-5 &amp;ldquo;For the weapons of our warfare are mighty in God for pulling
down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high thing that
exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into
captivity to the obedience of Christ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lk 7:23 &amp;ldquo;Blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.&amp;rdquo; (Do not
treasure up disappointments)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil 4:7 &amp;ldquo;And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will
guard your hearts and minds (against disappointment) through Christ
Jesus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 6:11 Reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ
Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jam 5:16 Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one
another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a
righteous man avails much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isa 53:3-5 By His stripes we are healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mk 16:17-18 &amp;ldquo;These signs will follow those who believe: In My name they
will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take
up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt
them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 8:37 &amp;ldquo;Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through
Him who loved us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jam 1:5-8 &amp;ldquo;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to
all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But let
him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of
the sea driven and tossed by the wind. For let not that man suppose that
he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man,
unstable in all his ways.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Pet 1:2-4 &amp;ldquo;Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of
God and of Jesus our Lord, as His divine power has given to us all
things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him
who called us by glory and virtue, by which have been given to us
exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be
partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in
the world through lust.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mk 11:23-24 &amp;ldquo;For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain,
&amp;lsquo;Be removed and be cast into the sea,&amp;rsquo; and does not doubt in his heart,
but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have
whatever he says. Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when
you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Cor 2:16 For who has known the mind of the LORD that he may instruct
Him? But we have the mind of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 15:13 &amp;ldquo;Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eph 3:20 &amp;ldquo;Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all
that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 13:5 He Himself has said, &amp;ldquo;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jn 10:10 &amp;ldquo;I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it
more abundantly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Jn 4:4 &amp;ldquo;You are of God, little children, and have overcome them,
because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handbook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love one another &amp;ndash; Go and make disciples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;How-to&lt;/em&gt; guide for Growth Groups. For biblical background and
more on the vision behind Growth Groups see &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Growth Groups -
Introduction for Leaders&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;love-one-another----go-and-make-disciples&#34;&gt;Love One another &amp;ndash; go and make disciples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus gave many commandments but there is one He gave special emphasis
to. He called it a &lt;em&gt;New Commandment&lt;/em&gt;. It was short and simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Love one another&amp;rdquo; (John 13:34).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last command Matthew records, known as the &lt;em&gt;Great Commission&lt;/em&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. &lt;strong&gt;Go
therefore and make disciples&lt;/strong&gt; of all the nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, &lt;strong&gt;teaching
them to observe all things that I have commanded you&lt;/strong&gt;; and lo, I am
with you always, even to the end of the age.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 28:18-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Groups are one of the simplest and most effective ways of
fulfilling the &lt;em&gt;New Commandment&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Great Commission&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;growth-group-principles&#34;&gt;Growth Group Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Groups are built upon five essential elements which Jesus says
discipleship depends upon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in Jesus&#39; Light&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing and Obeying Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal Relationship with Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeding on Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing Jesus Speak&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;living-in-jesus-light&#34;&gt;Living in Jesus&#39; Light&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disciple of Jesus is shaped and moulded by the radiant and penetrating
purity and righteousness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be
clearly seen, that they have been done in God.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 3:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have not discovered God&amp;rsquo;s truth in Jesus are afraid of the
light. They fear God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;interference&amp;rdquo; in their life; they fear the
exposure of their ungodly deeds; they fear condemnation of their
attitudes and motivations. On the other hand, those who know Jesus love
the light. They love His truth; they are confident in His love; they
rest in His forgiveness; they relish His affirmation as beloved children
of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving and living in God&amp;rsquo;s light is the starting point of discipleship.
Growth Groups depend upon openness with one another and openness to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;believing-and-obeying-jesus&#34;&gt;Believing and Obeying Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest statements Jesus makes about discipleship is that to
be a disciple we must both believe what He says and do what He commands;
there is no discipleship without obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 14:23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must grow in our obedience to His &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; teaching, but He also wants
us to grow in confidence in His promises, especially to do the works
that He did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I
have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these,
because I am going to the Father.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 14:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says that faith and obedience are the true measure of our love for
Him. Growth Groups therefore place faith and obedience to Jesus at their
heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;personal-relationship&#34;&gt;Personal Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as there is no discipleship without obedience, there can be no true
obedience without a personal loving relationship with Jesus. Obedience
flows from relationship, not knowledge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 14:23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people admire Jesus from afar. We can admire and seek to imitate
His example of love, we can be impressed by His insight into man&amp;rsquo;s
nature, we can enjoy reading the Gospels. We might even be a faithful
member of a church and devote our energies to loving others through acts
of kindness. But discipleship is a call to a relationship with Jesus
which bears the fruit of &lt;em&gt;intimacy&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. If you abide in me and I in you,
you will bear much fruit ... showing yourselves to be my disciples.&amp;rdquo;
(Jn 15:5,8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on intimacy and fruitfulness will be especially challenging as
we all fall so short of the relationship that Jesus models for us.
Nevertheless growth in our personal relationship with Jesus must be
placed at the heart of our Growth Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feeding-on-jesus&#34;&gt;Feeding on Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bible study and bible knowledge is commonly mistaken for discipleship,
but Jesus was clear that they are not the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them
you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify
about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 5:39-40)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us back to personal relationship. Without personal
relationship with Jesus all the study and knowledge in the world counts
for nothing. But neither can there be discipleship without bible study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 8:31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus calls us beyond bible study. He says we are to &lt;em&gt;abide&lt;/em&gt; in His
word. The NIV has &amp;ldquo;remain&amp;rdquo; instead of &lt;em&gt;abide&lt;/em&gt; (NKJV). I think &lt;em&gt;abide&lt;/em&gt;
conveys the sense better; it is where our home is, where we live, where
we draw life from. The way Jesus explains what He means by &lt;em&gt;abiding&lt;/em&gt; in
His word is with the imagery of food. He says we are to feed on Him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and
drink his blood, you have no life in you ... For my flesh is real
food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my
blood &lt;em&gt;abides&lt;/em&gt; in me, and I in them. (Jn 6:53-56)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we read and study the scriptures, we should do so to feast on
Jesus. We should think of it as eating a meal, not as gaining knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine inviting some friends for a meal, but instead of eating the
food, you simply discuss it. Perhaps you analyse its nutritional value
and discuss where and how it was grown. You might sample the various
foods and compare their tastes. You might come away much more
knowledgeable about the food and even recommend it to others. But you
have entirely missed the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, what if you &lt;em&gt;eat&lt;/em&gt; the meal? You might not be
conscious of the need your body has for Iron and Magnesium and Vitamin
B12. You might have no idea what happens to the food and how it helps
your body to grow and stay healthy. But eating it will still do you
good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how we should approach the Word of God, both in our personal
reading and in our Growth Group. Discussion of origins and meanings and
possible applications may well enhance our enjoyment of the meal, but
even where we have little understanding of the meaning and no knowledge
of how it can help us, it still does us good. God&amp;rsquo;s word, and especially
the Gospels, is food for the Holy Spirit to use in shaping our thinking
and nourishing our faith. If you do not yet know this to be true, you
will soon prove it for yourself as you share in your Growth Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to feed on Jesus is central to discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hearing-jesus-speak&#34;&gt;Hearing Jesus Speak&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised that prayer has not been included as one of the
essential ingredients of discipleship. Well, it has been, except that
the aspect of prayer Jesus tied to discipleship is not us speaking to
God (which even unbelievers do), but God speaking to us. Jesus said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My sheep hear My voice&amp;rdquo; (John 10:27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly every chapter of John&amp;rsquo;s Gospel shows us that Jesus heard the
Father&amp;rsquo;s voice and received His direction for life and ministry from
Him. Jesus teaches that hearing God is a mark of discipleship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words
that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.&amp;rdquo; (John 6:63)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He who is of God hears God&amp;rsquo;s words; therefore you do not hear,
because you are not of God.&amp;rdquo; (John 8:47)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary characteristics of the New Covenant is the giving of
the Holy Spirit so that we may be taught directly by Him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Holy
Spirit will not come to you; ... He will guide you into all the truth
... He will glorify me because he will receive from me and make it
known to you.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 16:7-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to God is one of the most important aspects of prayer for a
disciple. Yet some people find even the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of hearing Jesus
difficult. This is an area where we must exercise our faith and believe
what Jesus says, &amp;ldquo;My sheep hear My voice.&amp;rdquo; If you are a disciple and
have been baptised in His Holy Spirit then you hear His voice &amp;ndash; but you
might not have learnt to recognise it yet. God sometimes speaks to us
very strongly and clearly, but often He speaks to us in a still, small
voice and sometimes we only discern His voice gradually over a period of
weeks or months. He often uses a combination of methods including
scripture, our own thoughts and conversations with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Groups are designed to help you grow in confidence in discerning
what Jesus is saying to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;growth-group-practice&#34;&gt;Growth Group Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus made two great promises which are the foundation of the Growth
Group method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where two or three gather in my name, I am there with them (Matthew
18:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit of truth will guide you into all the truth. (John 16:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two or three friends, meeting together in confident faith that Jesus is
with them and the Holy Spirit will guide them, can join the growing
family of countless other such groups who experience the joy and
excitement of being discipled by Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Growth Group is a group of two or three people who meet regularly to
be discipled by Jesus. Only one of the members needs to be a Christian,
the others may be Christians or not-yet-Christians who are curious about
Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group meets once a week to learn from Jesus, love each other and
share in an adventure of faith. Through prayer, discussing and applying
scripture and through outreach the group will grow both in discipleship
and in numbers. To function well the members must be open and real with
one another, let the Holy Spirit teach them and be prepared to take
risks and learn from their mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;growth-group-distinctives&#34;&gt;Growth Group Distinctives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Growth Group is NOT just another name for a cell group, home group,
bible study group or prayer partner / triplet. The essential
distinctives of a Growth Group are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;no-more-than-three-members&#34;&gt;No more than three members&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Groups are limited to two or three members. Four is recommended
only for a short period before dividing into two groups. The reason is
that where there are four or more people, some can easily become
spectators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;each-growth-group-goes-at-its-own-pace&#34;&gt;Each Growth Group goes at its own pace&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each group is unique and should be free to choose what scripture they
read and at what pace they proceed through a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;it-does-not-require-a-leader&#34;&gt;It does not require a leader&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Groups depend upon the Holy Spirit to be the leader and
teacher. Growth Groups work well even with brand new Christians who
have no one to teach them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;it-is-not-a-prayer-group&#34;&gt;It is not a prayer group&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Groups pray, but prayer is not the focus; discipleship is. A
prayer group&amp;rsquo;s purpose has been fulfilled when you have prayed
together. A Growth Group&amp;rsquo;s purpose is fulfilled only by growing
obedience to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;it-is-not-a-bible-study&#34;&gt;It is not a bible study&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Groups study the bible, but bible knowledge and understanding
is not the focus; discipleship is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bible study asks &amp;ldquo;What does this passage mean&amp;rdquo; and usually requires
someone to lead and do some teaching, or books or study guides to
help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Growth Group asks &amp;ldquo;What is Jesus saying to me today.&amp;rdquo; Growth Groups
can benefit from bible study helps, but they are not dependent upon
them. The Holy Spirit will give understanding sufficient for the
obedience He is asking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;every-day-not-just-once-a-week&#34;&gt;Every day, not just once a week&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Growth Group will usually meet just once a week, it is
dependent upon each member having daily time with Jesus asking Him to
speak to them through that week&amp;rsquo;s bible passage. It is also dependent
upon daily prayer and obedience to the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;growth-groups-change&#34;&gt;Growth Groups change&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most other groups&#39; value stability and the members often stay together
for years. This is not the case with Growth Groups. The membership of
a healthy Growth Group will change as it reaches out to include new
people and then divides to observe the &amp;ldquo;no more than three&amp;rdquo; rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;growth-groups-are-allowed-to-fail&#34;&gt;Growth Groups are allowed to fail&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important that all members of a Growth Group know that it is
perfectly alright to stop. Indeed if you do not feel it is helping you
grow in obedience to Jesus then you should stop. It is better to seek
new partners for a group than to continue with a group that is not
growing. But you should not give up too soon. If you have not been in
a Growth Group before it may take up to 6 months before you really
begin to recognise how Jesus is teaching you and causing you to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus warned us that some people are poor soil; some will not want to
continue as a disciple of Jesus. Sadly we have to let them go rather
than have them hold others back. Growth groups are not suitable for
half-hearted Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-to-listening&#34;&gt;Learning to Listening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of a Growth Group must practice listening to one another and
listening to Jesus. Sharing about our most intimate relationship is
often difficult and can make us feel vulnerable. It is vital that we
listen carefully to each other. These guidelines will help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each member should be allowed to share without being interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not try to provide answers to one another&amp;rsquo;s problems; when
a person shares their heart, they want you to listen to them, not
fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions may be asked to help a person explore and express their
meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offer help only if invited to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, ordinary interactive discussion can follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Growth Group is not a competition for the deepest insights; it is
sitting together at Jesus&#39; feet. It is perfectly alright to say, &amp;ldquo;I
don&amp;rsquo;t understand this passage&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what Jesus might be
saying to me&amp;rdquo;. As we feed on Jesus and share the delights we are
enjoying with each other, we need to practice listening for Jesus&#39;
voice. The most important thing is that we encourage each other to keep
listening to Jesus in the confident assurance that His sheep hear His
voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-to-obey-jesus&#34;&gt;Learning to Obey Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus told us to make disciples who obey all He commanded. This is the
focus of Growth Groups from day one, even if some members are not yet
saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day of the week you read an agreed portion of scripture on your own
(or with a friend if your reading is poor). Remember to approach this
like eating a meal. Whether or not you feel you are learning anything,
trust the Holy Spirit to make it spiritual food and drink to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then once a week you meet to discuss the passage and ask Jesus to show
you what He is saying to you and what He wants you to do about it. You
may find it helpful for each of you to answer four simple questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this passage tell us about people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this passage tell us about Jesus or God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Jesus want to say to me personally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who does Jesus want me to share this message with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-to-read&#34;&gt;What to read&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have not-yet-Christians or new Christians in the group we
recommend you start your daily readings with the &lt;em&gt;Seven Signs of
Jesus&lt;/em&gt; (see later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-{=html}&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- --&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you have completed this we recommend you work through Luke&amp;rsquo;s
gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here there are a variety of options depending on the needs and
abilities of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could stay in the gospels, working through each in turn. I have
found this extremely profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could venture into Acts which is more like a fifth gospel than
any other part of scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-{=html}&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- --&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venturing further into the New Testament the shorter letters are
easier to understand than the longer ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament often refers to the Old Testament. At some point
you will probably want to follow the story of salvation through the
Old Testament. You can stick to the main stories and skip over the
rest or perhaps intersperse OT books with NT books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-much-to-read&#34;&gt;How much to read&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is to go at your own pace. The members must agree week by week
the minimum portion of scripture they will read the following week, but
then each member is free to concentrate on just one verse or to read
several chapters around the agreed passage. Each must follow what they
feel the Holy Spirit is leading them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a person has learnt to hear Jesus and obey Him from the Gospels,
you should consider reading much larger portions of scripture - up to
20-30 chapters a week. This ensures that scripture is read in its
context, in its entirety and repeatedly. So for example Romans (16
chapters) might be read once or perhaps twice in a week, but Ephesians
(6 chapters) might be read three to five times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;accountability-to-one-another&#34;&gt;Accountability to One another&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends who love another will speak up if they think their friend is
doing something wrong or is disregarding what Jesus is saying. But
friends who love each other will do this with love and gentleness,
seeking to win their friend, not to condemn them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should
restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.
Carry each other&amp;rsquo;s burdens, and in this way you will fulfil the law of
Christ.&amp;rdquo; (Gal 6:1-2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a friend feels that God is disciplining them, you will be careful and
prayerful in offering comfort, protecting your friend from the deceitful
and destructive lies of Satan but letting the Holy Spirit do his heart
surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God holds each of us accountable for how we live our lives and one day
we will have to give an account to Him. But if you recognise that you
are being tempted in an area of weakness and vulnerability you would be
very wise to share this with your Growth Group, or perhaps another
friend who really cares about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some groups are excessive or even obsessive about accountability, in the
misguided belief that confessing every known sin each week to one
another will help stop us sinning. I believe this practice is harmful
rather than helpful. It leads to self-righteousness and pride and
actually encourages people to hide their sin rather than share their
struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So take care:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let there be humility, love and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the heart rather than outward behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim to please Christ, not just have a clean track record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No pretence of holiness or wallowing in failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move towards genuine repentance, not just confession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find peace and acceptance not in our behaviour, but in His grace and
that Christ is our righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following questions are designed to help you think if there is
anything you wish to share for prayer and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;accountability-questions&#34;&gt;Accountability Questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you enjoying a consistent prayer life and listening to God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you sought first God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom this week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you struggled with any disappointments this week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you been self-conscious, self-pitying, or self-justifying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you given sufficient time to communicating with your spouse /
close friends? Is there harmony?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you been consistent in talking to, training and disciplining
your children / dependents / people you are discipling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you reconciled to everyone as far as it depends on you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any people or situations you are trying to avoid or
control? Have you been prideful, boastful or gossiped?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you handled your work and money in a godly, honest, faithful
and generous manor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you preoccupied with unhelpful thoughts or struggling with
addictive or compulsive behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you cared for your body in your diet, exercise, recreation and
sleep? Have you been excessive in TV or games?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has media or peer pressure influenced you wrongly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you demonstrated a servant&amp;rsquo;s heart? Not lording it over
another? Have you been angry or lacked mercy or compassion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you resting in Christ and not obsessing in your failures,
dwelling on disappointments or trusting in your own performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you like help with this week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prayer&#34;&gt;Prayer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having discussed your scripture reading and shared what you think Jesus
is saying to you, it is time to pray. Start with a time of thanksgiving
and then pray for one another and for any other issues that concern
members of the group and finally for those you are seeking to reach in
mission. Each member should try to name at least one not-yet-believer
they are specifically praying for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray with confident faith, fully expecting God to answer your prayers.
Remember Luke 12:32 &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;it is the Father&amp;rsquo;s good pleasure to give you the
Kingdom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mission&#34;&gt;Mission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to arrange to share in mission together each week. Jesus gave very
clear instructions for outreach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But whatever house you enter, first say, &amp;lsquo;Peace to this house.&amp;rsquo; And
if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on it; if not, it
will return to you. And remain in the same house, eating and drinking
such things as they give, for the labourer is worthy of his wages. Do
not go from house to house &amp;hellip; Heal the sick who are there and tell
them, &amp;lsquo;The kingdom of God is near you.&amp;rsquo; But when you enter a town and
are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, &amp;lsquo;Even the dust of your
town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of
this: The kingdom of God is near.&#39;&amp;rdquo; (Lk 10:5-11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could start by simply visiting and praying blessing and healing for
your immediate neighbours. If you can&amp;rsquo;t visit people in their houses,
look for a place where people know one another, such as a club or
popular café or local bar. Expect the Holy Spirit to lead you to good
soil, a &amp;ldquo;son of peace&amp;rdquo;, where He has been preparing the ground to
receive the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some important points arise from this scripture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go out to people&amp;rsquo;s houses and families with the gospel. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect
them to come to your church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring gospel peace and healing to a whole family, not just the
individual you meet first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the family to invite their friends to share in their discovery;
don&amp;rsquo;t you go house to house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person turns out to be poor soil we should encourage and
challenge them with the Gospel but if they do not chose to follow
Jesus faithfully, then don&amp;rsquo;t waste time on them. Look for better
soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find someone who wants to hear more about Jesus, offer to come
to their house each week and share with their whole family and any
friends or neighbours they would like to invite. Give them the &lt;em&gt;Seven
Signs of Jesus (signs 1-3)&lt;/em&gt; asking them to read the first sign every day
during the week. When you visit the following week let each person
answer the first question. Then let each person answer the second
question. Then the third and finally the fourth. Urge them to respond in
obedience to the third question, &amp;ldquo;What does this scripture say about
you?&amp;rdquo; and also to act on their answer to the last question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who needs to hear this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that from day one you are seeking to teach them to be obedient
to Jesus and to engage in mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience shows that anyone who completes the seven weeks will almost
certainly want to follow Jesus. At this point you will need to rearrange
your Growth Group because each new person who wishes to follow Jesus
will need to be in a Growth Group. Your group may need to disband so
each of you can lead a new group allowing you to add up to six new
people to the church!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;starting-a-growth-group---the-first-meeting&#34;&gt;Starting a Growth Group - The First Meeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Seven Signs of Jesus&lt;/em&gt; is a key tool for mission so each member
needs to be familiar with this study. If the members of a Growth Group
have not already done this study you should start with the &lt;em&gt;Seven Signs
of Jesus&lt;/em&gt; as your weekly scripture reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you each have a modern translation of the bible&lt;br&gt;
or a copy of the &lt;em&gt;Seven Signs of Jesus (signs 1-3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go through this leaflet and make sure each one understands the
purpose of the Growth Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take turns for each member to say how they feel they can show love
and care for one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, share in turn about each of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.  Finding a time when you can meet for 1½ hours each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.  Being open and honest with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c.  Being obedient to scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d.  Reaching out to your neighbours, friends and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray for one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agree on your next meeting time and the scripture you will read
during the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;multiplying-growth-groups&#34;&gt;Multiplying Growth Groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through mission a group will soon add another member to the group. The
group is allowed to meet for two weeks with four members so that the
newest members can see how the group works, and then the group should
multiply into two Growth Groups. Each group can then continue to add two
new members before multiplying again. Growth Groups of more than three
members are nowhere near as effective as groups of two or three and
should be strongly discouraged. Larger groups can function as Discovery
Groups, or several Growth Groups can meet together as a church (see
separate handbooks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demonstrating-the-gospel---seven-signs-of-jesus&#34;&gt;Demonstrating the Gospel - Seven Signs of Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades the church has used tracts with a summary of the &amp;ldquo;gospel&amp;rdquo;
for evangelism. These typically talk about the problem of our sin, the
solution in the cross and a &amp;ldquo;sinner&amp;rsquo;s prayer&amp;rdquo;. However, the Gospel is
never presented like this in the Holy-Spirit inspired scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we start reaching out to people held in the grip of Satan&amp;rsquo;s lies we
soon see the wisdom of Jesus&amp;rsquo; approach. He never &lt;em&gt;explained&lt;/em&gt; how He had
come to take the penalty for our sin; rather He &lt;em&gt;broke&lt;/em&gt; the power of
Satan. He demonstrated the Gospel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; rather than explaining its
&lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;. He set people free from sickness and demonic oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the Holy Spirit inspired John&amp;rsquo;s Gospel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples,
which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing
you may have life in his name.&amp;rdquo; (John 20:30-31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These verses describe precisely what we are trying to achieve with our
little tracts. The reality is that unsaved people are not interested in
the &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt; of salvation; they need to see and hear &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt; of
salvation. That is why a newly transformed believer telling his story
makes a good evangelist - we should listen and learn from them. The
signs which John records are a powerful way of sharing that good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John selected seven &lt;em&gt;miraculous&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;signs&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning water into wine (Jn 2:1-12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing the official&amp;rsquo;s son (Jn 4:46-54)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing the paralytic at the Pool of Bethesda (Jn 5:1-17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeding the 5000 (Jn 6:1-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on the water (Jn 6:15-25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing a man born blind (Jn 9:1-41)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Lazarus (Jn 11:1-46)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Seven Signs of Jesus&lt;/em&gt; are available as a series of leaflets. Please
ask your pastor for copies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Growth Groups - A Simple Guide</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/growth-groups/growth-groups-a-simple-guide/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/growth-groups/growth-groups-a-simple-guide/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;growth-groups---a-simple-guide&#34;&gt;Growth Groups - A Simple Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motto: &lt;strong&gt;Love one another &amp;ndash; Go and make disciples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Growth Group is two or three people who meet regularly (usually once
or twice a week) to be discipled by Jesus. Only one of the members needs
to be a Christian, the others may be anyone who is curious about Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-commands&#34;&gt;Two Commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Groups are the most effective way of obeying Jesus&#39; two great
commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Love one another&amp;rdquo; (John 13:34) and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name
of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to
observe all things that I have commanded you.&amp;quot; (Matthew 28:19-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-promises&#34;&gt;Two Promises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Groups depend on two promises Jesus made. This means that as we
read scripture together we can trust the Holy Spirit to lead us to
Jesus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.&amp;quot;
(Matthew 18:20) and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Spirit of truth will guide you into all the truth.&amp;quot; (John
16:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-warnings&#34;&gt;Two Warnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to church does not mean we are disciples. We can even do bible
study and still not be disciples. We must be obedient to Jesus and come
to know Jesus Himself, not just know the scriptures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not everyone who says to me, &amp;lsquo;Lord, Lord,&amp;rsquo; will enter the kingdom of
heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in
heaven.&amp;quot; (Matthew 7:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You study the Scriptures because you think that in them you have
eternal life ... yet you refuse to come to me to have life.&amp;rdquo; (John
5:39-40)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-relationships&#34;&gt;Two Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are called into two types of relationship. Firstly our relationship
with the Father; which is through knowing Jesus with the help of the
Holy Spirit. That is why we must learn to listen to Jesus and not just
study the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly we are called to love one another. So we must learn to listen
to one another in the Growth Group, and pray for one another, and love
one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;four-questions&#34;&gt;Four Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Growth Group meets, you start by reading aloud the passage you
have chosen. Each person should then repeat the passage in their own
words to make sure everyone understands what they have read. Then each
person should share in discussing these four questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this passage tell us about people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this passage tell us about Jesus or God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Jesus want to say to me personally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who does Jesus want me to share this message with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often need help to learn how to answer the first two questions.
They are NOT about what the passage is saying to us as Christians (that
is the third question). The first question is to help us think about the
people Jesus wants us to share the Good News with. What are they like?
What are their needs or fears? How are they deceived by Satan? Most
passages tell us something about what people are like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question is to help us think about God&#39;s nature; His love,
holiness, glory, mercy etc. Most passages tell us something about God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and fourth question should be personal; not &amp;quot;What does this
passage tell people they should do?&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;What specific thing in my
life right now is Jesus speaking to me about?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Which specific
friend or neighbour does Jesus want me to speak to about this passage?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then take turns to pray for each one in the group, and for your
outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;choosing-a-passage&#34;&gt;Choosing a Passage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Pastor may recommend some particular passages for you to read to
help you get started with your Growth Group. You should start with short
passages or even single verses. Once you are used to studying the
scriptures in your Growth Group we recommend you work your way through
Luke&#39;s Gospel and then the other Gospels before moving on to the rest
of the bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go at the pace that suits your group. Do not wear people out with
difficult passages or long meetings. You do not need to understand
everything, just leave out passages you find difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;starting-new-groups&#34;&gt;Starting New Groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family groups are a great way to start. You might start meeting as a
whole family, but should soon divide into threes (plus any small
children). You can invite someone else to see how your group works, or
offer to help them start their own group, and meet with them for a few
weeks to get them started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;his-presence-1&#34;&gt;His Presence &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church is not just the gathering of God&amp;rsquo;s people; it is the presence of
Jesus among His people. Without His presence there is no church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in
the midst of them.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 18:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But His presence is not with us simply to observe or comfort or to hear
our prayers, but to lead us in His mission. The promise of His presence
came with a commission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore
and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe
all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even
to the end of the age.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 28:18-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church is ministry BY Jesus, not ministry FOR Jesus and should be
measured not by our attendance but His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By faith we know His presence, and by acting on that faith we see the
results of His presence. This should be at the heart of what it means
for us to be and do church. God dwelling with His people; Christ acting
through His Body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-commission&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Commission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-what-i-have-commanded-you&#34;&gt;Do what I have commanded you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Great Commission must be among the scriptures best known by
Christians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore
and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe
all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even
to the end of the age.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 28:18-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a very important thing to notice about this commission. Jesus
did not say &amp;ldquo;teach them all I taught you&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;teach them all about me&amp;rdquo;
or &amp;ldquo;teach them the bible.&amp;rdquo; He said &amp;ldquo;teach them to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; me.&amp;rdquo; This
puts a rather different emphasis on things. Certainly we want to learn
about God and for people to think deeply and intelligently about God. We
therefore value teaching about God. But the emphasis of Jesus commission
is not teaching knowledge, but teaching obedience to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching obedience to Jesus is not the same as teaching the stories and
parables of Jesus. It is not the same as teaching the doctrines of
salvation and grace and resurrection. It is not the same as preaching
the gospel and leading people to Christ. All these things are good, but
they are not the great commission. There is only one way to fulfil the
great commission and that is to teach people to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People need to be taught how to obey Jesus. It does not come naturally.
They need to be taught how to read the bible, especially the gospels,
how to listen to Jesus speaking to them through the Holy Spirit, how to
believe and trust Him and how to do what He says to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipleship is like car mechanics; a group of apprentices pouring over
the manual, discussing what it means and how to do it, then going out
and having a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;starting-small&#34;&gt;Starting small&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am
there in the midst of them&amp;rdquo; (Matt 18:20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic unit of church is twos and threes encouraging one another in
obedience to Jesus. That is a good place to start. If we cannot discover
the presence and will of Jesus in groups of two or three, then we cannot
expect to do so with a larger group. If we can&amp;rsquo;t multiply groups of 2 or
3 we will never multiply the church.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipleship is an adventure of faith. It requires people to be open and
real with one another and to be prepared to take risks and make
mistakes. Disciple making is a time consuming business requiring deep
relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-no-bible-teacher&#34;&gt;What? No bible teacher?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must not think that every small group needs a skilled and trained
leader. Three brand new believers can read the scriptures together,
learn from the Holy Spirit and see God answer their prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must not hold people back because they have not been trained. We must
not teach people to be dependent on us to understand the word. They must
know they can feed themselves. They must know that Jesus Himself has
commissioned them and sends them with His authority to do His work. They
must know they can depend upon the Holy Spirit and the scriptures to be
their teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our job as teachers is not to give messages &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the word, but to
demonstrate our conviction that Jesus Himself has the words of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged
sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and
marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.&amp;rdquo; (Heb 4:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you do that? Do we think we can improve on it? Trust the Holy Spirit
to apply His word to a person&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;front-line-action-from-the-start&#34;&gt;Front-line Action from the Start&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus chose uneducated fishermen to be His disciples and sent them out
on mission immediately. They were not trained in bible study and
leadership. They didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to preach or lead prayer meetings.
Nevertheless, Jesus sent them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Jesus said to them again, &amp;ldquo;Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I
also send you.&amp;rdquo; (John 20:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be
wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 10:16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New believers must learn to trust God right away so, like Jesus, we send
new believers on mission immediately.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But they must know that it is
not us who are sending them but Jesus, and they go with His authority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore
and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe
all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even
to the end of the age.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 28:18-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission we are sent on is also clear; to do what Jesus did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and
authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. He sent them to preach
the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. (Lk 9:1-2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such must be our expectation from the very start of a believer&amp;rsquo;s new
life in Christ. We must teach faith-filled obedience from day 1. &amp;ldquo;See
one, do one, teach one.&amp;rdquo; A new believer only needs to observe ministry
once before he/she should be having a go themselves. Having ministered
once, they can begin to pass on what they have learnt immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-in-his-name&#34;&gt;Going in His Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of discipleship, and therefore fulfilling the great
commission, is incredibly simple; groups of two or three believers
experiencing the presence of Jesus and ministering Gospel truth and
healing in His authority to unbelievers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how and where are you going to start your group of two or three?
Jesus gives us clear and simple instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and
stay there till you go out.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 10:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by going to a place and asking people &amp;ldquo;who needs to hear the
gospel?&amp;rdquo; We are likely to be directed to poor desperate souls whose
lives are in tatters. Then we do what Jesus said to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As you go, preach, saying, &amp;lsquo;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&amp;rsquo; Heal the
sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you
have received, freely give.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 10:7-8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We minister healing and deliverance to those in need, and we start a
Bible Discovery Group in the new believers home, not ours (Matt 10:11
above). That will ensure the gospel reaches the whole family, not just
an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, again following Jesus&#39; example, we baptize new believers
immediately and publicly and let them baptise their converts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
made and baptized more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself did not
baptize, but His disciples), He left Judea and departed again to
Galilee. (Jn 4:1-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we start? We start &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the harvest and start small with 2 or
3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-seed-and-the-soils&#34;&gt;The Seed and the Soils&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus gave instruction about our mission both directly and through
parables. The parable of the soils is very instructive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow. And it happened, as he sowed,
that some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds of the air came and
devoured it. Some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much
earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.
But when the sun was up it was scorched, and because it had no root it
withered away. And some seed fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up
and choked it, and it yielded no crop. But other seed fell on good
ground and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced: some
thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.&amp;rdquo; And He said to them, &amp;ldquo;He
who has ears to hear, let him hear!&amp;rdquo; But when He was alone, those around
Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable. And He said to them,
&amp;ldquo;To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but
to those who are outside, all things come in parables, so that &amp;lsquo;Seeing
they may see and not perceive, And hearing they may hear and not
understand; Lest they should turn, And their sins be forgiven them.&#39;&amp;rdquo;
And He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Do you not understand this parable? How then will
you understand all the parables? The sower sows the word&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (Mr 4:3-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some important lessons here are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need good seed &amp;ndash; the Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need good soil to grow a church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot be sure which soil is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three quarters of the seed will prove fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two thirds of the growth will prove fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have ears to hear and accept these basic truths about sowing the
word, we will save a great deal of heart-ache over trying to make
fruitless situations bear fruit. Concentrate on the fruit-bearing soil
and don&amp;rsquo;t waste time on the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into
its streets and say, &amp;lsquo;The very dust of your city which clings to us we
wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God
has come near you.&amp;rsquo; But I say to you that it will be more tolerable in
that Day for Sodom than for that city.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 10:10-12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of
Me.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 10:38)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the fruitful people be a provocation to the fruitless ones. Jesus
did not lack compassion for fruitless people, but He still sent them
away. According to Jesus&amp;rsquo; interpretation of this parable, fruitless
people are fruitless because they have not given up on the world&amp;rsquo;s
fruits. They want the world plus a bit of Jesus. Jesus said you cannot
serve two masters and He told people so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finding-good-soil&#34;&gt;Finding Good Soil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we cannot be sure we have found good soil until we see its
fruit, Jesus did tell us where to look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bad people: &amp;ldquo;I have not come to call &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; righteous, but sinners,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to repentance.&amp;rdquo; (Lu 5:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;poor people: &amp;ldquo;God has chosen the poor of this world &lt;em&gt;to be&lt;/em&gt; rich in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love
Him?&amp;rdquo; (Jas 2:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;child-like people: &amp;ldquo;unless you are converted and become as little&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.&amp;rdquo; (Matt
18:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-{=html}&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- --&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;desperate people: &amp;ldquo;Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you
will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 7:7 NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;despised people: &amp;ldquo;God has chosen the foolish things of the world to
put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the
world to put to shame the things which are mighty; and the base
things of the world and the things which are despised God has
chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things
that are, that no flesh should glory in His presence.&amp;rdquo; (1Co 1:27-29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police know where the good soil is; ask them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;avoiding-the-bad-soil&#34;&gt;Avoiding the bad soil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-made people: &amp;ldquo;not many wise according to the flesh, not many
mighty, not many noble, are called.&amp;rdquo; (1Co 1:26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-righteous people: &amp;ldquo;Those who are well have no need of a
physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the
righteous, but sinners, to repentance.&amp;rdquo; (Lu 5:31-32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealthy people: &amp;ldquo;How hard it is for those who have riches to enter
the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo;
(Lu 18:24-25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not exactly encourage half-hearted disciples, He sent them
away! Jesus loved people by confronting them with their choices. He sent
the rich young ruler, whom He loved, away. To do otherwise is cruel,
selfish and counterproductive! &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him,
and asked Him, &amp;ldquo;Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal
life?&amp;rdquo; So Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Why do you call Me good? No one is good
but One, that is, God. &amp;ldquo;You know the commandments: &amp;lsquo;Do not commit
adultery,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Do not murder,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Do not steal,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Do not bear false witness,&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;Do not defraud,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Honour your father and your mother.&#39;&amp;rdquo; And he answered
and said to Him, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth.&amp;rdquo;
Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, &amp;ldquo;One thing you
lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you
will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow
Me.&amp;rdquo; But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had
great possessions. (Mk 10:17-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gods-prepared-soil&#34;&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s prepared soil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this general guidance about where to look for good soil,
we can expect the Holy Spirit to lead us to good soil where He has been
preparing the ground to receive the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face
of the earth, and has determined their pre-appointed times and the
boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the
hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far
from each one of us;&amp;rdquo; (Ac 17:26-27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But whatever house you enter, first say, &amp;lsquo;Peace to this house.&amp;rsquo; And if
a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on it; if not, it will
return to you. And remain in the same house, eating and drinking such
things as they give, for the labourer is worthy of his wages. Do not go
from house to house.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 10:5-7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some important points arise from these scriptures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has set the times and places for people to live so they might
seek and find God: expect your family, neighbours, work colleagues
and other acquaintances to have been placed in your circle by God so
they might find Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go into people&amp;rsquo;s houses and families with the gospel. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect
them to come to your church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring gospel peace and healing to a whole family, not just
individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a family receives you, build a close friendship with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you go house to house; let the family do that, inviting their
friends to share in their discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t visit people in their houses, look for a place where people
know one another, such as a club or popular café or local bar.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-seed-to-harvest&#34;&gt;From Seed to Harvest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share the gospel (sow the seed), God transforms a person&amp;rsquo;s life
(brings growth), that person becomes an obedient disciple (bears fruit)
and they minister Christ to others (we reap a harvest). Our place in
this process is to be a friend and an example, teaching a new believer
how to depend on Christ and His word through the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kingdom grows by multiplying healthy disciples.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If a person
turns out to be poor soil we should encourage and challenge them with
the Gospel and make them chose whom they will follow. If they do not
rise to the challenge and follow Jesus faithfully, then don&amp;rsquo;t waste time
on them. Look for better soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-can-you-keep-things-on-track&#34;&gt;How can you keep things on track?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must trust Jesus to be the head of His church and the Holy Spirit to
lead and teach His children. To impose control over small groups and
churches in order to ensure they conform to some pattern we have decided
upon is to go beyond our remit as disciple makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was perfectly clear and un-phased that 3 out of 4 seeds may
ultimately prove fruitless; that tares will grow up with the wheat; that
false prophets will do mighty wonders without ever knowing Jesus; that
talents will be given which are buried and that many will fall away. In
the light of this we must trust Jesus with His church. Our attempts to
protect what we have by hedging it about with rules only have the effect
of stifling growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should teach well, warn people who depart from the simplicity of the
Gospel or who get ensnared by worldliness and pray for God&amp;rsquo;s
intervention. But in the end we must let go. In our care for the church
we should not end up babysitting poor soils, but give ourselves to
working with the good soil.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-pattern-for-multiplication&#34;&gt;A Pattern for Multiplication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; commission for discipleship implies multiplying disciples which
leads to multiplying leaders and multiplying churches. Paul was obedient
to this, moving quickly from one place to another leaving a trail of
young churches behind him. Part of Paul&amp;rsquo;s strategy was to maintain a
simple pattern which he taught wherever he went:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of
those who live according to the pattern we gave you. (Phil 3:17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul does not give us his pattern in a simple form, but it can be
discerned from his letters, and is perhaps summarised by his repeated
themes of faith, hope and love:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these
is love.&amp;rdquo; (1Co 13:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labour of love, and
patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and
Father,&amp;rdquo; (1Th 1:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of
faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation.&amp;rdquo; (1Th 5:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works of faith &amp;ndash; healing the sick and delivering people from the snares
of the devil; labours of love &amp;ndash; loving one another as Jesus loves us;
patience of hope &amp;ndash; living life out of our secure position in Christ.
These are then DNA of our discipleship and should be in every aspect of
our private and corporate church life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every disciple, every meeting, every ministry must have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the DNA at
the same time&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; works of faith, labours of love and patient hope in
the sight of our God and Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other keys are seen here: firstly the leaders MUST set the example.
If you are promoting Growth Groups for your people, it is essential that
the leaders, including the pastor, are also in Growth Groups. Only those
who experience the power of a Growth Group for themselves will be truly
passionate about them. Secondly, you will discover new leaders as you
&amp;ldquo;take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you&amp;rdquo;.
Effective leaders will emerge from multiplying Growth Groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evangelism&#34;&gt;Evangelism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The missional life is: Make friends, Throw parties, Tell stories and
Give gifts. Sounds both entirely possible and fun&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disciples should look for good soil in which to sow the seed of the
word. But what should we sow? How should we present the gospel? For
decades the church has used tracts with a summary of the &amp;ldquo;gospel&amp;rdquo; for
evangelism. These typically talk about the problem of our sin, the
solution in the cross and a &amp;ldquo;sinners prayer&amp;rdquo;. Do you not think it
strange that this &amp;ldquo;gospel&amp;rdquo; is not presented in this form anywhere in
scripture. It is even stranger that this &amp;ldquo;gospel&amp;rdquo; cannot be easily
derived from the four Gospels. We do well to heed the Gospel which the
Holy Spirit has already designed for us: John said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples,
which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing
you may have life in his name. (Jn 20:30-31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those verses describe precisely what we are trying to achieve with our
little tracts. It is time we followed the inspired scriptures rather
than trying to improve on them with our selected verses. The reality is
that unsaved people are not interested in the &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; of our salvation
which our tracts try to explain. They need to hear genuine good news.
The signs which John records are a powerful way of sharing that good
news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John selected seven &lt;em&gt;miraculous&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;signs&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water into Wine (Jn 2:1-12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing of official&amp;rsquo;s son (Jn 4:46-54)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing of paralytic at Pool of Bethesda (Jn 5:1-17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeding of 5000 (Jn 6:1-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on the water (Jn 6:15-25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing of man born blind (Jn 9:1-41)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising of Lazarus (Jn 11:1-46)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A method which has been found very powerful is to get a seeker to take
one story a week and read it every day. Each week meet them and ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[]{#_Toc439784027 .anchor}What does this passage tell us about
people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this passage tell us about Jesus or God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Jesus want to say to me personally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who does Jesus want me to share this message with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;growth-groups&#34;&gt;Growth Groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building block of the church is 2-3 disciples in intimate
relationship. Across the world very small Growth Groups, Discipleship
Groups, Life Transformation Groups &amp;ndash; call them what you like &amp;ndash; have
proved to be the essential foundation of multiplying churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 4 or more, it is very easy for a person to drift into the
background, or for sub-groups to form. Groups of 2-3 are the ideal size
for both accountability and mission:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by
two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.&amp;rdquo; (Lk
10:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,
&amp;ldquo;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called
them.&amp;rdquo; So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on
them and sent them off. (Acts 13:2-3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;em&gt;Growth Group Handbook&lt;/em&gt; for details of starting and running
Growth Groups.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Church Buildings Cripple the Gospel</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/how-church-buildings-cripple-the-gospel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-church-buildings-cripple-the-gospel&#34;&gt;How Church Buildings Cripple the Gospel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-story&#34;&gt;A story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day a group of people turned up in town. Some we knew, but most were
strangers &amp;ndash; and there were some white people with them. They told us
about Jesus and healed some who were sick. They travelled from house to
house and then from village to village baptizing those who wanted to
follow Jesus. We needed to learn more about this Jesus so they urged us
to come to some meetings in town. To start with we met in a borrowed
Lutheran church building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These missionaries kept visiting us and soon they obtained land in the
town and started to build a large sturdy meeting place of their own. It
went up surprisingly quickly and they paid for all the materials and
provided food for those who helped to build it. We assume that the white
men were paying for this. Now we have somewhere dry and sheltered that
we can all meet to pray and sing and hear teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have a problem. We have been telling our neighbours in the
villages beyond us about Jesus and want to start more churches. But we
do not have the money to build church buildings, and we do not have the
white men to help us. And now we want to start churches even further
afield. But the people are even poorer than we are! We have asked the
missionaries to build churches for us. They have been as generous as
they can and given us some money from time to time, but it is not enough
to build anything. We do not know what to do, so we are looking around
to see if there are any other churches in the region that can help us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This storey is imagined, but might easily be told by someone from a
village near Ganglata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-different-story&#34;&gt;A different story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was launching a region-wide campaign; there were no end of places
that He wanted His disciples to reach out to. Any political campaigner
would load up his emissaries with posters and tea-shirts and money - the
best-resourced candidates make the biggest impact. But Jesus turns this
on its head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you go, proclaim this message: &amp;lsquo;The kingdom of heaven has come
near.&amp;rsquo; Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy
and drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not
get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts&amp;mdash; no
bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff&lt;/strong&gt;, for the
worker is worth his keep. Whatever town or village you enter, search
there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave
(Matt 10:7-11). Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give
you, for the worker deserves his wages (Luke 10:7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus&#39; campaign He says to &amp;ldquo;give freely&amp;rdquo; and yet &amp;ldquo;take nothing with
you&amp;rdquo;. This apparent paradox is really important: &amp;ldquo;Take nothing and give
freely&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unlimited-resources&#34;&gt;Unlimited Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s compare these two stories. What does the &amp;ldquo;man-of-peace&amp;rdquo;
experience in Jesus&#39; day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two simply dressed people walked into my village carrying nothing
with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked if they could stay a few days in my house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-{=html}&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- --&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They brought healing, deliverance, baptism and transformed lives to
our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They left to take their message to another village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have gone and done the same&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does our imagined friend in Ganglata experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-resourced missionary team, complete with their own cars,
bringing their own food and even their own cooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They bring the gospel message with healing, deliverance, baptism and
transformed lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large well-funded church building goes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not have the resources to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you see the problem? It is only natural that the events connected
with hearing the Gospel remain associated in people&amp;rsquo;s minds. And those
associations affect how they go about passing the Gospel on. If the
Gospel gets associated with material resources it gets crippled. If it
gets associated with white-men or with church-buildings, or with pastors
or with denominations or with organisations &amp;ndash; all these associations
cripple the Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipients of the Gospel must not associate human resources with the
Gospel. Disciples are rich beyond measure with an endless supply of
gifts to give away, but our supply is not dependent on human resources
&amp;ndash; not our own nor anyone else&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To emphasis this point Jesus specifically instructs the disciples to
depend upon those they minister to; to stay in their houses and eat
their food. In human terms we are supposed to be dependent upon the
willing generosity of those we minister to! Jesus is clear; in both
Gospel accounts He reiterates this by saying &amp;ldquo;A labourer is worthy of
his wages&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; meaning that those who receive the Gospel should provide
for those who bring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-does-our-help-come-from&#34;&gt;Where does our help come from&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instruction &amp;ldquo;Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with
you in your belts&amp;mdash; no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or
a staff&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; was so important to Jesus because it goes to the heart of
our trust in God. Do you remember the Psalmists cry &amp;ldquo;I lift up my eyes
to the mountains - where does my help come from? My help comes from the
Lord&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (Ps 121). Jesus is teaching them to rely on God for the
resources to go on mission. We know this because Jesus refers back to
this instruction much later in His ministry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus asked them, &amp;ldquo;When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals,
did you lack anything?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nothing,&amp;rdquo; they answered (Luke 22:35).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the issue Jesus is trying to impress upon His disciples when it
comes to taking the Gospel to new places: &amp;ldquo;Was there anything you wish
you had brought with you? Did you find yourselves saying &amp;lsquo;If only we had
such-and-such our mission would have been so much more effective&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; did
you lack anything? Were you hindered in your mission because you went
empty-handed?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus wanted His disciples to learn from their experience so that they
would know that the Gospel is good-news on its own. It should not be
encumbered with gifts; and mission should not be encumbered with
resource-heavy mission strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zero-cost-church-planting&#34;&gt;Zero-cost church-planting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel is too precious and too easily corrupted for us to risk
ignoring Jesus&#39; specific instructions. It is clearly not actual sticks
and sandals and money bags that Jesus is concerned with, but what they
represent. The propagation of the Gospel must not be associated with
wealth. Zero-cost church-planting was Jesus&#39; idea, and Jesus&#39; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model for evangelism and church-planting is totally biblical. It is
Jesus&#39; model and that followed by the apostles in the New Testament.
They did not go with gifts for the poor and money to put up
meeting-places. On the contrary, they stayed in other people&amp;rsquo;s homes,
met in borrowed buildings and collected money to give to other
communities that were facing famine. This is the biblical model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, as with so many aspects of the Gospel, subsequent generations of
Christians have departed from Jesus&#39; model and done things their own
way. It is &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; to want to avoid being a burden to any community we
visit with the Gospel. It is &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; to want to take gifts of money,
food and clothing to give away. It is &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; to want our own meeting
place so that we can gather people for worship and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; aspects have their proper time and place &amp;ndash; but when
we get them out of place, they can be harmful to the Gospel. It is vital
that we listen to and learn from Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cart-before-the-horse&#34;&gt;The Cart before the Horse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t stay in a guest-house, stay in a villagers house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t spread the burden of your visit by staying each night in a
different home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t pay for your own food &amp;ndash; eat what is offered to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t take gifts to give away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul was obedient to this when he travelled to a new place. Then, if he
ended up staying for a significant period he rented a house and paid his
own way so as not to burden the infant-church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul&amp;rsquo;s churches met in synagogues, temple courts, market-places &amp;ndash;
wherever they could find room. They also met in people&amp;rsquo;s homes and
courtyards. Putting a building up for a new church to meet in is not
something we ever read of in the New Testament. It is putting the cart
before the horse. A building &lt;strong&gt;must not&lt;/strong&gt; be seen as &lt;em&gt;facilitating&lt;/em&gt; a
church. If people start to think they need a building in order to have a
church then you cripple the Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mission into a new area puts up their own building too soon they
risk damaging the Gospel. Here are just some of the issues that can
arise in people&amp;rsquo;s minds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to be able to gather people together to tell them how to
follow Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot start a new church in a neighbouring village because we do
not have a building and cannot afford to build one..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church buildings are a higher priority on limited resources than
feeding the poor or children&amp;rsquo;s health or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to appear successful if people are going to take my message
seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches start with people, not buildings. Churches grow with people,
not buildings. Churches fulfil the Great Commission with people, not
buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of tradition, people assume that a church needs its own
building. But this way of thinking needs to be corrected. Israel wanted
a king so that they would be like all the other nations &amp;ndash; but that was
against God&amp;rsquo;s will and command for the nation. Being like everyone else
is not what the Church is called to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-meeting-place&#34;&gt;A Meeting Place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches have become associated with church buildings and this
association has brought many problems. The message of evangelism has
become &amp;quot;Go to church...&amp;quot; instead of bringing healing and deliverance
into people&#39;s homes. Discipleship has become &amp;quot;Go to church&amp;quot; instead
of listening to and obeying Jesus in our homes. Church-planting has
become a matter of erecting buildings instead of planting groups of
disciples. Church buildings are used to provide churches with a sense of
identity and prestige &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;No one will take your church seriously if you
don&#39;t have your own building...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said we should be a light set on a hill, not hidden away. When
looking for a place to gather believers for worship, fellowship, shared
meals and teaching, we look first for public buildings where believers
are easily seen by the community and where non-members can easily come
and see what is happening. The first choice would be a palaver hut or
market area or some other open and public place. Perhaps a clinic or
school may be usable, or a house with a large porch. If no such place is
available we recommend approaching the community leaders and proposing
that the community erect a suitable meeting place which the church can
share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A church based on Growth Groups can grow and multiply and church plant
without ever having its own building. Buildings must be seen as a luxury
for communities that can well afford them rather than as a necessity for
mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;food-for-thought&#34;&gt;Food for thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tower of Babel is instructive concerning the use of a building to
provide a sense of belonging for churches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the whole world had one language and a common speech ... Then
they said, &amp;ldquo;Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that
reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves;
otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.&amp;rdquo;
(Genesis 11:1,4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people were united with a common language and culture, but became
concerned that they might become scattered. This is very similar to the
situation of a small community of believers in a town, or across a few
neighbouring villages. They are united in Jesus; they &amp;quot;have one
language&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; the Gospel. But they may desire a more tangible mark of
identity to try to keep them together. This is a natural human desire -
it is what creates communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the story of Babel tells us that this desire to build a city (or a
church meeting place) may come from a fear that without the building
people will drift away; they will become scattered. The building
provides a sense of belonging, identity and significance (&amp;quot;to make a
name for ourselves&amp;quot;). But God was not pleased with this plan and He put
a stop to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were
building. The Lord said, &amp;ldquo;If as one people speaking the same language
they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be
impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language
so they will not understand each other.&amp;rdquo; So the Lord scattered them
from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.
(Genesis 11:5-8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells us that when people get together and agree on some project
they can make it happen &amp;ndash; even if it is not God&#39;s will! These people
should not have been trying to make a name for themselves, but rather
they should have been worshipping God and depending on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start erecting a church building we need to be sure that this
is God&#39;s will, and not just our own response to the fear that without a
building people will not take us seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I came to believe in Healing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/how-i-came-to-believe-in-healing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/how-i-came-to-believe-in-healing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-kingdom-of-god&#34;&gt;The Kingdom of God&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&#39; teaching about the Kingdom has had a profound effect on my life
in recent years. Not just on my understanding, but on my faith and my
practice and my experience of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago I had great difficulty knowing what to do with the many
outrageous promises of Jesus about answered prayer and healing. I was a
Christian agnostic. I firmly believed all that a good evangelical
charismatic Christian believes, but in practice didn&amp;rsquo;t know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to
believe much of what Jesus said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &amp;ldquo;As the Father sent me so I send you.&amp;rdquo;  This is innocuous
enough if you think Jesus came to be nice to people and teach them good
morals, but that is not what my bible says. My bible says &amp;ldquo;Jesus went
about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil.&amp;rdquo; I
read that Jesus sent out 72 with power to heal and authority over
demons. I read that Jesus healed all who came to him who were sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think that Jesus did all that healing to prove he was the
Messiah, but four years ago as I was reading the Gospels again I
realised that healing and deliverance was not about who &lt;em&gt;Jesus&lt;/em&gt; is but
about what the &lt;em&gt;kingdom&lt;/em&gt; is. It was the core and essence of Jesus&#39;
Gospel. &amp;ldquo;If I cast out demons by the finger of God then the kingdom of
God has come amongst you.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was persuaded by my reading of the Gospels that healing and
deliverance is meant to be the foundation of our proclamation and
demonstration of the Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment God did something in my heart. I became a believer.
Instead of struggling with so many of the promises I decided I had
better believe them. I had a wonderful joyous release of faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Paul wrote to the Romans happened to me. &amp;ldquo;May the God of hope fill
you with all joy and peace in believing.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that happened was that I was filled with the absolute
and joyous conviction that I would wake up the next morning with my life
long tinnitus gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I woke, guess what! I still had my tinnitus. What was I to do with
my so-called newly found faith? What are we to do with these outrageous
promises - especially when we give it a go and fail? Well I went round
to an elderly friend who I had just heard had a very painful and
inoperable problem with the vertebrae in her neck. I laid hands on her
and prayed and she was instantly healed and remains free of this
condition today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That experience has helped me to keep trying regardless of previous
failures. Jesus told many parables to encourage us to keep taking risks
of faith. A king went on a long journey and before He left have his
property to three of his trusted servants. On his eventual return two
had gone out and taken risks with that property and made a profit, but
one was fearful of failure and did nothing with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus made it very clear that he is not pleased if we shrink back in
fear of failure rather than step out in faith on his promises. On the
other hand he gave us many encouragements to persevere in faith.  &amp;ldquo;Ask
and you will receive&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;Whatever you ask in faith, believing you have
received it, will be done for you. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these last four years I have set aside discouragement and believed
for healing and deliverance.  I have seen hundreds of instant healings
and hundreds of healings coming in the days following prayer. Around 70%
of those who have asked for healing have been healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen healing of everything from aches and pains and colds to
broken bones, blindness, deafness, dumbness, the lame, epilepsy,
depression, nervous breakdown, cancer, heart disease, post viral
weakness, genetic diseases, decades of arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this and I&amp;rsquo;m just an ordinary member of a dozy village Anglican
church. My day job is teaching people how to program computers. There
was no one in the church encouraging me. I&amp;rsquo;ve not been to a healing and
miracles conference nor had someone lay hands on me. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been
slain in the spirit or visited the third heaven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have a gift of healing; I&amp;rsquo;m just trying to believe the
Gospels and giving it a go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I am not anything unusual. You only have to look on YouTube to find
dozens of videos of ordinary believers taking healing onto the streets
of their communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is on the move to bear witness to his kingdom wherever people have
the courage to believe what Jesus said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking &amp;ldquo;those promises are for me too, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take
risks and believe God.&amp;rdquo; well that&amp;rsquo;s wonderful. But I warn you that every
&lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; of faith involves a &lt;em&gt;fight&lt;/em&gt; of faith. I had a friend who had
received multiple miraculous healings and then died of cancer. Every
disappointment requires you to get up again, reassert your faith, refuse
to give up and then look for an opportunity to have another go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you have previously been bold in faith and given up in despair.
I have been there countless times. I have a deep and lifelong
relationship with crushing disappointment. It is the cancer of our faith
that we just have to keep fighting.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I have survived
but it is certainly by God&amp;rsquo;s grace and with his help, and I think also
my constant reading of the Gospels. Every day for the last four years I
have read a chapter of the Gospels. I am fully persuaded that it is the
father&amp;rsquo;s good pleasure to give me the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although healing and deliverance had featured quite significantly in my
ministry these last few years, that is not really my focus. It is the
kingdom that excites me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since Jesus&#39; proclamation of the kingdom was founded upon healing
and deliverance, so, I believe, must mine be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mk 1:14-15 Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the good news of God.
&amp;ldquo;The time has come; the kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe
the good news.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to announce that the long promised kingdom was now here and
he is the king. That was the good news. It is the Gospel that I too am
commissioned to proclaim.  Jesus said all authority has been given to
him and he is with us to go and do what he did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I proclaim Jesus is king if I can&amp;rsquo;t demonstrate it in healing
and deliverance?  Without that all I have is &amp;ldquo;Jesus is king in heaven,
but the devil rules on earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we are told, Jesus came to destroy the works of the evil one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is king and his kingdom is at hand.  It is within us and flows out
from us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is not just king in name but in reality. He is not just king on
judgement day but now. The ascension was not the end of his rule on
earth but the beginning of his rule over all the earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore the kinship of Jesus needs to be demonstrated not only in
church but out there in the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can go door knocking or treasure hunting or healing on the streets.
We can offer healing to our unbelieving friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The time has come, the kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe
the good news.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time for us to repent and believe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Pray</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/how-to-pray/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/how-to-pray/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-pray&#34;&gt;How to Pray&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-like-the-pagans&#34;&gt;Not Like the Pagans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer is so natural that virtually everyone prays &amp;ndash; even atheists! But
Jesus very clearly tells us NOT to pray like unbelievers pray:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think
they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them,
for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.&amp;quot; Matthew
6:7-8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So do not worry, saying, &amp;lsquo;What shall we eat?&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;What shall we
drink?&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;What shall we wear?&amp;rsquo; For the pagans run after all these
things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek
first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be
given to you as well.&amp;quot; Matthew 6:31-33&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says that bringing our basic needs to God in prayer is not a sign
of faith, but of unbelief! It means we do not trust that God cares for
us out of His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says that worrying and praying about our basic needs is what
pagans do, and we should not behave like them. Jesus tells us that we
should simply trust our heavenly Father to provide for our needs
according to His love and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of long or frequent prayers about our personal or family needs,
we should trust God for those and instead be praying for His Kingdom to
come to our family, our community, our nation and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pray-like-jesus-prayed&#34;&gt;Pray like Jesus prayed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, He made this very simple
prayer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, &amp;ldquo;Father, I thank You that You have
heard Me. And I know that You always hear Me.&amp;rdquo; John 11:41-42&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how we should pray: with the complete confidence that our Father
has heard our prayer, and always hears our prayers. Later in this study
we will see the promises for God to answer our prayers. Let&#39;s stop
praying like pagans, and start praying like Jesus...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prayer-is-how-god-works&#34;&gt;Prayer is How God Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand about prayer is that it is &lt;strong&gt;not about
humans getting God to do things&lt;/strong&gt;. Prayer is the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;internal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
communication &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;within&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the trinity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&amp;quot;**You are My Son, today I have begotten You. Ask of Me, and I will
give You The nations for Your inheritance.&amp;quot; Psalm 2:7-8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, &amp;ldquo;Father, I thank You that You
have heard Me. And I know that You always hear Me.&amp;rdquo; John 11:41-42&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I pray for those you have given me, for they are yours.&amp;quot; John 17:9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to
God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.
Hebrews 7:25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus tells us what the Father has commanded Him to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of
all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.&amp;quot; (John
6:39)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so He prays to the Father:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you
protect them from the evil one.&amp;quot; (John 17:15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This heavenly intercession is a mystery, but one we must whole-heartedly
embrace. Asking and giving and receiving through prayer is how the
Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit relate to one another in love and
complete unity. So what can we say about prayer within the Godhead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reluctance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need for persuasion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need for one to inform the other about needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is complete agreement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking and giving and receiving through prayer is always a delight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though God always knows all things He still functions through
prayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer is God&#39;s &amp;quot;Language of Love&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prayer-is-sharing-in-gods-language-of-love&#34;&gt;Prayer is Sharing in God&#39;s Language of Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couples who love one another usually develop a secret language of love -
small actions or special phrases that each understand to be a special
message of love. That is what prayer is like within the Godhead. It is
how they share love between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an incredible thing that God invites us to share in their language
of love; in prayer. Prayer is not long-distance communication. It is not
like texting or emailing God, it is intimate communion. However remote
God might feel to us when we pray, that is how how God sees it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For through Jesus we have access by one Spirit to the Father.&amp;rdquo; Eph
2:18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full
assurance that faith brings.&amp;quot; Hebrews 10:22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer is an adventure exploring the very heart of God and sharing in
His passions and purposes for the world. To truly pray is to be caught
up with the Holy Spirit into God&#39;s throne room; not to plead with God
but to rule with him. Prayer and especially intercession is sharing in
the divine nature and as such is an expression and experience of deep
intimacy with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer therefore starts with listening, &amp;quot;Lord, please show me what is
on your heart for this situation. Can I join in the heavenly
intercession for this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This holy privilege of access to the throne, before whom angels bow,
shielding their eyes from the intensity of the glory, is not to be taken
lightly or abused by hasty or covetous requests. In that place we pray
with Jesus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... nevertheless, not my will, but Your will be done ... May Your
Kingdom come on earth.&amp;quot; (Matthew 26:39, 6:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-is-as-we-rest-in-christ-that-we-are-included-in-this-intimate-relationship-of-prayer&#34;&gt;It is as we rest in Christ that we are included in this intimate relationship of prayer:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and
I in you&amp;rdquo; (John 14:20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you
desire, and it shall be done for you.&amp;rdquo; (John 15:7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-is-no-reluctance&#34;&gt;There is no reluctance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to
give you the kingdom.&amp;quot; Luke 12:32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may
be glorified in the Son.&amp;rdquo; John 14:13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-is-no-need-for-persuasion&#34;&gt;There is no need for persuasion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in
my name ... Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be
complete.&amp;quot; John 16:23&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-is-no-need-to-inform-god-about-our-needs&#34;&gt;There is no need to inform God about our needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore do not heap up empty words like the heathen. For your
Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.&amp;rdquo; Matthew
6:8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-is-no-need-to-shout&#34;&gt;There is no need to shout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shouting prayers is how the unbelieving heathen behave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or
he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened. 1
Ki 18:26-27&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-is-need-to-rest&#34;&gt;There is need to rest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait on the LORD; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your
heart; wait, I say, on the LORD!&amp;quot; Psalm 27:14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But those who wait on the LORD shall renew their strength; they
shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be
weary, they shall walk and not faint.&amp;quot; Isaiah 40:31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with
perseverance. Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. Rom
8:25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-teaches-us-to-expect-yes-as-the-answer&#34;&gt;Jesus teaches us to expect &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; as the answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite apparent that Jesus knew His followers would have great
difficulty with the idea that prayer works; at least 25 times in the
gospels Jesus urged His disciples to believe that God answers prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six times in one breath Jesus reiterated this simple truth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and
it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who
seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.&amp;rdquo; Matthew 7:7-8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can hardly escape the conclusion that Jesus intended His disciples to
approach God in prayer with the assurance and confidence that they would
obtain what they asked. This conclusion is overwhelmingly reinforced
when the other recorded words of Jesus concerning answered prayer are
considered. Just look at this selection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning
anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in
heaven.&amp;rdquo; Mat 18:19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.&amp;rdquo; Mat
21:22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray,
believe that you receive them, and you will have them.&amp;rdquo; Mark 11:24&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may
be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do
it.&amp;rdquo; John 14:13-14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you
desire, and it shall be done for you.&amp;rdquo; John 15:7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you
should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that
whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you.&amp;rdquo; John 15:16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to
you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. Until
now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that
your joy may be full.&amp;rdquo; John 16:23-24&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth concerning prayer is that God answers. Nothing more
complicated than this simple truth is required as the foundation for
faith in prayer. From this truth we draw the motivation to seek God and
to pursue the degree of abiding and intimacy in which answered prayer is
a regular experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;god-listens-to-our-heart-not-our-words&#34;&gt;God listens to our Heart, not our words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut
your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your
Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. And when you pray,
do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that
they will be heard for their many words. Therefore do not be like
them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask
Him.&amp;rdquo; Matthew 6:6-8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all
these things shall be added to you&amp;rsquo; Matthew 6:33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to
those who ask Him!&amp;quot; Matthew 7:11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prayer-is-how-the-job-gets-done&#34;&gt;Prayer is how the Job gets Done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The harvest truly is plentiful, but the labourers are few. Therefore
pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into His
harvest.&amp;rdquo; Matthew 9:37-38&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you
might go and bear fruit&amp;mdash;fruit that will last&amp;mdash;and so that whatever
you ask in my name the Father will give you. John 15:16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to
him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will
see that they get justice, and quickly. Luke 18:7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pray for us ... so that I may be restored to you the sooner.&amp;quot; Heb
13:18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word&amp;quot; Col
4:3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prayer-is-often-difficult&#34;&gt;Prayer is often difficult&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-is-unnatural&#34;&gt;It is unnatural&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing that you are in intimate communion with the God of the
Universe whom you cannot see, hear or feel is a pretty stupid delusion
according to normal human reason. It&#39;s not like any other kind of
relationship we have experienced. Is it surprising that we often find
prayer difficult?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God,
for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they
are spiritually discerned. 1 Cor 2:14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;answers-may-take-time-coming&#34;&gt;Answers may take time coming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A part of the mystery of prayer is that intercession takes time. God
does not tell us why, He just tells us that it does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out
to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he
will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of
Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&amp;quot; Luke 18:7-8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God promises to answer quickly the prayers of those who cry out day and
night. The intercession of Jesus and the Holy Spirit are ongoing and
persistent. As we share in that intercession we also need to share in
persistence until we know we have our answer or we actually see the
answer. This also is a matter of hearing God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of a delay we must be like God &amp;quot;who calls things that are
not as if they were&amp;quot; (Rom 4:18) and like Abraham grow strong in our
faith as we give glory to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-we-dont-know-how-to-pray&#34;&gt;When we don&#39;t know how to pray&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 8:26-27 describes the Holy Spirit interceding with groans that
cannot be uttered when we don&#39;t know how to pray as we ought. This is
the Holy Spirit interceding on our behalf, or through us on behalf of
another.  This is a kind of praying in the Spirit, usually in tongues,
or sometimes with literal groans. Again it must be with faith, and it
usually feels like labouring in prayer, with an eventual sense of
completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul describes travailing in prayer for the Galatians as if in child
birth (Gal 4:19).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-1----why-doesnt-god-stop-the-trouble-in-the-world&#34;&gt;Part 1 &amp;ndash; Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t God stop the trouble in the world?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God is so powerful and loving, why doesn&amp;rsquo;t He do something about the
innocent who suffer for the guilty, the global injustice and the
collapse of standards of right or wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is it that God has to stop? It&amp;rsquo;s people! It&amp;rsquo;s hatred, violence,
lust, selfishness, dishonesty and a whole host of other things in
people. So the question is &amp;ldquo;are you prepared to let God stop these
things in you?&amp;rdquo; The issue is essentially a personal one. What about
&lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; selfishness, &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; jealousy, &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; greed? If you will not let
God change you, then you have the answer to &amp;ldquo;Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t God stop the
trouble?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain &amp;ndash; that God will stop it all one day; and if we
refuse to let God into our lives to forgive us and change us then
inevitably we will be judged and found guilty. If God appears to be
inactive now, it is because He is dealing with people in &lt;em&gt;mercy&lt;/em&gt; instead
of judgement. He is giving you and me the chance to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-is-the-christian-message&#34;&gt;So what is the Christian message?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most famous expression of the Christian message is Jesus&#39; own words
recorded in &lt;strong&gt;John 3:16&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;For God so loved the world that he gave his
one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have
eternal life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clearly needs a little explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, our maker, wants to restore our relationship with Him, which we
have broken by choosing to go our own way. In going our own way we end
up doing all kinds of wrong. God sent Jesus to warn us that our wrong
doing would lead, when we die, to a terrible punishment from God, which
He called Hell. Jesus came to save us from this punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God loves us so much that He sent His Son Jesus to take the punishment
that we deserve. Jesus&#39; death on the cross was not the failure of His
mission that it seemed; it was in fact the fulfilment of His mission:
the self-sacrifice of God the Son taking the punishment for all our
wrongs upon Himself. Since our penalty has been paid, God is able to
forgive us and restore our relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has acted to save us from Hell, but to benefit from His provision we
have to make our response. We must acknowledge our guilt, ask God for
forgiveness and commit ourselves to living His way instead of ours. In
choosing God&amp;rsquo;s way we can enjoy a new relationship with Him which will
go on forever, even after we die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this booklet explores and explains these things further so
that a person wanting to be restored to God might truly find Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;heading-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-2----what-is-salvation&#34;&gt;Part 2 &amp;ndash; What is Salvation?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have probably heard the expression &amp;ldquo;born again Christian&amp;rdquo; but what
does it mean? Jesus used the expression &amp;lsquo;born again&amp;rsquo; to describe what it
is like to become a Christian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;John
3:3&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This expression was used by Jews to describe someone who converted to
Judaism&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; . A Gentile who was circumcised and baptised and vowed to be
subject to the Law of Moses was considered to be a new person. All of
their previous identity, including any sins and even any financial debts
were forgotten. The old person had died and the convert was born again
as a Jew. Jesus used this same language to speak of those who follow Him
in &lt;strong&gt;John 3:1-12&lt;/strong&gt;. To become a true Christian is to be born again, to
be forgiven all past sin and have a new start. But salvation is more
than a new start and it involves more than a simple decision. This study
is designed to help you understand both what is involved in salvation
and how you can fully enter into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;salvation-in-four-parts&#34;&gt;Salvation in four parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bible describes four distinct parts of salvation. They are known as
election, justification, sanctification and glorification (see &lt;strong&gt;Romans
8:30&lt;/strong&gt;). These are not words in common usage and so need some
explanation. A Christian continually grows in both understanding and
experience of salvation and only a basic grasp of these ideas is
required for someone wanting to become a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;election-which-happens-before-we-become-a-christian&#34;&gt;Election (which happens before we become a Christian)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who become Christians recognise that they had not been
seeking God as much as God had been pursuing them! C. S. Lewis tells of
a non-Christian friend who wrote to him, worried because he found that
most of his friends were Christians and that he was becoming unsure of
his committed atheist stand. Lewis wrote back saying that it sounded as
if the Holy Spirit was after him and that he doubted if he would get
away. This is election. It is God taking the initiative to reveal
himself to people who thought that they were not interested. Jesus said
that &amp;ldquo;No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;John 6:44&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;justification-which-happens-when-we-become-a-christian&#34;&gt;Justification (which happens when we become a Christian)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having got our attention and convinced us of our need for salvation, God
invites us to turn to Him and accept the death of Jesus as God&amp;rsquo;s payment
for our sin. Accepting Jesus means we must reject our attempts at
self-righteousness and say &amp;ldquo;I am a sinner worthy of God&amp;rsquo;s wrath but
Jesus paid the penalty for me so that I can go free.&amp;rdquo; Justification
means that God looks at us and says &amp;ldquo;There is a sinner who was on the
road to hell, but he/she has accepted My payment for his/her sin so that
I am now able to love them freely, even though they are still far from
perfect.&amp;rdquo; (See &lt;strong&gt;Romans 5:1&lt;/strong&gt;) Some people use the phrase &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s
just-as-if-I&amp;rsquo;d never sinned&amp;rdquo; to remind them what &amp;lsquo;justified&amp;rsquo; means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential fact of our justification is that Jesus&#39; death on the
cross justifies us and not our efforts to be good. We are &amp;lsquo;born again&amp;rsquo;
when we are justified. Jesus said that in order to enter the kingdom of
God (be born again), one must be born of water (baptism) and Spirit
(receiving the Holy Spirit) (&lt;strong&gt;John 3:5&lt;/strong&gt;). It is not simply a matter of
what we believe, or of praying a particular prayer, it is a process
involving God&amp;rsquo;s work and our response resulting in a new life &amp;ndash; a
justified life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctification-which-happens-whilst-we-grow-as-a-christian&#34;&gt;Sanctification (which happens whilst we grow as a Christian)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not become Christians by being good, but we cannot grow as
Christians by staying bad. One of the things that we discover as we grow
in the faith is that God does not want to take away our enjoyment of
life, rather, He wants to save us from those things which harm us.
Sanctification is the process of breaking the pattern of independence
from God so that we become more like Christ. It is a work of the Holy
Spirit in our lives and is a wonderfully liberating experience (See
&lt;strong&gt;Philippians 1:6&lt;/strong&gt;). It is mostly a gradual thing, though there are
often periods of rapid growth. We can co-operate with God in this or
oppose Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;glorification-which-happens-after-we-die-as-a-christian&#34;&gt;Glorification (which happens after we die as a Christian)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climax of the Christian faith is what happens after we die. It is
not just &amp;lsquo;pie in the sky&amp;rsquo; or harp strumming. We are presented to Jesus
as part of His &amp;lsquo;bride&amp;rsquo; and receive all the glory that you could imagine
would be given to the bride of the King of the universe! We do not know
all the detail concerning this, but we know enough to provide great hope
and motivation in this life (See &lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 1:3-6&lt;/strong&gt;). You will learn much
more about our glorification as you grow in faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-3----how-do-i-become-a-christian&#34;&gt;Part 3 &amp;ndash; How do I become a Christian?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian life is established upon the &amp;lsquo;foundation of &lt;em&gt;repentance&lt;/em&gt;
from dead works and of &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; toward God, of the doctrine of
&lt;em&gt;baptisms&lt;/em&gt;, of &lt;em&gt;laying on of hands&lt;/em&gt; (receiving the Holy Spirit), of
&lt;em&gt;resurrection&lt;/em&gt; of the dead, and of eternal &lt;em&gt;judgement&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews
6:1-2&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first four parts of this foundation &amp;ndash; repentance, faith, baptism
and receiving the Holy &amp;ndash; are the essential acts or experiences required
to become a Christian. Resurrection and eternal judgement are important
teachings which are intended to lead us to conviction of our
independence from God and to repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;repentance-in-three-parts&#34;&gt;Repentance in three parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance refers to a change of heart producing a change of direction.
When God reveals to us that an attitude or act comes from a proud
independence from God, is harmful, and we have a deep desire to change
to become more like Christ, then we are experiencing repentance. It is
not something that happens only once but it is an ongoing experience of
God&amp;rsquo;s work in our lives. Repentance involves conviction, confession and
changed behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before explaining these three aspects of repentance consider this
illustration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may remember the Chinoble nuclear power station disaster. The
surrounding area was badly contaminated with radioactive particles
rendering it unsuitable for habitation. Suppose a family living there
had their granny living with them who loved her garden and could not be
persuaded to leave. The local authority had distributed warning leaflets
explaining the invisible peril and its inevitable result of terminal
cancer and the urgent need for people to move out of the area. They
provided alternative accommodation for the displaced people and
transport etc. But granny cannot see or feel the radiation and thinks
its just a government ploy to get them off land that they want to
redevelop. The family tries desperately to convince her but she will not
be convinced of her peril. They move away to safety leaving granny with
her garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks all her flowers have gone spotty, all the birds have
died and granny slowly realises that her continual stomach upset is
getting worse rather than better. She recognises the reality of the
radiation and the truth of all the warnings and so is &lt;em&gt;convicted&lt;/em&gt; of her
hardness of heart in refusing the pleadings of her family. She
&lt;em&gt;confesses&lt;/em&gt; to them that she is now ready to heed their warnings. She
packs her bags and moves away. She is convicted, confesses her change of
heart and changes her behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conviction&#34;&gt;Conviction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conviction is being convinced of something. God wants to convince us of
our guilt before Him and our need for salvation. Yet the purpose of
conviction is not to make us feel like convicts but to show us God&amp;rsquo;s
perspective on our lives, so that we can see our need and turn to God
for help. God&amp;rsquo;s aim is not to leave us feeling guilty but to turn us
from our sin and remove our guilt and shame (see &lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians
7:9-10&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people will readily accept that their lives are not perfect and
even that they have made a mess of them, but many have no recognition of
their guilt before God. They cannot see what their lives have to do with
God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not so difficult to see that we could benefit from some help from
God to live better lives. There may be a sudden dawning upon us that the
way we have lived our lives has caused great harm to ourselves or
others. We may feel regret or remorse for things we have done. It is
often the unpleasant consequences of sin or weaknesses in our character
that we regret and which may cause us to look to God for a remedy. We
may recognise our need for help to sort out our lives and turn to God to
obtain that help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is good to recognise, but it is basically man-centred. It does
not get to the heart of the problem which is that our greatest and most
serious sin has been against God Himself. True repentance recognises, as
the Psalmist did, that &amp;ldquo;Against You God, You only, have I sinned, and
done what is evil in Your sight&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 51:4&lt;/strong&gt;) &amp;ndash; this is conviction.
It is God Himself that should take centre stage in repentance, not us.
The gospel is not &lt;em&gt;primarily&lt;/em&gt; concerned with putting our lives back
together, but with putting our relationship with God back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance requires an understanding of the true nature of sin. We tend
to think of sin in terms of acts that are ultimately harmful to
ourselves or others, especially where they are harmful to loving and
open relationships. Thus, for instance, I sin if I lie to you. But this
is not God&amp;rsquo;s definition of sin. God defines sin as our living in
independence from Him. Even if we do wonderful good, if it is done in
independence from God, we commit sin. It is not the &lt;em&gt;good deeds&lt;/em&gt; that
are sinful, but our &lt;em&gt;independence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created Adam and Eve for relationship with Him. Satan tempted them
with a promise that eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil would enable them to &amp;ldquo;be like God&amp;rdquo; so that they would no
longer be dependant upon Him (&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 3:5&lt;/strong&gt;). This is the issue at the
heart of repentance. Our sin is in living our lives without depending
upon God for guidance and strength and in so doing, preferring our
fallen wisdom above His boundless love. In our ignorance and blindness
we accuse God of being uncaring or incompetent when in fact He is our
maker and the one person in all creation who loves us with unfaltering
passion and care. Thus, it is primarily against Him that we sin whilst
we make a mess of our lives through doing it our own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because true repentance is focussed on our sin against God, whom we
cannot see, it requires revelation. Revelation of this perspective on
our sin is the purpose of conviction. It is a work of the Holy Spirit
which we should earnestly ask Him to do in our hearts. It is also a
process that starts around the time we are born-again and should
continue throughout our walk with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conviction of the true nature of our sin is thus a precursor to
repentance. Conviction that makes true repentance possible is evidenced
by three signs&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awareness of a wrong relationship with God: not just with one&amp;rsquo;s
neighbour or one&amp;rsquo;s own conscience, but with one&amp;rsquo;s Maker; the God on
whom one depends for existence every moment. It is the awareness of
being in a broken relationship with God that spells rejection and
wrath and which, whatever the cost, must be restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awareness of personal guilt and responsibility for specific sins
from which one needs to turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awareness of personal sinfulness; of having a corrupt nature from
which one needs deliverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 51&lt;/strong&gt; is a psalm of conviction and repentance and may help to
elicit or explain conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;confession&#34;&gt;Confession&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being born again as a Christian is the beginning of a new life, not just
a new experience or interest in our life. This new life comes about
through our death to our old life. Baptism (see below) is our public
witness to the fact that through faith in Jesus, we have identified
ourselves with Him in His death upon the cross and also with His
resurrection. We have died to our old way of life and have received new
spiritual life by receiving the Holy Spirit. If, through the conviction
of the Holy Spirit, we recognise that we have lived in rebellion towards
God then we will want to turn away from our past sinful attitudes and
behaviour as much as we are able. Confession of our sin helps us to do
this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul talks about us being slaves to sin in our past life
(&lt;strong&gt;Romans 6:16-23&lt;/strong&gt;). Jesus breaks the power of sin and allows us to
walk free from these &amp;ldquo;yokes of bondage&amp;rdquo;. Paul urges us not to get
entangled with them again (&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 5:1&lt;/strong&gt;). If we do carry these
yokes into our new life with Christ, it is never too late to deal with
them, but surely it is better to start our new life free from the yokes
that have bound us &amp;ndash; and then make sure we don&amp;rsquo;t pick them up again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confession helps us to start our new life as unburdened as possible. The
purpose is not simply to get guilt off our chest, but sin out of our
lives. Confession of sin is the acknowledgement of our guilt with the
firm intention of changing. Confession of specific sins is necessary so
as to avoid vague generalities which leave the heart unchanged: &amp;ldquo;If we
confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/strong&gt;). This may be with
someone else present or on our own before God and is best verbalised
rather than just thought. Confession of our sin should not leave us
feeling exposed, but wonderfully clean. For someone becoming a
Christian, there are probably four specific areas of confession to be
considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;confessing-self-righteousness-pride&#34;&gt;Confessing self-righteousness (pride)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements of self-righteousness are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accusing God&lt;/strong&gt; of injustice or unfaithfulness or lack of love.
This places us in the position of judge over God which is
unbelievably arrogant, but very common, even normal! (See &lt;strong&gt;Romans
9:20-21&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbelief&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not simply a lack of faith. It is a wilful
disregard of the facts and evidence of Jesus&amp;rsquo; life in favour of
disbelief for the purpose of avoiding conviction of sin or personal
responsibility. God &lt;em&gt;commands&lt;/em&gt; belief (&lt;strong&gt;1 John 3:23&lt;/strong&gt;) and condemns
unbelief (&lt;strong&gt;Mark 16:14,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 3:12&lt;/strong&gt;). Unbelief is ultimately
an issue of the heart, not the head; that is, it is usually a moral
rather than an intellectual problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excusing ourselves&lt;/strong&gt;, thinking that we are not too bad. This is
self deception, keeping us from calling upon God for salvation and
preventing us from putting our trust in Jesus for our justification.
Many people are afraid of admitting their sin because they are
afraid of condemnation, but, in fact, it is the very act of
justifying ourselves that makes condemnation such a threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 64:6&lt;/strong&gt; But we are all like an unclean thing, and all our
righteousness is like filthy rags; we all fade as a leaf, and our
iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. (See also
&lt;strong&gt;Philippians 3:8-9&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self righteousness stops us from receiving the forgiveness and peace
of Christ. It needs careful attention and you may need a Christian
to help you recognise and repent from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;confessing-ungodly-behaviour&#34; class=&#34;list-paragraph&#34;&gt;Confessing ungodly behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to common belief, Christianity is not for &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo; people, but
for bad people who know they need help. You may find that you are caught
up in all sorts of situations that involve ungodly behaviour; perhaps
being under pressure to fiddle forms at work or claiming unlawful
benefits or involvement in an ungodly relationship. You do not have to
put all this right before you can become a Christian, but you do need to
come with a genuine desire to have God help you sort your life out. A
first step is to confess to God everything that you know about which you
think is wrong in your life and ask Him to help you live His way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;confessing-unforgiveness-towards-others&#34; class=&#34;list-paragraph&#34;&gt;Confessing unforgiveness towards others&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said that if we don&amp;rsquo;t forgive others, then He will not forgive us
(&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 6:14&lt;/strong&gt;). If we are asking God to forgive us for all that we
have done and thought wrong, then we must also be prepared to forgive
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;everyone, everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that they have done to us. Again, you do not
have to get this all sorted out before you become a Christian, but you
must &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to get it all sorted out, and confessing the situations
to God is an important first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;confessing-occult-involvement&#34; class=&#34;list-paragraph&#34;&gt;Confessing occult involvement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great many people have had some sort of occult involvement and, as
much as is possible, any known involvement must be specifically
confessed, renounced and turned from. If you, or any close family member
or ancestor, are known to have been involved in anything in the list
below, this should be made known to a responsible, experienced Christian
since there may be the need for further help in coming to repentance and
gaining freedom from all occult influence. Any addictions, dependencies,
compulsions and mental problems should be shared in case they have
occult roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A-Z of &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; occult influences&lt;/strong&gt;: astrology, automatic writing,
bestiality, black or white magic, blood pacts, charms, clairvoyance,
cults (including Christian science, J.W.&amp;rsquo;s etc.), divining, E.S.P.,
eastern meditation, exclusive Christian fellowships, faith healing,
fantasy games (e.g. Dungeons and dragons), fortune telling, freemasonry,
homosexuality, horoscopes, hypnosis, levitation, martial arts (e.g.
karate), mediums, metaphysics, mysticism, necromancy, new age medicine
(all alternative treatments should be mentioned as some are occult
based) , new age philosophy, occult literature, Ouija boards, paganism,
pornography, science fiction (some are occult based), sexual perversion,
seances, superstitions, Tarot cards, telepathy, trances, Transcendental
meditation, witchcraft, Yoga, Zodiac charms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer for possible occult influences is best shared with at least two
mature Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;changed-behaviour-the-evidence-of-repentance&#34; class=&#34;list-paragraph&#34;&gt;Changed behaviour &amp;ndash; the evidence of repentance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that sin is defined as living in independence from God shows us
that repentance means that we must now trust God as Lord of our lives.
That means referring our decisions to Him, asking and trusting Him for
guidance and obeying His will as He reveals it to us. This is not simply
religious jargon. It is a practical day to day working out of a whole
new way of conducting our lives in relation to God rather than in
isolation from God. It is not simply bringing God into our lives, but
rather, bringing our lives to God. The Lordship of Christ starts with
repentance and is worked out as we grow in our relationship with God
over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance must be specific and have its fruits and not be just an
intellectual generality. Reasonable evidence of repentance is required
before a person is baptised (See &lt;strong&gt;Luke 3:8&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Acts 26:20&lt;/strong&gt;), but
perfection is not to be expected! Repentance does not guarantee that we
will not continue to commit the same sins (that may take some time and
good biblical teaching), but repentance does produce a genuine desire to
stop living in independence from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was in no hurry to press people into the kingdom, on the contrary,
He turned away those who were half hearted. Jesus required devotion and
obedience, not just sentimental expressions of &amp;ldquo;Oh yes! I believe in
Jesus&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Luke 14:26-33, Luke 18:18-26&lt;/strong&gt;). Jesus requires us to walk in
the light; to be truthful with Him and with one another (&lt;strong&gt;John
3:19-21&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;1 John 1:5-7&lt;/strong&gt;). We are required to forgive and accept
others if we are to receive forgiveness from God (&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 6:14, Romans
15:7&lt;/strong&gt;). And we are to love one another in the body of Christ deeply,
with a sincere heart (&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 1:22&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These requirements are not burdensome to those who have understood their
need for salvation and who know that God loves them unconditionally and
has their best interests at heart (see &lt;strong&gt;John 14:21,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 John 5:3&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is repentance: conviction, confession and changed behaviour. It
is the first part of the process of becoming a Christian. The second
part is to believe; to start trusting God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;faith&#34; class=&#34;list-paragraph&#34;&gt;Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is not blind belief in the unlikely or impossible, nor is it based
upon feelings. On the contrary, faith is firmly based upon facts. It is
the &lt;em&gt;facts&lt;/em&gt; that are believed that are effective, not the &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; of
believing, but for us to &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; from those facts we do have to
believe them and put our trust in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament there is one Greek word (&lt;em&gt;pistis&lt;/em&gt;) which, as a
verb, is generally translated &amp;lsquo;believe&amp;rsquo; and, as a noun, &amp;lsquo;faith&amp;rsquo;. Faith
is what you have if you believe the facts sufficiently to actually
&lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; them. When a man let Blondin wheel him in a barrow across the
Niagara Falls on a tight rope it was an act of trust based upon
confident belief which in turn was based on sound facts (he had just
seen him walk across with terrific confidence). This kind of trust is
what the bible means by &amp;lsquo;faith&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo;. It is evident that the
safety of the man in the barrow depended not on his faith, but on the
truth of the claim that Blondin made about his ability. Given that God&amp;rsquo;s
claims are true, our experience of them depends upon our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;He who believes in Me has everlasting life.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;John
6:47&lt;/strong&gt;) but what exactly must be believed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus is God&amp;rsquo;s Son and our saviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;John 20:31&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God is who He says He is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has
everlasting life, and shall not come into judgement, but has passed
from death into life.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;John 5:24&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus was raised from the dead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your
heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Romans 10:9&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are justified by Jesus&#39; death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our right-standing with God comes from God, through faith in Jesus
Christ, as a gift to all who believe. There is no difference between
&lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; people and &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; people; for all have sinned and fall short of
the glory of God. We are put right with God freely through faith in His
provision &amp;ndash; His Son who, through His death, took the penalty for our
rebellion against God upon Himself. By this means, God was able to
deliver us from the penalty for our sin without denying its seriousness.
He rightly judged us guilty and worthy of death, but provided His own
Son to die in place of those who put their trust in Jesus&#39; death.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Romans 3:22-26,&lt;/strong&gt; my paraphrase)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having understood the facts concerning salvation, and having come to a
place of believing them, we can only benefit from God&amp;rsquo;s saving action by
putting our trust in Him. We must call out in prayer to God for Him to
cleanse our hearts, forgive us our rebellion against Him and give us a
new start. Repeating a set prayer is probably not the most meaningful
way that a repentant soul can call on God for salvation! It should be a
personal appeal to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baptism&#34;&gt;Baptism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus commanded His followers to be baptised: &amp;ldquo;Go therefore and make
disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mat 28:19&lt;/strong&gt;). Baptism is not
optional for a believer; Jesus commanded it and so did the apostles:
&amp;ldquo;And he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord (&lt;strong&gt;Acts
10:48&lt;/strong&gt;). When the apostle Paul believed in Jesus, Ananias said to him,
&amp;ldquo;And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptised, and wash away your
sins, calling on the name of the Lord.&amp;rdquo; (= call out to God on the basis
of Jesus&#39; death.) (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 22:16&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is an intrinsic part of becoming a Christian. The gospel message
is to &amp;ldquo;repent &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and be baptised&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 2:38&lt;/strong&gt;). In the New
Testament, baptism is the immediate outward act which signifies faith in
Jesus. There was no question of delaying baptism until after a course of
teaching or until elaborate arrangements were made. The nearest suitable
pool of water was utilised to confirm a person&amp;rsquo;s faith by baptism (see
&lt;strong&gt;Acts 8:36-38&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years the church has tended to depart from the New Testament
practice of baptism, either by not baptising believers or by separating
it in time or understanding from the moment of coming to faith in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-if-i-was-baptised-as-an-infant&#34;&gt;What if I was baptised as an infant?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have been &lt;em&gt;christened&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;baptised&lt;/em&gt; as infants and may
wonder if they should be baptised as believers when they come to put
their trust in Jesus. Jesus commanded that those who put their faith in
Jesus should be baptised and we strongly urge believers to begin their
life of obedience to Christ by obeying His command to be baptised. (Even
Jesus, who was faithfully circumcised in the temple as a baby insisted
that He be baptised as a believer, &lt;strong&gt;Mark 3:13-17&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-is-baptism&#34;&gt;What is baptism?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Testament times baptism was an everyday occurrence. There were
baptism baths at every synagogue and in many larger homes. Devout Jews
would baptise themselves daily in an act of ritual washing (see &lt;strong&gt;Heb
9:10&lt;/strong&gt;). Baptism was also used to signify that a person was devoted to a
particular Rabbi (&lt;strong&gt;Jn 3:23ff, Acts 19:3&lt;/strong&gt;). Baptism was usually
self-administered by fully immersing oneself in a bath or pool, but when
this was not possible drenching with buckets of water was
acceptable.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism (Greek &lt;em&gt;baptizo&lt;/em&gt; usually means to be fully immersed in water,
like a sunken ship) is a physical event with a spiritual effect. It is
not merely a sign or symbol, but an integral part of the process of
conversion. Through baptism, God washes us from the presence and effect
of our sin, so that we have a clean conscience before God (see below &lt;strong&gt;2
Peter 3:21, Titus 3:5&lt;/strong&gt;). In baptism we identify ourselves with Christ
in His death and resurrection. We die to our old lives and are &amp;lsquo;born
again&amp;rsquo; as God&amp;rsquo;s children:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that
just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of life&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Romans 6:4&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-does-baptism-do&#34;&gt;What does Baptism do?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism has a number of different aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obedience.&lt;/strong&gt; Baptism is to be completely covered and saturated by
the medium in which we are baptised. Baptism in water means we are
covered by the water. Baptism in Jesus means that we are submerged
in Jesus, saturated by His life and submitted to His Lordship.
Baptism seals our intention to be obedient to Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleansed conscience&lt;/strong&gt;. We submerge ourselves in water in order to
cleans ourselves. Baptism in Jesus washes us from our sin and guilt.
In fact it is the Holy Spirit who does this washing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be baptised and wash your sins away&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 22:16&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1
Corinthians 6:11&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the
Holy Spirit&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Titus 3:5&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Baptism is not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the appeal
of a good conscience toward God through the resurrection of Jesus
Christ&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1 Pet 3:21&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death to our sinful nature&lt;/strong&gt;. Going under the water symbolises the
end of our previous life. Baptism in Jesus is an identification with
His death on the cross. &amp;ldquo;Do you not know that all of us who were
baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into His death?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Romans
6:3&lt;/strong&gt;). This is not the bad news that it sounds like. It is
amazingly good news. No other god offers death as a means to life.
It is the stubborn grip with which we grasp our own lives which
prevents us from receiving God&amp;rsquo;s life. Sin is an addiction for which
there is only one cure ‑ death! Everyone will be cured one day.
Everyone will die. But Christ offers us the opportunity to die right
now instead of having to wait for the end of our lives. It is
incredible. In this day when everything is instant and people are
not interested if you cannot give them what they want straight away,
you offer them the chance of instant death and they say &amp;ldquo;No thanks,
I prefer to wait for the end of my life&amp;rdquo;. They do not know what they
are missing! Jesus says to us &amp;ldquo;You know that habit you are
struggling with, you know that thing you are addicted to, you know
those reactions you cannot control... well, you can die right now
in Me so that those things will no longer enslave you.&amp;rdquo; Well, I say,
&amp;ldquo;If my flesh is condemned to die anyway, and it is only a hindrance
to me, then let me die!&amp;rdquo; Baptism is our acceptance of this amazing
offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New life&lt;/strong&gt;. When we come up out of the water it is like a new
birth. &amp;ldquo;We were buried with Him through baptism into death in order
that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the
Father, we too may live a new life&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Romans 6:4&lt;/strong&gt;). Jesus not only
provides baptism in water for our death, but He is the water of
Life. Even though we die with Christ, it is completely impossible
for us to remain dead. All the mighty power of God is at work in
Christ to make us alive (&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 1:19‑20, 2:6&lt;/strong&gt;). It is quite
simply impossible for any one to resist that power. If we have died
with Christ than we are also raised up with Him. The power that
raised up Him who bore the sin of the whole world should just about
be able to manage the burden of my sin! We do not have to try to be
resurrected with Christ, God raises us up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A changed nature&lt;/strong&gt;. God does not make us better &amp;ndash; He makes us
new! We do not receive the kiss of life. God has not condemned our
flesh only to bring it back to life again. Resurrection is not
restoration. God does not look at us and say, &amp;ldquo;We will put a patch
on here, and replace that bit of rot there, oil this bit and polish
that bit.&amp;rdquo; No! God says &amp;ldquo;Yuk, that old life is disgusting. We can&amp;rsquo;t
do anything with that. It is beyond repair. Look, you had better
have a new life. Here, have mine.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 5:17&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;If anyone
is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has
come.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 4:24&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Put on the new nature, created to be like
God in true righteousness and holiness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discipleship&lt;/strong&gt;. Baptism was a Jewish custom indicating that you
were giving your allegiance to a particular teacher. In the
Corinthian church some of the brothers were saying &amp;ldquo;I follow Paul&amp;rdquo;,
some &amp;ldquo;I follow Apollos&amp;rdquo; and some &amp;ldquo;I follow Cephas&amp;rdquo; and the super
spiritual ones &amp;ldquo;I follow Christ, so there!&amp;rdquo; So Paul says &amp;ldquo;Were you
baptised into Paul? Christ did not send me to baptise but to preach
the gospel&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 1:12&lt;/strong&gt;‑&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt;). The early Christians
had to learn that baptism was not to symbolise their allegiance to a
particular preacher, congregation or theological position, but their
allegiance to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said that we were to &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Make disciples&lt;/strong&gt; ... and baptise them&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 28:19&lt;/strong&gt;). He did not say &amp;ldquo;Make converts, baptise them and
disciple those who will let you.&amp;rdquo; Conversion (what ever that means) is
not the issue. It is discipleship. &amp;ldquo;He who hears these words of mine
and does them, he is My disciple&amp;rdquo;. Baptism is the first act of
obedience in a life devoted to obedience to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Declaration of our faith.&lt;/strong&gt; Baptism is a declaration before
witnesses (usually church, family and friends) that you have
identified yourself with the death and resurrection of Jesus, who
died to set you free from your sin and rose to give you new life.
The person being baptised often wants to invite friends and family
along. However, baptism should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be seen primarily as an
evangelistic event. It is first and foremost a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;personal
spiritual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; event in which the past is buried, the conscience
cleansed and the power of the Holy Spirit received. The depth and
reality of this spiritual experience should be paramount even in a
large evangelistic event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism, then, means submission, repentance, death to the old life,
being filled with His life, putting on the new nature and loving and
obeying Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said that it was fitting to fulfil all righteousness in being
baptised. And when He was baptised the Holy Spirit came upon Him, and
God said &amp;ldquo;This is My Son in whom I am well pleased.&amp;rdquo; When we give
ourselves to die and be raised again with Christ, Jesus says &amp;ldquo;I died for
you, and I am so glad that I did!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having repented, started to believe and trust God, received the Holy
Spirit and been baptised in water, you have completed the four steps of
becoming a Christian; you have been &amp;lsquo;born again&amp;rsquo; and can look forward to
growing in your faith as you are sanctified by the ongoing work of the
Holy Spirit and look forward to your eventual glorification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;receiving-the-holy-spirit&#34;&gt;Receiving the Holy Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having repented, believed, called on God for salvation and begun to
trust Him for His forgiveness and love, you are ready to receive the
promised Holy Spirit. This is the third stage in becoming a Christian.
It is the most crucial part of becoming a Christian. It is the Holy
Spirit who makes us a child of God. Everything else is preparing the way
for us to receive Him. It is a definite experience which usually
precedes, but sometimes follows, water baptism, but never in the New
Testament are the two events simultaneous&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the Holy Spirit who gives us new life &amp;ndash; new-birth: Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;I
tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is
born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit
gives birth to spirit&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;(John 3:5-6).&lt;/strong&gt; He said that after He had been
glorified (ascended into heaven after His resurrection) the Holy Spirit
would be given to those who put their trust in Him (&lt;strong&gt;John 7:38-39,
14:16,26, 15:26&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the
Counsellor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;(John 16:7)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit is God&amp;rsquo;s seal and guarantee that we have been adopted as
His children (see &lt;strong&gt;Romans 8:16,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 1:13-14,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 John
4:13&lt;/strong&gt;). His presence within us is a witness to the powers of darkness
that we belong to God, forbidding them power over our lives. It is also
an inner witness to us as we recognise the Spirit within us crying out
&amp;ldquo;Father&amp;rdquo; to our heavenly Father, bearing witness that we are His
children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also He washes and renews our hearts and conscience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because
of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal
by the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Titus 3:5&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He helps us in our weakness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to
pray, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groans that words
can not express.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;(Romans 8:26)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I pray that He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in
your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through
faith.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;(Ephesians 3:16-17)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives us hope and joy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so
that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;(Romans 15:13)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives life to our mortal bodies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you,
He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal
bodies through His Spirit, who lives in you.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Romans 8:11&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reveals the Fathers thoughts and plans for us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has
prepared for those who love him, but God has revealed it to us by His
Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 2:9-10&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He transforms us into the image of Christ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We all, with unveiled face, behold as in a mirror the glory of the
Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory,
just as by the Spirit of the Lord.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 3:18&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that we have received the Holy Spirit because He gives a witness
within our hearts that we are now a child of God (&lt;strong&gt;Romans 8:16&lt;/strong&gt;).
Things will begin to change. You will find attitudes begin to change,
believing God becomes easier, you will want to deal with sin in your
life, you will experience inner peace and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;baptism-in-the-holy-spirit&#34;&gt;Baptism in the Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be three distinct levels or experiences of receiving the
Holy Spirit, although the scriptures are not consistent in the words
used to describe them and there is much ongoing debate about it. These
are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving the &lt;strong&gt;indwelling&lt;/strong&gt; Holy Spirit at conversion by which we
cry &amp;ldquo;Abba Father&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Gal 4:6&lt;/strong&gt;). The indwelling Holy Spirit produces
a variety of godly fruits, just as the life sustaining sap in a tree
produces fruit (See &lt;strong&gt;John 15&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Galatians 5:22-23&lt;/strong&gt;). These
are real, recognisable, effective and enduring. They grow in us
rather than come upon us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being &lt;strong&gt;baptised&lt;/strong&gt; in the Holy Spirit, by which we are empowered
(&lt;strong&gt;Acts 1:8&lt;/strong&gt;) and receive gifts for building up the church (&lt;strong&gt;1
Corinthians 12-14&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being &lt;strong&gt;filled&lt;/strong&gt; with the Holy Spirit which brings a special and
temporary experience such as joy (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 13:52&lt;/strong&gt;) or revelation
(&lt;strong&gt;Acts 7:55&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having received the indwelling Holy Spirit at conversion, we should ask
God to baptise us in the Holy Spirit. This is described as a filling or
a drink (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 2:4, Ephesians 5:18,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 12:13&lt;/strong&gt;)
indicating the awareness of being filled by God and with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the Baptism in the Holy Spirit, the gifts of the Holy Spirit
become available to us. These are things such as prophecy, revelation,
visions, words of knowledge, healing, praying in tongues and
interpretation of tongues. These gifts are given by the Holy Spirit to
help us build up the church:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the
profit of all.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 12:7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts
that build up the church.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 14:12&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of
instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these
must be done for the strengthening of the church.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians
14:26&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been baptised in the Holy Spirit, we need to stir up the gifts
within us and use them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you
through the laying on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit
of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;2 Timothy
1:6-7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism in the Holy Spirit is normally received through the laying on of
hands immediately following baptism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.
And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them,
and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 19:5-6)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is usually evidenced by speaking in tongues or prophecy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in
other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;(Acts 2:4)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and
they spoke in tongues and prophesied.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;(Acts 19:6)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a person is not baptised in the Holy Spirit when they are
first prayed for, and this can be distressing, but Jesus said that we
should go on asking until He is received (&lt;strong&gt;Luke 11:13&lt;/strong&gt;). It may be
that there is some area of sin or unbelief or a curse which is hindering
the receiving of the Holy Spirit, but this will come to light as we
continue to pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit coming upon us should not be seen as a once-off
experience, but as the beginning of a lifetime of drinking and filling.
Some people seem to have powerful experiences of the Holy Spirit coming
upon them frequently, other much less frequently. The thing is to stay
thirsty and keep drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are baptised in the Holy Spirit without anyone praying for
them; God just does it! Others receive when they pray for themselves,
but most receive through others praying for them. Sometimes we may have
to persevere in prayer for some time (&amp;ldquo;Ask, seek, knock &amp;hellip;&amp;quot;) or we may
need to call on leaders with greater authority to pray (as in Samaria).
But we should not give up praying and asking until the Holy Spirit has
clearly been given. Jesus has promised the Holy Spirit and He wants us
to be baptised in the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 Baptism in the Holy Spirit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-gifts-of-the-holy-spirit&#34;&gt;The Gifts of the Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all the blessings listed above, the Holy Spirit also
gives various gifts for building ourselves up and strengthening the
church. These are things such as prophecy, revelation, visions, words of
knowledge, healing, praying in tongues and interpretation of tongues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit
of all&amp;hellip; the message of wisdom &amp;hellip; or knowledge, faith, gifts of
healing, miraculous powers, prophecy, distinguishing between spirits,
speaking in different kinds of tongues, and the interpretation of
tongues.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 12:7-10&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction,
a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done
for the strengthening of the church.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 14:26&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been baptised in the Holy Spirit, we need to stir up the
spiritual gifts He gives us and use them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that
build up the church.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 14:12&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you
through the laying on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit of
fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;2 Timothy
1:6-7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;speaking-in-tongues&#34;&gt;Speaking in Tongues&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first gift most people receive is the gift of tongues. It is of
tremendous benefit within both corporate and personal worship allowing
the unhindered expression of our hearts to the Father without the
limitation of having to form suitable words with our minds and
understanding. It is a spirit inspired language which we cannot
understand with our minds, but which we can use at our will to worship
God, pray for situations and build up our spirits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies
the church. I would like every one of you to speak in tongues &amp;hellip; For if
I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. So what
shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my
mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. If
you are praising God with your spirit &amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 14:4-5&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;14-16&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy
Spirit.&amp;quot;**&lt;br&gt;
**(&lt;strong&gt;Jude 1:20&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism in the Holy Spirit 19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Paul says here, when speaking in tongues, our minds are not involved.
We can be thinking about anything under the sun whilst we are speaking
in tongues. Therefore, whilst speaking in tongues we should also pray
and worship God with our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who speak in tongues wonder if they are just making up
nonsense and this can put them off from using the gift. But it is
important to understand that speaking in tongues is a spiritual act of
faith which our flesh will usually object to. Remember that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the
Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 5:17&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from
the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot
understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1
Corinthians 2:14&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritual discernment grows with practice &amp;ndash; and practice implies
experimentation and getting it wrong sometimes. Even if we speak a load
of gibberish when we first try to speak in tongues, God will very soon
make it &amp;lsquo;spiritually&amp;rsquo; effective. It may be that our prophecies are
mostly from us initially &amp;ndash; but the Father will be pleased to give
maturity to these efforts so that His body may be increasingly built up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should practice using our spiritual language both on our own and in
worship together. Sometimes singing in tongues will break through our
fleshly weariness and bring us into a wonderful sense of God&amp;rsquo;s presence,
other times we may not be conscious of any benefit at the time, but
later we will reap the fruit of having persevered against the flesh in
singing or praying in tongues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;interpretation-of-tongues&#34;&gt;Interpretation of Tongues&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having started to pray and worship in tongues we should ask God for the
gift of interpretation of tongues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may
interpret what he says.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 14:13&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interpretation is not a literal word-for-word translation but the
re-phrasing of what was given in the Spirit in the words of the person
giving the interpretation. It will therefore have the characteristics of
the person giving the interpretation, but the content has been revealed
to their spirit by the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may interpret our own tongue or that given by someone else. Usually
it is a prayer or praise to God, but sometimes it is an encouragement or
instruction from God. Often, two or more people will have the same
interpretation which confirms that it is genuine. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about
getting it wrong. If you have the slightest hint that God has given you
the first word or two of an interpretation or prophecy, then say so. You
can say &amp;ldquo;I think maybe the interpretation is&amp;hellip; (or God is saying &amp;hellip;).&amp;rdquo;
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a complete picture. You may have the
beginning and someone else the rest of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;prophecy&#34;&gt;Prophecy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much that has been said about interpretation of tongues applies also to
prophecy. It is Spirit to spirit communication which we have to find
words in order to express. It will therefore be expressed through our
words, character and understanding and will inevitably be incomplete and
imperfect. But that does not make prophecy any less vital and
significant. The gift of prophecy grows through use and you should keep
stepping out in faith and let the person who is discipling you help you
to learn to discern what is from God and what is from your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 Baptism in the Holy Spirit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;other-spiritual-gifts&#34;&gt;Other Spiritual gifts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn about the other gifts as you grow in your faith. The main
thing is to keep pressing on by actively practising the gifts of
tongues, interpretation and prophecy, and responding to the Holy Spirit
whenever you think He may be prompting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;testing-the-gifts&#34;&gt;Testing the Gifts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as God wants us to be confident of His love for us, and our
acceptance in Christ, so also He wants us to be confident and secure in
the Spiritual gifts. He says that we are to test, weigh and prove the
Spiritual gifts. We are not testing God, but ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies. Test all things;
hold fast what is good.&amp;rdquo; (1 &lt;strong&gt;Thessalonians 5:16&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This testing is done by the witness of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of
the hearers, and is ultimately the responsibility of the leaders or
elders present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1
Corinthians 14:29&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-on-in-the-spirit&#34;&gt;Going on in the Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit coming upon us should not be seen as a once-off
experience, but as the beginning of a lifetime of drinking and filling.
Some people seem to have powerful experiences of the Holy Spirit coming
upon them frequently, other much less frequently. The thing is to stay
thirsty and keep drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having repented, started to believe and trust God, been baptised in
water and in the Holy Spirit, you have completed the four steps of
becoming a Christian; you have been &amp;lsquo;born again&amp;rsquo; and can look forward to
growing in your faith as you are sanctified by the ongoing work of the
Holy Spirit and look forward to your eventual glorification.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Has anyone provided proof of God&amp;rsquo;s inexistence? Not even close. Has
quantum cosmology explained the emergence of the universe or why it is
here? Not even close. Have our sciences explained why our universe seems
to be fine-tuned to allow for the existence of life? Not even close. Are
physicists and biologists willing to believe in anything so long as it
is not religious thought? Close enough. Has rationalism and moral
thought provided us with an understanding of what is good, what is
right, and what is moral? Not close enough. Has secularism in the
terrible 20th century been a force for good? Not even close, to being
close. Is there a narrow and oppressive orthodoxy in the sciences? Close
enough. Does anything in the sciences or their philosophy justify the
claim that religious belief is irrational? Not even in the ball park. Is
scientific atheism a frivolous exercise in intellectual contempt? Dead
on.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;David Berlinski, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1639458&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Devil&#39;s Delusion: Atheism and Its
Scientific Pretensions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Bang is predicted by Einstein&#39;s Field Equations, but it lacks
any cause. Something made it happen, but theory offers no suggestions as
to what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big-Bang is the instantaneous creation of space, time and matter out
of nothing. It is based on equations that describe probabilities, yet
for the universe to exist it requires a virtually infinitely improbable
minute imbalance between various types of sub-atomic particle ( a ratio
of 10^9^: 1+10^9^) and an initial density equal to a critical density to
an accuracy of 1:10^55^. Any variation from this critical density would
result in a universe that lived for only 10^-44^ seconds or consisted of
only scattered individual particles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equations of fundamental physics have no concept of &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; or of
the direction of time (past and future). Although we observe processes,
such as the increase of entropy, happening only in one direction, there
is nothing in the underlying equations to say they only happen in one
direction. Only observation supplies evidence for time having a
direction, and it poses the question &amp;ndash; where did the original &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt;
originate from? This is a question that scientific theories have no
answer for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum Theory has proved very powerful at describing observable
phenomena, including many biological processes. However its equations
require an &amp;quot;observer&amp;quot; that is outside the quantum system &amp;ndash; indeed
they strongly suggest that the observer must be conscious! Physicists
and philosophers have no solution as to how that observer can arise &amp;ndash;
what consciousness is and why it has such a decisive effect on quantum
particles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life requires water on planet earth. Yet the science of planet formation
means that any water that was present in the cosmic dust from which the
earth formed would have evaporated into space long before life could
form. It is supposed that water was delivered to earth after it cooled
sufficiently, by some asteroid from outer space. &amp;quot;Understanding how
water arrived on Earth is a key part of understanding how and when life
evolved here as well. But we don&amp;rsquo;t even know how it where it came
from.&amp;quot; (Sabrina Stierwalt, October 6, 2019 Scientific American)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All life contains DNA. The theory of evolution supposes that DNA formed
by random processes in hot springs, and that the first DNA molecule
somehow reproduced itself. No one has any theory for how DNA reproduces
itself. It has never been observed and it is now acknowledged that DNA
is incapable of reproducing itself, no matter how many nutrients are
provided or how long is allowed. (Dennis Noble, Oxford University &amp;ndash;
Music of Life lectures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary Theory asserts and depends upon several theses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA contains the instructions for making all the cells of an
organism and is solely responsible for the organism produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquired attributes (the experiences during the life of the
organism) do not affect the DNA and therefore cannot be transmitted
through reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA changes through random mutations over long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death of organisms is required to allow more successful DNA to
be reproduced more frequently than less successful DNA. This leads
to evolutionary progress and the emergence of new species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Systems Biology has demonstrated that each of these pillars is
false! (&amp;quot;What is life&amp;quot;-lecture to Karolinska Institute in Sweden:
Denis Noble, May 2014). In 2006 Dawkins published the now famous &amp;quot;The
Selfish Gene&amp;quot; which depends entirely upon Neo Darwinism and is the
basis of much so-called scientific atheism. However, in the same year
Denis Noble published &amp;quot;The Music of Life&amp;quot; in which he shows that Neo
Darwinism has been disproved and cannot be the way that life has
evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of random combinations of DNA genes is 10^72403^. The number
of atoms in the entire universe is about 10^80^. What is more, cells
have been shown to employ multiple alternative mechanisms to buffer the
effect of gene mutation. So gene mutation rarely results in changed
behaviour at the cellular level, let alone the organism level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Systems Biology shows that complete organisms are required for
their parts to function at all and have any biological purpose. Thus
organisms replicate genes for their own purpose, rather than Genes using
organisms to replicate themselves (as claimed by Dawkins). (See
&amp;quot;Neo-Darwinism, the Modern Synthesis and selfish genes: are they of use
in physiology?&amp;quot; Journal of Physiology. 2011 Mar 1; 589(Pt 5):
1007&amp;ndash;1015.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldfish from Carp DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex language amongst the simplest tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordon Peterson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developments in Geology and Archaeology &amp;ndash; Flood evidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Flew denounced atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flew stated that &amp;quot;the most impressive arguments for God&amp;rsquo;s existence are
those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries&amp;quot; and that
&amp;quot;the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than it was
when I first met it&amp;quot;. The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and
physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply
natural, whichever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of
design by an outside intelligence. Flew supported the idea of an
Aristotelian God with &amp;quot;the characteristics of power and also
intelligence&amp;quot;, stating that the [scientific] evidence for it was
stronger than ever before. (Habermas, Gary R. (9 December 2004), &amp;quot;My
Pilgrimage from Atheism to Theism: An Exclusive Interview with Former
British Atheist Professor Antony Flew&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The only reason which I have for beginning to think of believing in a
First Cause god is the impossibility of providing a naturalistic account
of the origin of the first reproducing organisms.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagining the Kingdom: Mission and Theology in Early Christianity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of St Andrews&lt;br&gt;
St Mary&amp;rsquo;s College (Faculty of Divinity)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inaugural Lecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by the Right Reverend Professor N. T. Wright&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Research Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.15 pm, October 26 2011&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four gospels stand magisterially at the head of the canon and the
centre of early Christianity. They are remarkable documents. If they had
been lost for centuries, and then dug up last year in the sands of
Egypt, they would be hailed as among the most extraordinary writings
from antiquity.  Despite the occasional efforts to push them out of
their central position and substitute other documents, whether actually
existing (such as the wrongly named &lt;em&gt;Gospel of Thomas&lt;/em&gt;) or reconstructed
(such as the hypothetical document &amp;lsquo;Q&amp;rsquo;), the majority of scholars still
believe, rightly in my view, that Matthew, Mark, Luke and John deserve
their place. The fact that they are well known should not blind us to
their remarkable blend of page-turning narrative, vivid portraiture
(especially of their central figure), historical verisimilitude and
sophisticated theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet. Reversing what St Paul says about himself, the gospels, though
well known at one level, are unknown at another. An oversimplification,
of course; but I refer to the overall drift of gospel studies, and to
the perception of the gospels in the church community to which biblical
studies remains tangentially, and sometimes uncomfortably, related. Huge
strides have been made, not least by my predecessor but one, Professor
Richard Bauckham, both in his work on the wide intended readership of
the gospels and in his award-winning book on the gospels and the
eyewitnesses. If he is even half right ­&amp;ndash; and I think he is at least
that &amp;ndash; then all kinds of assumptions, including some of those blessed
things they used to call &amp;lsquo;the assured results of criticism&amp;rsquo;, will need
to be torn up. But we need to go further still. Despite generations now
of redaction criticism and narrative criticism, I am not convinced that
the main message of the gospels has been grasped, let alone reflected in
the methods employed for further study. And since I shall contend in
this lecture that the four gospels stand at the centre of
the &lt;em&gt;missionary&lt;/em&gt; and hence &lt;em&gt;theological&lt;/em&gt; life of the early church, a
failure to understand their central thrust is most likely an index of a
failure to grasp several other things as well about the life and work of
the first Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not being alarmist. Fine work in many directions has been done on
the gospels, a generation ago by another predecessor, Matthew Black of
blessed memory. And of course Robin Wilson, of more recent memory,
contributed much to our understanding of the early Christian hinterland
within which the gospels and their early reception must be understood.
But there comes a time in every discipline to take a deep breath, stand
back, and say, &amp;lsquo;Well and good; but perhaps we&amp;rsquo;re still missing
something.&amp;rsquo; That&amp;rsquo;s when we need, not simply more attention to detail,
vital and central though that remains, but precisely &lt;em&gt;imagination&lt;/em&gt;: a
willingness to think beyond the fence, to ask questions hitherto
screened out. And, to complete the list of recent predecessors, Markus
Bockmuehl in his short stay here published a remarkable
book, &lt;em&gt;Seeing the Word&lt;/em&gt;, offering an eloquent and wide-ranging plea for
just such an imaginative leap, a reassessment of the tasks and methods
of the whole discipline. That is the kind of exercise which I want to
share with you this afternoon, with due gratitude both for the
invitation to occupy this chair and for the warm welcome I have received
in St Mary&amp;rsquo;s College and in the wider University community. (It occurs
to me that within this succession it has been over fifty years since
someone was appointed whose name didn&amp;rsquo;t begin with either a B or a W.
Make of that what you will.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My remarks will fall into three sections. First, I shall propose a fresh
thesis about the gospels, stressing the way in which they summoned their
first readers to imagine a new state of affairs being launched into the
world, a state of affairs for which the obvious shorthand was &amp;lsquo;the
kingdom of God&amp;rsquo;. This might seem obvious, but the history of gospel
scholarship has included many avoidance mechanisms, drawing attention
away from the gospels&#39; uncomfortable claim. Thus, in the second section,
I want to pull back and survey the wider intellectual and cultural
climate in which the discipline of &amp;lsquo;New Testament Studies&amp;rsquo; was born and
nurtured, and suggest that the failure to grasp the central message of
the gospels flows directly from various philosophical and cultural
agendas which have dominated the discipline. This will send us back,
third, to the gospels and the other New Testament writings, to look
afresh at early Christian mission and the theology which grew up to
support and explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. How God Became King: The Story of the Gospels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My proposal about the gospels is that they all, in their rather
different ways, tell the story of Jesus of Nazareth as the story of &lt;em&gt;how
God became king&lt;/em&gt;. They all, in other words, announce the launch of a
&amp;lsquo;theocracy&amp;rsquo;. Research into the gospels has, by and large, managed to
screen out this claim, which would have been obvious in the first
century and which sustained the early church in its life and mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;lsquo;theocracy&amp;rsquo;, of course, sends shivers down many spines today.
In our current climate, with the uneasy stand-off between secularism and
fundamentalism, the idea of &amp;lsquo;theocracy&amp;rsquo; sounds uncomfortably like a
return to what people vaguely imagine as the situation of the Middle
Ages, with popes, bishops and priests ordering everyone about &amp;ndash; or,
indeed, to the forms of theocracy envisaged and sometimes even
implemented in other religions today. (When I was lecturing in Ireland
recently, someone asked me to comment on the fact that only two
countries in the world have clergy sitting as of right in the upper
chamber of Parliament: the UK on the one hand and Iran on the other.)
Most modern westerners, not least in our great universities, react to
this very strongly, upholding freedom both of action and of thought.
Theocracy is what we thought we&amp;rsquo;d got rid of, not something we wanted to
discover in some of the western tradition&amp;rsquo;s most cherished central
texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &amp;lsquo;theocracy&amp;rsquo;, in a sense yet to be defined, is of course what is
meant by &amp;lsquo;the kingdom of God&amp;rsquo;, which the synoptic gospels highlight at
the central motif of Jesus&#39; public announcements and which the fourth
gospel presupposes as his central theme (the first time we meet it in
John it seems to be assumed that this is what Jesus is all about). We
know from Josephus that the revolutionaries, in the last century before
the disastrous Roman-Jewish war, took as their battle-cry the slogan &amp;lsquo;no
king but God!&amp;rsquo; Presumably they thought they knew how God would exercise
that kingly rule. Probably they imagined themselves having some role as
divine agents. But we should not doubt that &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom&amp;rsquo; denoted the
long-awaited rule of Israel&amp;rsquo;s God on earth as in heaven. The widespread
assumption today that &amp;lsquo;the kingdom of God&amp;rsquo; denotes another realm
altogether, for instance that of the &amp;lsquo;heaven&amp;rsquo; to which God&amp;rsquo;s people
might hope to go after their death, was not on the first-century agenda.
When Jesus spoke about God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom, and taught his followers to pray
that it would arrive &amp;lsquo;on earth as in heaven&amp;rsquo;, he was right in the middle
of first-century Jewish theocratic aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the gospels tell the story of Jesus as the story of &amp;lsquo;how God
became king&amp;rsquo;, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just an aspiration; it was an accomplishment.
We can see this in three narratival strands which work together in all
four gospels (though not, interestingly, in any of the non-canonical
gnostic materials). As with this whole lecture, I here summarize and
simplify a large mass of complex material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three strands in question come in addition to, not in competition
with, the two more normally observed. First, the gospels are
biographies: gone are the days when people could confidently deny
that. Several studies have indicated the reverse: when placed alongside
Greco-Roman &lt;em&gt;bioi&lt;/em&gt;, the four canonical gospels clearly belong in
something like the same genre. Second, the gospels reflect the life of
the early church. How precisely they do that is another matter; that
they do so is not in question. But the further three further dimensions
have all too often been missing from the discussion. And these &amp;ndash; which
all interlock &amp;ndash; explain what God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these missing dimensions is that the four canonical gospels
tell the story of Jesus as the &lt;em&gt;continuation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;climax&lt;/em&gt; of the
ancient story of Israel. To say this is more than to say that the
gospels portray Jesus as the fulfilment of ancient prophecy. That is
obvious. It is the &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of fulfilment that matters here. In the wider
Jewish world of the day, some people were telling the longer story of
Israel was being told in search of an ending; the gospels are written in
order to provide such an ending. What matters, though it cuts right
against the grain of modern western thought, is the idea of &lt;em&gt;narrative
continuity&lt;/em&gt;. Not just &amp;lsquo;narrative&amp;rsquo; as such; that might lead simply to a
repeated pattern, which we naturally find as well, for instance in the
strong sense of a &amp;lsquo;new exodus&amp;rsquo;, the fresh and final repetition of
ancient Israel&amp;rsquo;s greatest story. That is important, but it points beyond
itself to the belief that all these repeated patterns were part of a
larger sequence that was going somewhere. History might be in some sense
cyclic, but the cycles contributed to a forward, linear movement. Thus
the book we call Pseudo-Philo tells the ancient story of Israel and
breaks off at the point where David is about to become king. Its
recounting of the tales of the Judges seem to be designed as a model for
militant messianic movements in the writer&amp;rsquo;s own day. The book of Wisdom
recounts the story of the Exodus, not simply as a great historic moment
in Israel&amp;rsquo;s ancient past, but as the model for the new and decisive act
of judgment which Israel&amp;rsquo;s God is about to perform, condemning the
wicked and vindicating his wise and righteous sufferers. At that level,
despite the radical difference of genre, we find something similar in 4
Ezra and 2 Baruch, who look back to the horrible events of 586 BC as a
kind of model for what they have experienced in AD 70, and retell the
ancient story as a way of leading the eye up to the great messianic
deliverance which is about to burst upon the world, with (in 4 Ezra&amp;rsquo;s
vision) the messianic lion triumphing over the pagan eagle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these, in their different ways, look back to the scriptures, and
particularly the book of Daniel, with its intriguing combination of
wisdom and apocalyptic. In fact, the storytelling we have just glanced
at belongs within a much larger movement of thought in which Daniel 9 in
particular became seminal. In Daniel 9 the prophet asks how long the
exile is going to be: will it not, as Jeremiah prophesied, last for
seventy years? Back comes the answer: not seventy years, but seventy
times seven. There are important echoes here of the Jubilee theme from
Leviticus 25, but for our purposes the point is that this predicted 490
years haunted the minds of devout Jews in the centuries immediately
before and after the time of Jesus. There is plenty of evidence to
indicate that people were calculating, as best they could, when that
time would be up, and when the long-awaited deliverance from pagan
domination would therefore occur. Their answers varied wildly. The
Essenes, it appears, pinned their hopes on the climax coming around the
time when Herod the Great died. Some Rabbis, however, did their sums
quite differently (it all depends, of course, where you begin the
sequence), so that when Akiba hailed Simeon benKosiba as Messiah in AD
132 some of his colleagues opposed him, not so much because ben Kosiba
was not a suitable candidate but because, according to their
calculations, the Son of David was not due for at least another century.
All of this, interesting though it is, simply points to the widespread
phenomenon which is, I suggest, the presupposition for the story the
gospels tell in the way they tell it: that Israel&amp;rsquo;s history, under the
guidance of a strange and often opaque divine providence, had not come
to a standstill, but was moving forward towards its appointed goal. The
story has many twists and turns, many flashbacks and indeed
flash-forwards, advance hints of what is to come. But it is a single
storyline, still awaiting its proper and fitting fulfilment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first point, then,  is that all four gospels, in their different
ways, are written so as to say that the story of the public career and
fate of Jesus of Nazareth provides that proper and fitting, if highly
surprising and subversive, fulfilment. Jesus is not, for the
evangelists, simply the antitype of the various types such as Moses, or
David, or the Passover lamb. He is the point at which the millennia-long
narrative has reached its goal. Matthew makes the point, graphically,
with his introductory genealogy. Mark does it with his opening
quotations from Malachi and Isaiah; Luke, by telling the story of John
the Baptist as a reprise of the story of Samuel. (They do it in many
other ways, too, but these stand out.) John goes right back to the
beginning, to the opening of Genesis, and structures his gospel so as to
say that in Jesus not only the story of Israel but the story of all
creation is reaching its decisive goal. And in all four gospels there
are clear echoes and references back, in a variety of ways and contexts,
to the various prophecies of Daniel, including those of chapter 9. It is
in Daniel, of course, that we find the strongest statement of what the
climax will be, when it comes: it will be the arrival of God&amp;rsquo;s own
kingdom, his sovereign rule, trumping the rule of all pagan powers. And
it is to Daniel that we should look to find the text which, according to
Josephus (echoed at this point by Suetonius), most incited Jews to rebel
against Rome: the text according to which a world ruler would, &lt;em&gt;at that
time&lt;/em&gt;, arise from Judaea (&lt;em&gt;Jewish War&lt;/em&gt; 6.312-3;
cf. &lt;em&gt;Antiquities&lt;/em&gt; 10.267, where Josephus singles out Daniel as the only
prophet who gave an exact chronology for when his predictions would come
to pass). Josephus and Suetonius, of course, refer this to Vespasian,
called back from the campaign against Jerusalem to become Emperor in
Rome. The four gospels, clearly, have another candidate in mind. And,
for that matter, a different sort of kingdom. But to that we shall
return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is of course much more that could be said about the way in which
the four gospels tell the story of Jesus as the climax of the continuous
story of Israel, with the kingdom of God arriving at that climax. But I
move rapidly to the second point, which is that the gospels tell this
story as the story of Israel&amp;rsquo;s God. In the world of second-Temple
Judaism there was a strong sense, not just that Israel&amp;rsquo;s fortunes needed
to change, but that Israel&amp;rsquo;s God needed to come back to his people, to
the temple. Ezekiel had described the divine glory leaving Jerusalem,
and had prophesied that it would return to a rebuilt temple, but nobody
ever said they&amp;rsquo;d seen it happen. There is no scene anywhere in the
literature of the period to correspond to Exodus 40, where the divine
glory fills the newly constructed tabernacle, or 1 Kings 8, where the
same thing happens to Solomon&amp;rsquo;s Temple. There is no sudden appearance,
as was granted to the prophet Isaiah. Plenty of texts say that it will
happen (I think, obviously, of Isaiah 40 and 52, the two biblical
passages, interestingly, where the word &amp;lsquo;gospel&amp;rsquo; occurs; of Zechariah
and Malachi), but none indicate that it already has. And here the four
evangelists are quite explicit. John is perhaps the most obvious: &amp;lsquo;the
word became flesh,&amp;rsquo; he says, &amp;lsquo;and tabernacled, pitched his tent, in our
midst; and we beheld his glory.&amp;rsquo; In case we missed the point, John rubs
it in again and again. Mark, outwardly so different to John, hits the
same note with those opening quotations from Isaiah and Malachi. Both
passages concern the return of the divine glory, and the messenger who
will prepare for it. Mark leaves us in no doubt that he thinks it has
now happened, in and through Jesus. Matthew and Luke in their own ways
get at the same point, Matthew not least with the Emmanuel promise and
Luke not least through the terrifying scene in chapter 19 where Jesus,
arriving in Jerusalem, tells the story about the king who comes back at
last, and then announces Jerusalem&amp;rsquo;s imminent destruction because &amp;lsquo;you
did not know the moment when God was visiting you&amp;rsquo; (to;n kairo;n th&#39;~
ejpiskoph&#39;~ sou).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you see that this puts the cat among several older critical
pigeons. I grew up in a scholarly world where it was taken for granted
that while John had a high, most probably Greek, Christology,
thesynoptics had a low, most probably Jewish one. That only shows the
extent to which people were asking the wrong question in the wrong
framework. Once we think first-century Jewishly, a different picture
emerges. To the old sneer, that Jesus talked about God but the early
church talked about Jesus, we may reply that Jesus did indeed talk about
God and God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom &amp;ndash; in order to explain what he himself was doing
and would accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel&amp;rsquo;s stories normally confronted, not other Jews, but the might of
pagan empire. If the gospels bring this story to a climax, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t
surprises us to find &amp;ndash; this is my third main point &amp;ndash; that they are all
written to tell the story of Jesus as the story of Israel, and of
Israel&amp;rsquo;s God, reaching their proper climax, &lt;em&gt;so as thereby to tell the
story of how Israel&amp;rsquo;s God becomes king of the whole world&lt;/em&gt;. This is the
clue to the mission, and the missionary theology, of the early church,
to which I shall return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the other narrative which had exploded around the time that
Jesus was born. The intellectual coup d&amp;rsquo;état which Augustus accomplished
through his court poets and historians was every bit as stunning as the
political coup he achieved in the double civil war that followed the
Julius Caesar&amp;rsquo;s assassination. Everybody in Rome knew that Augustus&amp;rsquo;s
attaining of supreme and unchallengeable power meant the overthrow of a
centuries-long tradition of fierce republicanism (Augustus, of course,
insisted that he had merely restored the republic, but nobody was
fooled). But for Livy to tell the history of Rome through the long years
of the Republic and climaxing with the rule of Augustus, with whom he
had a lasting friendship, was a remarkable achievement. Scholars differ
on the extent to which Livy himself believed that the rule of Augustus
was an unqualified good thing, and Tacitus records (&lt;em&gt;Annals&lt;/em&gt; 4.34) that
in one of the later, and sadly lost, books of his great work Livy felt
able to praise the conspirators Brutus and Cassius. But he knew which
side his bread was buttered on, as is evidenced for instance by his
distorting of key political details to suit the new regime (e.g. 4.20,
where Livy suggests that Cornelius Cossus was consul, not merely a
military tribune, when celebrating his single-handed victory over an
enemy commander four centuries earlier, thus supporting Augustus&amp;rsquo;s
jealous retaining of military glory for himself in his own day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the greatest writer to tell the long story of Rome as a history
leading the eye up to Augustus was Virgil. His early &lt;em&gt;Eclogues&lt;/em&gt; refer to
the turbulent events of the civil war, and include the mysterious
fourth, hailing the birth of a child who will usher in the golden age.
Virgil read the &lt;em&gt;Georgics&lt;/em&gt; to Augustus in person after his victory at
Actium in 31 BC; and he was regularly in the company of Augustus during
the years in which he composed the &lt;em&gt;Aeneid&lt;/em&gt; itself, the greatest poem of
the period. Here there is, as is well known, a strong narrative
teleology&#39; (&lt;em&gt;OCD&lt;/em&gt; 1606), invoking &amp;lsquo;Fate&amp;rsquo; as the force which will lead
Aeneas to found Rome and Rome to produce, eventually, the wonderful new
empire of Augustus. Already in the first Book the scene is set, with
Jupiter himself prophesying to the world, back then in the time of
Aeneas, that from his noble line there will be born &amp;lsquo;a Trojan Caesar,
who shall extend his empire to the ocean, his glory to the stars&amp;rsquo;
(1.286f.). His empire will be lavishly prosperous, and will bring peace
to the world (1.289-95). Aeneas himself is seen as a type of the coming
Augustus, an indication that here, too, typology can flourish within an
overall grand narrative. I am not aware of any monarch before Augustus
causing the story of his own accession to be told as the climax of a
much longer narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these three points are grasped together, we observe a remarkable
phenomenon. There is no sign that the Romans are borrowing from Jewish
tradition the idea of a thousand-year history climaxing in a surprising
but victorious, prosperous and peace-bringing reign. Nor is there any
suggestion that Matthew, Mark, Luke or John had read Livy or Virgil. But
their story of Jesus as bringing the long history of Israel to an
unexpected climax offered a remarkable parallel to the great Roman
narrative, which Augustus and his successors were busily reinforcing in
statues, coins and other symbolic artefacts. It was bound to be set on a
collision course. The Jews, too, had cherished a prophecy about a coming
king whose peaceful rule would extend from one sea to the other, from
the River to the ends of the earth (Psalm 89; Zechariah 9). And the four
evangelists declare that this king has arrived, and that his name is
Jesus. It is not surprising &amp;ndash; to anticipate a later point &amp;ndash; that we
find the early church accused, in northern Greece which was such key
terrain for the early Empire, of behaving contrary to the dogmas of
Caesar, and saying that there was &amp;lsquo;another king [&lt;em&gt;basilea heteron&lt;/em&gt;],
namely Jesus&amp;rsquo; (Acts 17.7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome is, of course, scarcely mentioned in the four gospels. Yet, for
those with first-century ears attuned, its presence is everywhere
presupposed. John&amp;rsquo;s great climactic scene of Jesus and Pilate &amp;ndash; the
kingdom of God against the kingdom of Caesar, challenging one another&amp;rsquo;s
visions of kingdom, truth and power &amp;ndash; shows where, for him, the story
was heading all along. Luke stages the birth of Jesus carefully in
relation to the decree of Caesar Augustus, and his second volume ends
with Paul in Rome announcing God as king and Jesus as lord, &amp;lsquo;openly and
unhindered&amp;rsquo;. Matthew and Mark draw heavily on Daniel 7, the passage
above all where God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom confronts and overthrows the kingdoms of
the world, seen as a succession of four increasingly horrible monsters.
There is no doubt, in the first century, that the fourth monster would
have meant Rome. And if recent suggestions are right, Mark himself may
have deliberately framed his gospel with strong hints that in Jesus an
empire was coming to birth of a completely different character to that
of Caesar. A current article (&lt;em&gt;NTS&lt;/em&gt; 2010) contrasts the dove which
descended on Jesus at his baptism with the Roman eagle, appearing as an
omen to further the cause of Augustus or his successors. And an
increasingly common interpretation of Jesus&#39; triumphal entry into
Jerusalem is to see that event not only as the staged fulfilment of
Zechariah 9 but also as a deliberate parody of the regular entry into
Jerusalem of Pontius Pilate, on horseback surrounded by soldiers, coming
from his quarters in Caesarea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not that is correct, we should certainly see the muttered
remark of the centurion at the foot of the cross as vital. Mark hopes
that his Roman readers will come to share this astonishing viewpoint. In
a world where Caesar, unambiguously, was hailed as &amp;lsquo;son of God&amp;rsquo;, the
centurion looks at the dead Jesus and transfers the title to him. It is
the point where all the lines meet &amp;ndash; the lines that run from Abraham,
David and the exile; the lines that run from 2 Samuel 7, Psalm 2 and
Psalm 72; the lines that run from Exodus 40 to 1 Kings 8 and Ezekiel 43;
and, above all, from Isaiah 40&amp;mdash;55 all the way into the mindset of
Jesus himself and the interpretative work of the evangelists. The story
told by all four gospels is the story of How God Became King: not by the
usual means of military revolution, but by the inauguration of
sovereignty during Jesus&#39; public career, and the strange but decisive
victory on the cross itself. All four report that Jesus was executed
with the words &amp;lsquo;king of the Jews&amp;rsquo; over his head; and, as they all knew
though many scholars have long forgotten, the ancient Jewish dream was
that the king of the Jews would be king of the world. Of course: if
Israel&amp;rsquo;s God was the creator of the world, one would expect nothing
less. And what the four evangelists are asking their readers to do, as
they ponder this strange multi-layered narrative, is precisely
to &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt;: to imagine that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, rather than something else, is
what it would look like when God became king. Along with music and the
visual arts, narrative is a primary human means of stimulating the
imagination. And this is precisely, I suggest, what the four gospels are
aiming to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the themes which I see prominently in the gospels but not so
prominently in contemporary scholarship. Indeed, much of the effort
expended on the gospels over the last hundred years and more has been
directed, not towards grappling with these issues, but precisely towards
holding them at bay. Narrative and imagination have been at a discount;
the mechanical study of dismembered fragments has been the rule. Most of
the much-vaunted &amp;lsquo;methods&amp;rsquo; proposed in gospel scholarship have been
generated from within a world where all that I have just said has been
ignored. Such methods are not neutral; they reflect the underlying
assumptions of their makers, and I am suggesting that those underlying
assumptions were deeply flawed. But why should this have been so? To try
to understand that I turn to the second main section of my lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Avoiding the Kingdom: The Story of Biblical Scholarship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are to engage with our predecessors as historical critics of the
New Testament we must contextualize them in the climate of thought in
which they lived. An obvious example, not least in connection with
dismembered fragments, is the great German Rudolf Bultmann. He was
himself keenly aware of his own presuppositions, though many of his
followers, not least in the UK and America, treated his work as the
objective results of neutral scholarship. Anything but: he was writing
his major work on the gospels at a time when, after the First World War
and the demise of the Kaiser and other &amp;lsquo;great men&amp;rsquo;, Germany was trying
to become simply a &amp;lsquo;community&amp;rsquo;, a &lt;em&gt;Gemeinde&lt;/em&gt;, in the Weimar Republic.
What did Bultmann do? He wrote about the gospels as the collections of
stories which &lt;em&gt;die Gemeinde&lt;/em&gt;, the &amp;lsquo;community&amp;rsquo;, told amongst themselves
to sustain their present faith, not at all intending reference to a
recently departed &amp;lsquo;great man&amp;rsquo;, except for the sheer fact of his
crucifixion. No thought of &amp;lsquo;kingdom&amp;rsquo; there in any sense that a
first-century Jew might recognise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that observation is simply the tip of the iceberg. So, too, is the
necessary warning issued a generation ago by Hans Frei, that for much of
the last two centuries narrative itself has been &amp;lsquo;eclipsed&amp;rsquo; in biblical
scholarship, which had regarded stories as secondary and looked instead
for nuggets of doctrinal and ethical teaching. (We might compare the
recent anti-Bible put out by the philosopher A. C. Grayling, which
despite its attempt to parody the actual Bible, with its
chapter-headings and its &amp;lsquo;verses&amp;rsquo;, consists of no narrative at all, but
only wise sayings and advice.) But, again, one has to ask why. This is a
question which demands a multi-volume answer. All I can do here is to
put two or three items on the table for further discussion. I shall once
again oversimplify. My aim is to stimulate the disciplined imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, ever since the Renaissance the implicit narrative of western
culture has included a fracture. There is the good early period; then
there is the bad or boring middle period; then there is the sudden
reawakening, the shining of a great light, in which we retrieve the good
early period &amp;ndash; or some of it, anyway &amp;ndash; in a newly formed culture or
worldview. Thus the Renaissance itself, fed up with what was seen as the
stodgy and unimaginative categories of the late Middle Ages, saw itself
as breaking with the immediate past and retrieving an earlier golden
age. The Reformation, in its turn, went back not (of course) to the
Renaissance&amp;rsquo;s pagan sources but to the Bible and the early fathers,
though largely agreeing about the dark middle period from which one
needed a clean break. The Enlightenment, some of whose seeds were sown
in both the Renaissance and the Reformation, constantly tends to portray
everything before it as ignorant superstition, hailing modern science
and technology as the signs of the brave new world which enable us to
draw an even thicker line between ourselves and our predecessors,
retrieving only those bits and pieces of earlier wisdom which may
commend themselves from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way or another, though, all these great movements have contained an
implicit (and often explicit) narrative in which what one precisely does
not want is continuity. Within Protestantism in particular &amp;ndash; and until
fairly recently most of the running in biblical scholarship was made by
Protestants of one stripe or another &amp;ndash; the sense of a major break in
the narrative is deeply important. Anything else might signal, at least
by implication, that the Catholics had been right all along, even though
ostensibly the story being told would have been about the first century
rather than the sixteenth. There has, then, been deep visceral
resistance to any idea of a continuous narrative, and this itself has
greatly impeded a recognition of what the gospels were actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, however, the movement of thought from the Renaissance to the
Enlightenment can be characterized especially by the major revival of
Epicureanism. Ever since Poggio Bracciolini rediscovered Lucretius&amp;rsquo;s
great poem &lt;em&gt;De Rerum Natura&lt;/em&gt; in an obscure European monastery in 1417 &amp;ndash;
exactly a century before Luther&amp;rsquo;s supposed rediscovery of Paul&amp;rsquo;s
theology led him to nail his thesis to the Wittenberg door &amp;ndash; the great
alternative philosophy of the first century (alternative, that is, to
the otherwise dominant Stoicism) had been making its way in European
circles (see now Stephen Greenblatt, &lt;em&gt;The Swerve: How the Renaissance
Began&lt;/em&gt; [London: The Bodley Head, 2011]). It came to its full flowering
with the thinkers of the Enlightenment, taking in such seminal figures
as Giordani Bruno, Montaigne, Galileo, Bacon, Hobbes, Newton, Hume and,
not least, Thomas Jefferson, who famously proclaimed &amp;lsquo;I am an
Epicurean&amp;rsquo;. (That claim has to be taken seriously, despite Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s
attempts to have his cake and eat it by also noting his admiration for
Epictetus, a first-century Stoic, and of course for Jesus himself; the
latter two being subject to Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s own rather heavy-handed attempts
to decontextualize them and present the cleaned-up results in a way that
sustained his other agendas rather than undermining them, as left to
themselves they might have done.) The point is that in Epicurean
philosophy, over against the confused and frightening paganism of the
ancient world and the confused and frightening religion of the middle
ages, the gods are removed far away, off to a distant heaven from which
they don&amp;rsquo;t even bother to get involved in the affairs of the present
world. The world itself, according to the first-century atomism of
Lucretius, consists of, well, atoms, and the objects made up of them,
moving under their own steam, without divine intervention, developing
and transforming themselves according to their own energy, their innate
&amp;lsquo;swerve&amp;rsquo; (&lt;em&gt;clinamen&lt;/em&gt;, a crucial Epicurean term), and the survival of the
fittest.Darwinism before Darwin. Human society, likewise, should be able
to order itself from within, needing no divine intervention whether
through kings or priests or anybody else. The modern movement of liberal
democracy is thus the twin sister of modern atheistic science, sharing
Lucretius as the primary ancestor and the Enlightenment philosophers as
immediate parents. Biblical scholarship as we know it today was born in
a world where the gods had been banished far away, a world in which
humans and their societies moved under their own steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of westerners today simply do not realise either that they
are Epicureans by default or that Epicureanism was always only one
philosophy among others. As a young theologian I was taught that the
Enlightenment had opened up a new &lt;em&gt;saeculum&lt;/em&gt; (as indeed the American
dollar bill declares to this day), and that we could not think of
challenging it. That, of course, was the shrill protest that presaged
the arrival of postmodernity, when the old Enlightenment certainties
were shaken to the core. But people usually do not realise that the
Epicurean stance of separating God or the gods from the world was always
simply one option; that it was always an unstable option (since the gods
always tended to sneak back in by other means, as in the Romantic
movement&amp;rsquo;s pantheistic answer to Enlightenment rationalism), that it was
always a costly option, easier to embrace if you were rich and healthy
enough to enjoy the Epicurean lifestyle. But the most important point is
that this unstable and costly option was always going to be a very bad
framework for understanding the Jewish traditions, especially the New
Testament itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course, as a historian I believe that people with all kinds of
different worldviews can and should study the evidence of the past and
offer what interpretations they can of it, and particularly &amp;ndash; the heart
of good history &amp;ndash; what made people tick. As the great contemporary
historian Asa Briggs has written in his recent account of his time at
Bletchley Park, what made young historians such goodcodebreakers is that
they were &amp;lsquo;well read, drawn to lateral thinking, and taught to get
inside the mind of people totally different from themselves&amp;rsquo; (&lt;em&gt;Secret
Days&lt;/em&gt; p 78). But there&amp;rsquo;s the point. To use the anthropologist&amp;rsquo;s jargon,
historians of whatever background and context ought to have a stab at
offering an &lt;em&gt;etic&lt;/em&gt; account of the societies they are studying, that is,
an outsider&amp;rsquo;s fair analysis of the phenomena before them. But, as with
anthropology, so with history, the insidious pressure is there to
provide what purports to be an &lt;em&gt;emic&lt;/em&gt; account &amp;ndash; an account of how the
people themselves actually thought &amp;ndash; but which is in fact
the &lt;em&gt;etic&lt;/em&gt; one in disguise. And when, in the case of Enlightenment
historiography, the &lt;em&gt;etic&lt;/em&gt; account was offered from within Epicurean
principles, the chance of getting anywhere near the &lt;em&gt;emic&lt;/em&gt;account that
first-century Jews (including the early Christians) might have offered
was severely reduced. In fact, within the Epicurean worldview Judaism
was reduced, first, to being a &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; (the word &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; itself
having been already severely redefined to reflect Epicurean principles,
now meaning &amp;lsquo;that which humans do with their solitude&amp;rsquo;), and then to
being &lt;em&gt;the wrong sort&lt;/em&gt; of religion (since it persisted, perversely from
the Epicurean point of view, in believing that the real world of
creation, and human actions within it, actually mattered as part of the
whole). Those who embraced the Enlightenment but sought still to be good
Christians thus portrayed themselves in a different light. Martin
Luther&amp;rsquo;s Protestantism, in which Paul rose and smote the wicked
Judaizers, came to birth in a new form, as Christianity had to become
unJewish in order to hold up its head in European culture. I&amp;rsquo;m talking
here about the 1830s, not yet the 1930s. Religion and ordinary life had
to be kept as far apart as possible. The French went all the way with
the Enlightenment agenda, and tried to wipe out religion entirely &amp;ndash; as
they are still trying to do, with the banning of Muslim headscarves. The
Americans compromised, and insisted on a rigid separation of church and
state: you could still be a Christian, but you&amp;rsquo;d better not bring it
into public life. The English, as usual, looked this way and that, took
a pragmatic approach, and muddled along. As a newcomer, I had better not
try to describe what happened in Scotland, though the simultaneous
influence of John Knox and David Hume offers an interesting legacy. As
for Ireland, I am reminded of the remark of my good friend the Irish
American biblical scholar Dominic Crossan, who said that the Irish never
really got the Enlightenment, but they got the British instead, which
they found most enlightening in other ways. But my point is this:
Epicureanism, and its social and political outworkings, may or may not
be the best way for us today to organise our world. I would argue not,
but that&amp;rsquo;s not the point. But it is certainly not a good framework for
us to understand the world of the early Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discipline has reflected this, on both sides of various great
debates. The fateful Enlightenment split between the gods and the world
has generated a new meaning for words like &amp;lsquo;natural&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;supernatural&amp;rsquo;.
It is now widely believed by would-be Christian apologists that part of
the task is to defend something called &amp;lsquo;the supernatural&amp;rsquo;, in which a
normally distant divinity invades the &amp;lsquo;natural&amp;rsquo; world to perform
&amp;lsquo;miracles&amp;rsquo; or even, in the Christian story, to become human. But this
merely reinscribes and perpetuates the Epicureanism which still serves
as the framework for the discussion. Thus, in the study of the gospels,
so-called &amp;lsquo;liberals&amp;rsquo; have done their best to offer would-be historical
accounts in which Jesus was &amp;lsquo;really&amp;rsquo; a Jewish revolutionary or teacher
or apocalyptic prophet (the notion of &amp;lsquo;apocalyptic&amp;rsquo; itself, by the way,
has suffered radically through this process, but that&amp;rsquo;s another story),
while the so-called &amp;lsquo;conservatives&amp;rsquo; have done their best to offer a
historical account in which Jesus really was a &amp;lsquo;supernatural&amp;rsquo; being who
really did do miracles and rise from the dead. And since in my own work
I have done my best to counter some of the revisionist proposals it
might be easy to suppose I was simply taking the latter path. Rather, I
want to insist that to understand the first Christians we must
understand the radical difference between the ancient Jewish worldview
and the ancient Epicurean worldview (remembering not least that one of
the sharpest insults a Rabbi could offer to heretics was to call
them &lt;em&gt;apikorsim&lt;/em&gt;, Epicureans). In the ancient Jewish worldview, the one
God was not removed from the world, but was mysteriously present and
active within it, at least in theory, so that if he remained absent, as
in the second-Temple period, there was precisely a sense of that
absence. And the modes of his presence and activity were concentrated on
the major Jewish symbols: Temple, Torah, land, family, and not least the
great narrative which was continuing and would be fulfilled even though
it might have seemed for the moment, like a submerged stream, to be
running underground. This was the air Jesus and his first followers
breathed. And the task of describing, from an &lt;em&gt;emic&lt;/em&gt; viewpoint, the
mindset and motivation of the earliest Christians is thus one for which
the Epicurean worldview is singularly badly suited. And to the extent
that the movement of nineteenth-century biblical scholarship was done
from within that Enlightenment framework, in its various forms owing
much to Kant, Hegel and later Feuerbach, it was bound to misunderstand
and misrepresent what the earliest Christians were about. And since some
of the nineteenth-century proposals are still alive and well, kept alive
by the sheer inertia of a complex discipline long after their sell-by
date, we still find ourselves facing categories like &amp;lsquo;Jewish Christian&amp;rsquo;
and &amp;lsquo;Gentile Christian&amp;rsquo;, like &amp;lsquo;Early Catholicism&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;apocalyptic&amp;rsquo;,
which actually demand such radical overhaul that it might be better to
draw our own heavy line across the false&lt;em&gt;Heilsgeschichte&lt;/em&gt; of
triumphalist scholarship, and try to start again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another element to all this which I just mention before turning
to my final point about the cultural context of modern biblical
scholarship. Much of this work has been done within the Lutheran
tradition. But, for all its strengths, the Lutheran world has long
embraced a &amp;lsquo;two kingdoms&amp;rsquo; theology in which God and Caesar simply won&amp;rsquo;t
mix. When coupled with the Enlightenment&amp;rsquo;s Epicureanism, this has
produced several generations of scholarship in which, for instance, it
is off limits to imagine that Paul might have regarded Jesus as the
Messiah, with all the overtones of world sovereignty that word carried.
The general scholarly view has colluded with the general popular view of
western Christianity, that the purpose of the whole thing is to go to
heaven when you die rather than discerning, &amp;lsquo;imagining&amp;rsquo; shall we say,
the kingdom of God on earth as in heaven and working for that end. Of
course, liberation theology and its various exegetical offshoots have
offered a rival view. But, as with the so-called &amp;lsquo;conservative&amp;rsquo;
reaction, this has often simply maintained the split world of the
Enlightenment, proposing (for instance) that Paul was &amp;lsquo;really&amp;rsquo; a
politician &lt;em&gt;and therefore not really a theologian after all&lt;/em&gt;. Similar
things might be said about some of the work, important in its own way,
that has gone under the umbrella of &amp;lsquo;sociology&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;anthropology&amp;rsquo;. From
the post-Enlightenment standpoint, this appears to be on the &amp;lsquo;worldly&amp;rsquo;
side of the divide while God, or the gods, remain elsewhere. From the
Jewish and early Christian perspective, such a division already gives in
to one version of the paganism which both were determined to resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final element of our modern world which has militated against
imagining the kingdom in our reading of the gospels, and much else
besides, is the triumph of left-brain thinking over right-brain
thinking. This has been massively and memorably set out by Iain
McGilchrist in his breathtaking book &lt;em&gt;The Master and his Emissary&lt;/em&gt;.
McGilchrist has of course inevitably been criticized from within his own
field; he is both a brain scientist and a literary critic, and as such
has a unique perspective on the history of ideas, though some of his
fellow scientists insist that the left/right distinction is not nearly
so hard and fast as his book (despite frequent disclaimers and
modifications) might indicate. But, whatever caveats may be needed at
the level of the study of the physical brain, as I read his account of
the way in which, in the last three centuries, the apparently left-brain
activities of analysing, calculating and organising have steadily taken
charge of our world, squeezing out the apparently right-brain activities
of imagination, story-telling, and intuitive thinking, I find it
uncannily accurate as a description of our world in general and of
biblical scholarship in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGilchrist argues on the basis of brain science itself, in fact, that
our brains are designed to work in a two-way movement: from the right
brain, with its initial intuitions, metaphors and imagination, to the
left brain which works on the detail, and back to the right brain again
to engage with the real world. The right brain is thus the &amp;lsquo;master&amp;rsquo;, and
the left brain the &amp;lsquo;emissary&amp;rsquo;, working at its best within the framework
given by the right and intending to pass the results back across. But,
as with some observable pathologies (not least schizophrenia), the left
brain has taken over, and we live (says McGilchrist) in a world in which
the master has been betrayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGilchrist does not refer to the world of biblical scholarship, but the
following paragraph jumped out at me as a pretty accurate summary of how
the discipline has often gone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;We could expect&amp;rsquo; (he writes) &amp;lsquo;that there would be a loss of the
broader picture, and a substitution of a more narrowly focussed,
restricted, but detailed, view of the world, making it perhaps difficult
to maintain a coherent overview . . . This in turn would promote the
substitution of information, and information gathering, for knowledge,
which comes through experience . . . One would expect the left
hemisphere to keep doing refining experiments on detail, at which it is
exceedingly proficient, but to be correspondingly blind to what is not
clear or certain, or cannot be brought into focus right in the middle of
the visual field. In fact one would expect a sort of dismissive attitude
to anything outside of its limited focus, because the right hemisphere&amp;rsquo;s
take on the whole picture would simply not be available to it.&amp;rsquo; (428f.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognise this picture. Having worked for the Church of England for
nearly twenty years, I recognise it as an account of what has happened,
damagingly, to our institutions. Whether it has happened in the
universities too, in the years I have been absent, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly
say. My point is that it has manifestly happened in biblical studies,
and especially in New Testament studies, and not least in the study of
the gospels. All too often the microscopic analysis of details, vital
though it is in its place, has been made to seem an end in itself.
&amp;lsquo;Objective facts&amp;rsquo; are all the rage, and whether you&amp;rsquo;re a left-wing
hunter of objectivity, determined to disprove the gospels, or a
right-wing hunter of objectivity, determined to show that they are after
all &amp;lsquo;factual&amp;rsquo;, you may still be missing the point and losing the plot.
Facts are left-brain business; vital in their place, but only part of
the whole. Thus, on the one hand, those who presently trumpet the need
for a purely and exclusively &amp;lsquo;secular&amp;rsquo; study of the Bible are simply
following through the anti-metaphorical agenda of the French Revolution
(McGilchrist 347); while those who respond with an attempted
rationalistic proof of, say, Jesus&#39; divinity are often themselves
remaining within the same sterile antithesis. Like Marxism and
capitalism, secularism and fundamentalism are simply the left and right
boots of Enlightenment Epicureanism. Only when the detailed left-brain
analysis can be relocated as the emissary to the right-wing intuition,
with its rich world of metaphor, narrative and above all imagination,
can the discipline become healthy again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the gospels themselves resist the destructive,
atomising, Epicurean left-brain analysis. They go on telling the story
of How God Became King, and demanding that serious readers learn to
imagine a world in which that might be the case, a world reshaped around
their account of Jesus. Perhaps, after all, biblical studies might be
one place where the return of the Master, a theme indeed made famous by
some of Jesus&#39; own stories, might begin to take place. This is a
challenge, particularly, for those engaged in doctoral studies. It is
much easier to do a purely left-brain doctorate, and there is still
plenty of room for that. But we also need, and quite urgently, a new
generation who won&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to see the bigger picture and, without in
the least going slack on the necessary left-brain analytic and
philological exactitude, come back and articulate a new, freshly
imagined vision of the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Early Christian Mission and Theology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this leads to my concluding remarks on early Christian mission and
theology. For over a century now it has been commonplace within the
discipline called New Testament Studies to assume that the early church
had to jettison its Jewishness in order to be relevant to the Gentile
world into which it quickly went. Thus it has been assumed, again, that
Paul had to downplay the idea of Jesus as Israel&amp;rsquo;s Messiah and to
switch, instead, to the more readily available category of the kuvrio~,
the &amp;lsquo;Lord&amp;rsquo;. But this proposal, hugely influential though it has been,
simply fails to imagine what &amp;lsquo;the kingdom of God&amp;rsquo; meant to the early
Christians, Paul included (he doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the phrase that often, but
when he does we can see that it remains at the centre of his worldview).
Paul, in fact, held firmly to the ancient Jewish belief, rooted in the
Psalms, in Isaiah and in Daniel, that a world ruler would indeed arise
from Judaea, that Israel&amp;rsquo;s God would thereby return to dwell amongst and
within his people, and that through this means the long-awaited new
creation of peace and justice would be inaugurated for the whole world.
All of that standard Jewish expectation came to fresh flowering in
Paul&amp;rsquo;s work. Of course, the communities which Paul founded were
determinedly non-ethnic in their basis. But this was not because Paul
had as it were gone soft on the essential Jewishness of his mission, or
because there was something wrong (as Epicureans imagine) with Judaism,
but because he believed that it was precisely part of the age-old divine
plan that when God did for Israel what he was going to do for Israel
then the nations would be brought under the healing, saving rule of this
one God. Paul&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;gospel&amp;rsquo;, his eujaggevlion, was thus much closer in
meaning to the various eujaggevlia of Caesar than most of modern
scholarship has imagined. It was, as Acts 17 (already quoted) indicates,
the royal announcement, right under Caesar&amp;rsquo;s nose, that there was
&amp;lsquo;another king, namely Jesus&amp;rsquo;. And Paul believed that this royal
announcement, like that of Caesar, was not a take-it-or-leave-it affair.
It was a powerful summons through which the living God worked by his
Spirit in hearts and minds, to transform human character and motivation,
producing the tell-tale signs of faith, hope and love which Paul
regarded as the biblically prophesied marks of God&amp;rsquo;s true people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communities which sprang into surprised existence as Paul went
around making this royal announcement were remarkably devoid of an
obvious symbolic world. They were precisely not defined by the
worldview-symbols of Judaism &amp;ndash; Temple, Torah observance and so on. They
certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t adopt the symbols of the surrounding pagan culture. How
could this new community, this new &lt;em&gt;sort&lt;/em&gt; of community, retain what for
Paul was its vital centre, namely its strong unity across traditional
social divisions, and its strong holiness in matters of our old friends,
money, sex and power? For Paul the answer was simple. The community
needed to understand what it was that had happened in Jesus the Messiah,
and in particular who the God was into whose new world they had been
brought. What we see in Paul is thus properly characterized as the birth
of the discipline which later came to be called Christian theology, by
which I mean the prayerful and scripture-based reflection, from within
the common life of the otherwise disparate body called the church, on
who exactly the one God was and what his action in Jesus and by the
Spirit was to mean. Early Christian theology was not an exercise
undertaken for the sake of speculative system-building. It was
load-bearing. If the unity and holiness of the early church were the
central symbols of the movement, they could only be held in place if a
vigorous theology was there to stabilize them in the winds and storms of
the first century. Theology, in this sense, serves ecclesiology and thus
the kingdom-based mission. Actually, I have come to worry about a
post-Enlightenment theology that doesn&amp;rsquo;t do this, that thinks the point
is simply to &amp;lsquo;prove&amp;rsquo; the divinity of Jesus, or his resurrection, or the
saving nature of his death in themselves, thereby demonstrating fidelity
to the Creeds or some other &lt;em&gt;regula fidei&lt;/em&gt;. In the gospels themselves it
isn&amp;rsquo;t like this. All these things matter, but they matter because this
is how God is becoming king. To prove the great Creeds true, and to
affirm them as such, can sadly be a diversionary exercise, designed to
avoid the real challenge of the first-century gospel, the challenge of
God&amp;rsquo;s becoming king in and through Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge, of course, required imagination: not the undisciplined
fantasy of which left-brain thinking often accuses right-brain thinking,
but the imaginative leap from the worldviews of paganism, with their
many gods who might either be far removed, as in Epicureanism, or rolled
into one and close at hand, as in Stoicism &amp;ndash; or indeed from the
worldviews of ancient Judaism, with their fierce concentration on the
symbols of land, nation, temple and Torah. But the leap was not made
into the unknown. The imaginative leap required was made on the basis of
Jesus, Jesus the crucified and risen Jewish Messiah, Jesus the one in
and through whom Israel&amp;rsquo;s God had at last returned in person to rescue
his people and the world. And to sustain precisely that leap, the early
Christians told and retold, and eventually wrote down, the story of
Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four gospels, then, to return to our starting point, are thus
appropriately named &amp;lsquo;gospel&amp;rsquo;, in line both with Isaiah 40 and 52 and
with the contemporary pagan usage. They themselves, in telling the story
of how God became king in and through Jesus, invite their readers to the
imaginative leap of saying, &amp;lsquo;Suppose this is how God has done it?
Suppose the world&amp;rsquo;s way of empire is all wrong? Suppose there&amp;rsquo;s a
different way, and suppose that Jesus, in his life, death and
resurrection, has brought it about?&amp;rsquo; And the gospels themselves, of
course, contain stories at a second level, stories purportedly told by
Jesus himself, which were themselves, in their day, designed to break
open the worldview of their hearers and to initiate a massive
imaginative leap to which Jesus gave the name &amp;lsquo;faith&amp;rsquo;. The gospels
invite their readers, in other words, to a multiple exercise, both of
imagining what it might have been like to make that leap in the first
century (both for Jesus&#39; hearers and then, at a second stage, for their
own readers) and, as a further stage again, of imagining what it might
be like to do so today. For too long gospel study has been dominated by
the attempt to make the gospels reflect, simply, the faith-world of the
early church. Why, after all, the radical critics used to say, would the
early Christians have been particularly interested in miscellaneous
stories of what Jesus actually said or did, when all that really
mattered was his saving death, making the gospels simply &amp;lsquo;passion
narratives with extended introductions&amp;rsquo;? The conservative response has
been that early converts would naturally want to know more about this
Jesus in whom they had come to place their faith. But this stand-off, on
both sides, has usually failed to reflect the larger question: that the
gospels tell the story of Jesus not out of mere historical anecdotage or
faith-projection, but because this is how Jesus launched the kingdom of
God, which he then accomplished in his death and resurrection. Even to
hold this possibility in one&amp;rsquo;s head requires, in today&amp;rsquo;s western church,
whether radical or conservative, no less than in the non-Christian
world, a huge effort of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This imagination, like all good right-brain activity, must then be
firmly and thoroughly worked through the left brain, disciplined by the
rigorous historical and textual analysis for which the discipline of
biblical studies has rightly become famous. But, by itself, the left
brain will produce, and has often produced, a discipline full of facts
but without meaning, high on analysis and low on reconstruction, good at
categories and weak on the kingdom. One of the reasons I was excited to
be invited to come to St Andrews is because this is already one of the
very few places in the world where the imagination is taken seriously as
part of the whole theological discipline. I hope and trust and pray that
we will be able to work together at the challenging but richly rewarding
tasks of imagining the kingdom in such a way that will simultaneously
advance the academic understanding of our extraordinary primary texts
and enrich the mission and theology of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s church. It is just as
difficult today as it was in the first century to imagine what the
kingdom of God might look like. Rigorous historical study of the gospels
and the other early Christian writings has a proper role to play in
fuelling, sustaining and directing that imagination, and in helping to
translate it into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Christ</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/salvation/in-christ/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/salvation/in-christ/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;in-christ&#34;&gt;In Christ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NT makes it abundantly clear that no matter how much we believe in
Jesus&#39; saving work on the cross, no matter how grateful we are, no
matter how much we celebrate it in song and in sharing the bread and
wine; all this is useless unless we are &lt;em&gt;in Christ&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh
of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. (John
6:53) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are &lt;em&gt;in Christ
Jesus&lt;/em&gt; (Rom 8:1) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;the glorious riches of this Gospel is &lt;em&gt;Christ in you&lt;/em&gt;, the hope of
glory.&amp;quot; (Col 1:27) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... to be found &lt;em&gt;in him&lt;/em&gt;, not having a righteousness of my own ...
but that which is through faith in Christ (Phil 3:9) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that Jesus &lt;em&gt;Himself&lt;/em&gt; is our righteousness and our
salvation. Forgiveness and salvation was not something Jesus bought for
us which we then go and pick up, or &amp;quot;sign-up&amp;quot; for. It was not merely
some legal deal done with God. We do not simply need to &amp;quot;appropriate&amp;quot;
(take something for one&#39;s own use) salvation; Jesus is
not &lt;em&gt;Santa&lt;/em&gt; Christ, leaving gifts for us to discover in His absence! No,
we need to eat and drink Jesus, we need to become one with Him, He in us
and we in Him.  Our salvation consists of sharing in Jesus&#39;
relationship to the Father: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God raised us up &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; Christ and seated us &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; him in the
heavenly realms &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; Christ Jesus (Eph 2:6) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is because of him that you are &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; Christ Jesus, &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; has become
... our righteousness, holiness and redemption. (1 Cor 1:30) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our righteousness consists in &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; Christ, not
just &lt;em&gt;believing&lt;/em&gt; in Him. Indeed, Jesus Himself pioneered that union: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. (John 1:14) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I and the Father are one.&amp;rdquo; (John 10:30) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, being a true flesh-and-blood man yet living in union with the
Father, pioneered the way for us to live in our flesh-and-blood and yet
be in union with Him, sharing His union with the Father: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship (literally:
communion) with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. (1 Cor 1:9) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in our communion and co-union with Jesus that we find our
salvation and righteousness: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When
Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him
in glory. (Col 3:3-4) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus spoke of going away and sending the Spirit, but despite the fact
that he said &amp;ldquo;*&lt;strong&gt;[I]{.ul}&lt;/strong&gt; *will come to you (Jn 14:18) we tend to
think that the Holy Spirit is the sole means by which we are united with
God. But this is not the teaching of the NT. Rather it is through the
Holy Spirit that &lt;em&gt;Christ&lt;/em&gt; dwells in us, and we in Him. Thus the Holy
Spirit is sometimes called the Spirit of Christ.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our
hearts, the Spirit who calls out, &amp;ldquo;Abba, Father.&amp;quot; (Galatians 4:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not the body of the Spirit but the body of Christ. The Spirit&#39;s
purpose is to reveal and make real to us our union with Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this union is not just a union of purpose and belief, but deeply
personal and all-embracing is demonstrated by the language Paul uses in
describing it. In Eph 5:29-32 he likens it to marriage where two become
one flesh. Then in 1Cor 6:15-17 he makes the explicit comparison with
sexual union. The point being that bodily union with a prostitute
violates our union with Christ precisely because our union with Christ
includes our bodies and makes our bodies the temple of the Holy Spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we often talk about being saved by faith, it is not
really &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; that saves, but Christ who saves us, and it is by faith
that we become one with Him and are thereby saved: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;strong&gt;Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith&lt;/strong&gt;. And I pray
that you &amp;hellip; may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
(Eph 3:17-19) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union with Christ is not a pursuit, achieved through emulating Christ&#39;s
holy life. It is not the reward and end of sanctification. Rather, it is
the starting point and motivation for sanctification: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ and the believer have the same life. They are not separate
persons linked together by some temporary bond of friendship&amp;mdash;they are
united by a tie as close and indissoluble as if the same blood ran in
their veins. (Strong, Systematic Theology, 802) &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>John Piper on suffering</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/healing/john-piper-on-suffering/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/healing/john-piper-on-suffering/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;john-piper-on-suffering&#34;&gt;John Piper on suffering&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfStzaznIzk&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfStzaznIzk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsunami swept whole churches to their death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark 4:41 Even the wind and the waves obey him!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore Jesus had wise and good reasons not to prevent that disaster,
and not to restrain the Carona Virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But does this mean He is orchestrating all these disasters &amp;ndash; John Piper
concludes Jesus has an active purpose for all disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God subjected all creation, including believers, to decay at the
fall Romans 8:18-25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christians this is not an experience of condemnation, but
purification.&lt;br&gt;
1 Cor 11:29-32 &amp;quot;For those who eat and drink without discerning the
body of Christ eat and drink &lt;strong&gt;judgment on themselves&lt;/strong&gt;. That is why
many among you are &lt;strong&gt;weak and sick&lt;/strong&gt;, and a number of you have
fallen asleep. Nevertheless, when we are &lt;strong&gt;judged in this way by the
Lord&lt;/strong&gt;, we are being &lt;strong&gt;disciplined&lt;/strong&gt; so that we will not be finally
condemned with the world.&amp;quot; In other words, some believers are made
sick or die to rescue them from condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God uses disease to judge some unbelievers.&lt;br&gt;
Acts 12:23 &amp;quot;because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of
the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
Rom 1:18 &amp;quot;The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against
all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth
by their wickedness&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
Rom 1:27 &amp;quot;Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received
in themselves the due penalty for their error.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All natural disasters are a call to all men everywhere to repent:
Luke 13:1-4 &amp;quot;I tell you, unless you repent, you too will all
perish.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Piper presents a persuasive biblical argument - but it is somewhat
one-sided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First he jumps from &amp;quot;Jesus has the power to stop disaster&amp;quot; to
&amp;quot;Therefore Jesus must intend all disaster&amp;quot;. The second does not flow
from the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His reasons for not preventing disaster may be to do with his wider
purposes in subjecting everything to decay (Rom 8) rather than having a
specific purpose for each disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly he presents his four points very well, but offers no balancing
scriptures, such as Rom 2:1-11 where much of the judgement is being
stored up by God for judgement day, and instead kindness is meant to
lead people to repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is not about whether God sometimes judges believers and
unbelievers in this life, but whether that is the norm. I think we must
conclude that mercy and kindness is the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jonathan&#39;s Daily Prayer Guide</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/jonathans-daily-prayer-guide/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/jonathans-daily-prayer-guide/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-this-prayer-guide&#34;&gt;Using this prayer guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joy and power of prayer cannot be adequately described or explained.
It is a wonderful mystery that must be experienced through practice. In
prayer we lift our hearts to God and enter most deeply into the
relationship of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. In answer to prayer, God
moves mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words on these pages are not prayers in themselves. The words become
prayer only when they have sunk into the deepest places of our hearts
and rise up again as our own united with our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;em&gt;Morning Prayer&lt;/em&gt; every day for seven days. Try to stick to the same
time each day if you can. There is a very short guide for &lt;em&gt;Prayer Before
Bed&lt;/em&gt; as well which simply uses the same Psalm as morning prayer. Try to
use both forms of prayer each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt; for prayer begins with &lt;strong&gt;recognition&lt;/strong&gt; that God is here
with us and we become more deeply aware of His presence as we still our
minds with the prayer of &lt;strong&gt;stillness&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, thank you for your mercy to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Lord&amp;rsquo; because Jesus is God.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Christ&amp;rsquo; which means &amp;lsquo;anointed one&amp;rsquo; because Jesus was anointed with the
Holy Spirit as King.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Son of God&amp;rsquo; meaning Jesus is the Son in the Trinity of Father, Son and
Holy Spirit. The Son who has always existed with God the Father and the
Spirit and through whom all things were created.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;thank you for your mercy&amp;rsquo; because Jesus came and rescued us and gave us
what we didn&amp;rsquo;t deserve, eternal life in Him. So we begin with thanks for
His goodness to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this prayer of stillness start by praying the words out loud,
taking a breath half way through after &amp;lsquo;Son of God&amp;rsquo;. Focus your mind on
Jesus as you repeat the words. To begin with, lots of thoughts will come
into your mind about all kinds of things. Try not to follow these
thoughts. Instead, keep pulling your mind back to the words of the
prayer and to Jesus. Gradually your mind will become quieter and you can
start to pray the prayer silently in your mind. It helps to match the
words to your breathing so that you breathe in for &amp;lsquo;Lord Jesus Christ,
Son of God&amp;rsquo; and breathe out for &amp;lsquo;thank you for your mercy&amp;rsquo;. When you
feel peaceful and you feel the love of Jesus filling your heart you are
ready to begin praising God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise&lt;/strong&gt; follows thanksgiving. We use the words from the one of the
Apostle Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters which the first Christians would have prayed or
sung to worship Jesus together. The song of praise is followed by the
short prayer giving glory to the Holy Trinity &amp;lsquo;Glory to the Father&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;.
Try speaking both of these out loud or chanting or singing them. It
makes a powerful difference to how the words effect your heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we focus on the Bible, the &lt;strong&gt;Word of God&lt;/strong&gt;. Because it is inspired
by God it is not only the words of the human writers but, through the
power of the Holy Spirit, the Bible becomes God&amp;rsquo;s words to us leading us
to Himself, the source of all life; to Jesus who is The Word of God, The
Way, The Truth and The Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Psalms&lt;/strong&gt; were the prayers and songs of the Jewish people. As a
Jew, Jesus himself would have learned and recited the Psalms. Right from
the start Christians have taken the Psalms and reinterpreted them in the
light of Jesus and used them to worship and pray to Him as our Lord and
King. Here there are seven Psalms, one for each day, which we can pray,
chant or sing to lift our hearts to God. If you have time, it is helpful
to pray through the Psalm slowly by responding to and expanding on each
line with your own words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalm is followed by a &lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt; from the Old or New Testament. It
is good to read the short passage for the day several times until it
becomes familiar. Ask the Holy Spirit to speak to you through it and
bring you closer to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are ready to respond in our hearts to the reading there is a
written &lt;strong&gt;response&lt;/strong&gt; to focus our minds and hearts on Jesus. It also
includes a time of silence to allow the Holy Spirit to work in our
heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we feel the Holy Spirit drawing us to make &lt;strong&gt;requests&lt;/strong&gt; of the
Father we can begin with The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer, saying the words slowly,
pausing between each line to allow specific prayers to rise from our
hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer is followed by a time of &lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt;, praying in
our own words for specific people and things. At this point you should
expect the Holy Spirit to continue to guide you as you pray. You may
also find that your heart fills with a deep love for the people you are
praying for. This is one of the sweetest experiences of the love of God
flowing through you which is matched only by the sense of God&amp;rsquo;s love
felt as you serve people face to face with healing, encouragement,
generosity, hospitality and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a &lt;strong&gt;litany&lt;/strong&gt; at this point can help us keep concentration and
focus on one type of need at a time. It also helps us make sure to cover
a wide range of things in our prayers. But only use it if you find it
helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are ready to finish, we pray the &lt;strong&gt;closing prayer&lt;/strong&gt;. Pray it out
loud or silently, very slowly, pausing between each line to allow the
words to become a reality in your heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;strong&gt;the conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; closes the time of prayer and reminds us of our
dependency on God and His joy at blessing us as His beloved children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;morning-prayer-weekly-cycle&#34;&gt;Morning Prayer: weekly cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;recognition&#34;&gt;Recognition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts,&lt;br&gt;
Who brings us home to our loving Father.&lt;br&gt;
The Spirit of God is here in power,&lt;br&gt;
Jesus our Saviour is with us now and forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;stillness&#34;&gt;Stillness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repeat the following sentence silently and continuously until your mind
is still and your heart alive to the Spirit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, thank you for your mercy to me.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;colossians-113-18a-19-20a&#34;&gt;Colossians 1.13-18a, 19, 20a&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Father has delivered us from the power of darkness,&lt;br&gt;
and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son;&lt;br&gt;
In whom we have redemption,&lt;br&gt;
the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
He is the image of the invisible God,&lt;br&gt;
the firstborn over all creation.&lt;br&gt;
For in him all things were created,&lt;br&gt;
in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible.&lt;br&gt;
All things were created through him and for him,&lt;br&gt;
he is before all things and in him all things hold together.&lt;br&gt;
He is the head of the body, the Church,&lt;br&gt;
he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead.&lt;br&gt;
In him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell;&lt;br&gt;
and through him God was pleased to reconcile all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit; as it was
in the beginning is now&lt;br&gt;
and shall be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A litany is a list of topics for prayer. If you think it will help you,
memorise parts or all of this litany to help you pray for yourself and
others. When you use it, recite one paragraph and then pause to allow
prayers to rise from your heart in line with its focus. The Spirit will
bring to your mind specific issues or people to pray for. You can also
use it throughout the day to help you continue praying whenever you
remember. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to use all of it at once! Take it slowly and
gradually memorise more at your own pace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begin with the prayer of &lt;strong&gt;stillness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read and pray through the &lt;strong&gt;Psalm&lt;/strong&gt; from Morning Prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflect&lt;/strong&gt; on the day and &lt;strong&gt;thank&lt;/strong&gt; God for His presence and protection
throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End by reciting the &lt;strong&gt;Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer&lt;/strong&gt;, making space to pray in your own
words following each line if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclude with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In peace I will lie down and sleep&lt;br&gt;
For it is you Lord, only, who make me dwell in safety.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Leadership _ Jesus Style v2</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/leadership-_-jesus-style-v2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/leadership-_-jesus-style-v2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;leadership----jesus-style&#34;&gt;Leadership &amp;ndash; Jesus Style&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leadership-is-natural&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership is natural.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership is natural. Amongst any group of children in a playground a
leader will emerge. Every society in the world organises itself to have
leaders. They do so because they recognise that there is some worthwhile
goal that can only be achieved through common and organised effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because God has created us with this inbuilt desire to organise our
communities and to value leadership, some people have a natural desire
to lead and other people have a natural desire to be led. Some enjoy the
stimulation and challenge of leadership; others value the security of
following someone else&#39;s lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders therefore tend to be strong willed, determined, ambitious and
sometimes ruthless whereas followers tend to be compliant, willing,
easily persuaded and mild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leadership-has-been-corrupted-by-the-fall&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership has been corrupted by the fall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although God has designed leadership for our good, the fall has
corrupted it so that much harm has also been done. Some key aspects of
leadership that are commonly encountered in the world have no place in
the Kingdom of God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jesus called them together and said, &amp;quot;You know that those who are
regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high
officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead,
whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and
whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.&amp;rdquo; (Mk 10:42-44 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said that amongst the Gentiles leaders lord it over the people and
exercise authority but that it shall not be so among you. Sadly many
churches have ignored this command. It is common for churches to have
very controlling leaders. This is exactly how Jesus said it should not
be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kingdom-leadership-is-counter-cultural&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kingdom leadership is counter cultural&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdom leadership is fundamentally counter cultural. It is very
difficult for many leaders to accept that it is even possible to lead
effectively in a way that is contrary to their culture. We must not say
&amp;ldquo;in our culture you have to use authority to get anything done&amp;rdquo; since
Jesus expressly says that Kingdom leadership is counter cultural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gifting-responsibility-and-authority&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gifting, responsibility and authority&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All authority has been given to Jesus and he has given us authority as
his disciples and representatives. Primarily that authority is given to
each of us to establish God&#39;s Kingdom on earth. In his name we have
authority over sickness and all the works of the devil. Jn 20:21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are all unique and called to be members of the body of Christ
each contributing according to our gifting and ability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of
yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with
sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given
you. Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these
members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are
many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.&amp;rdquo; (Rom
12:3-5 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those contributions involve carrying responsibility within the
church. For instance, some are given the responsibility to lead God&#39;s
people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;if his gift is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing
to the needs of others, let him give generously; if it is leadership,
let him govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it
cheerfully.&amp;rdquo; (Rom 12:8 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some responsibilities come with special authority, but responsibility
and authority should not be confused. A responsibility is something you
&lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; do whereas authority is for something you &lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt; do. Many
people may have authority to do something that only one person has
responsibility for. For instance everyone may have authority to help put
out the chairs, but just one person, the janitor, has the responsibility
to make sure they are in place. The janitor may be given special
authority to enable him to fulfil his responsibility, such as the
authority to ask some members of the welcoming team to leave their duty
and to help with the chairs. In the Kingdom we are all called to love
and serve one another in joyful submission to Jesus our head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;esteem-your-leaders&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esteem your leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Thess 5:12-13. Paul urges the church to highly esteem those who are
over them in the Lord. Honour and respect is part of the Kingdom, but
this must not stray into superiority. In some cultures it may be
appropriate for a leader to wear special clothes or have a special place
to sit, but where these things are used to reinforce ungodly leadership
styles such as lording it over, or to make the leader appear superior,
then it is wrong. Remember that Jesus specifically warned against those
who sat in special seats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in
the synagogues and greetings in the market-places.&amp;rdquo; (Lu 11:43 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;authority-structures&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authority structures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches seem to love authority structures where authority is delegated
down from the head to various layers below. Such structures are a means
of control. Leaders love to be in control. Most leaders assume that it
is their duty to be in control and that such control is necessary to
fulfil the duty they have been appointed to. But this is not the model
that Jesus gives us, nor the model of the New Testament church. People
often talk about serving the leadership, but that is the reverse of what
Jesus taught. He said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and
to give his life as a ransom for many.&amp;quot; (Mk 10:45 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lording-it-over-people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lording it over people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lording it over is when someone says, &amp;ldquo;Because I am a special or a
superior person you should obey me.&amp;rdquo; e.g. Because I am &amp;ldquo;anointed by God&amp;rdquo;
or &amp;ldquo;Because I am God&amp;rsquo;s apostle or prophet&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;Because I am
educated&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I am an expert in this field&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I am a white man&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said that Lording it over is not appropriate in the Kingdom. The
exercise of leadership must not be based on a claim to superiority. We
should never say or imply, &amp;ldquo;Because I planted this church you should
obey me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;authority-over-people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authority over people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we may have authority amongst God&#39;s people because of our
particular area of service, we are not to use that authority as a means
of control. As with lording it over, we should not say or imply things
such as, &amp;ldquo;Because of my position you should obey me.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Because I am the
pastor...&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Because I am the youth leader...&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Because I am your
apostle...&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;Because I am your mother...&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Because I am a
policeman...&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the basis of the claim is different, both lording it over and
exercising authority is claiming a right to tell you what to do in order
to exercise control. They both expect and demand simple, unquestioning
obedience. This wrongful exercise of control depends on the people being
led feeling they have a duty to obey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly it is very common to see these mechanisms of control being taught
and promoted in churches. Leaders are commonly elevated by the use of
titles, special clothes, special treatment, special places to sit etc.
in order to make them appear special. People naturally treat such
elevated people as lords and so allow them and even expect them to lord
it over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are appointed to leadership positions are often given special
titles to honour them for the sacrifice and service they offer to the
church.  But Jesus expressly warned about seeking honour from men:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;they love to be honoured by men but not by God. They have their
reward on earth.&amp;quot; (Matt 6:2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking the glory of men has the effect of stopping us hearing from God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not
seek the glory that comes from the only God? (John 5:44)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A title may be useful to identify a person&#39;s role, but should not be
used to elevate them above those they lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, both elevation of leaders as special people and the creation of
positions of authority are common in churches as a means of control, but
both rely on people having a sense of duty to obey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;duty&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have a duty to obey God and give willing obedience to godly
leadership.  Hebrews 11:17 says &amp;ldquo;obey those who lead you and be
submissive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This obedience should be joyfully and willingly given, not demanded, and
not obtained through false teaching, such as &amp;ldquo;if you serve and obey me
without question God will bless you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches where the leaders like to be in control make much of the
command to obey the leaders. This is how leadership in the world works.
Jesus said it should not be like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kingdom-leadership&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kingdom leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Kingdom we are not to use control as a means of leadership. We
are not to require obedience from people or to rely on their sense of
duty. The Kingdom is supposed to be characterised by Joy: &amp;ldquo;The joy of
the Lord shall be your strength.&amp;rdquo; Demanding or shaming people to
obedience breeds resentment and unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdom leadership depends not upon authority and duty but on vision,
inspiration, empowerment and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leading-by-example&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading by example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter reiterates what Jesus said about leadership in the Kingdom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be shepherds of God&amp;rsquo;s flock that is under your care, serving as
overseers&amp;mdash;not because you must, but because you are willing, as God
wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve; not lording
it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. And
when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory
that will never fade away.&amp;rdquo; (1Pe 5:2-4 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.&amp;rdquo; (1Co 11:1 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see here that the character of a leader is crucial, not just the
ability to perform a task. Again this is counter-cultural. In the world
leaders are usually appointed either through favouritism or because of
the person&amp;rsquo;s skills. But in the Kingdom, &lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt; is the most important
quality. If the person does not live what they tell others to do, they
are not suitable for leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading by example is a very important principle which is often promoted
in churches and is a reflection of how Jesus led. It is when a leader
goes ahead of the people to show them what to do and demonstrate the
kind of behaviour he/she wishes to see from those he leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading by example is far more effective than leading by instruction and
people often resent being told what to do by a leader who has not or
will not do the task themselves. Also by doing the task themselves a
leader will learn about the difficulties experienced and will have
compassion for those he has asked to perform the task and try to provide
the means for them. Doctors learn how to perform surgery by watching one
being performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However leading by example is often exhausting and frustrating. A leader
should never sit idly by watching others work. The people we are trying
to lead are rarely as faithful as we wish, they are rarely as thorough
as we wish, and may not be as skilled as we wish. How a leader deals
with this situation is a test of godly leadership. There is no point
getting worked up about this, it is just a fact of life. But we may be
able to improve things by sharing our vision for the task more
effectively or by providing more training or resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leadership-in-the-home&#34;&gt;Leadership in the home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is much easier to behave well and serve one another in church that it
is at home. That is why Paul makes a godly home a qualification of
leadership in the church:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife,
temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not
a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see that his
children obey him with proper respect. (If anyone does not know how to
manage his own family, how can he take care of God&amp;rsquo;s church?)&amp;rdquo; (1Ti
3:2-5 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Godly servant leadership must be applied in our own homes if we are to
be authentic leaders in the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;servant-leadership&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Servant leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servant leadership is the least well understood aspect of Kingdom
leadership. It is very easy to talk about servant leadership and to
teach that we should be servant leaders without properly understanding
who is to be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All leadership is for the purpose of serving some agreed goal. Sales
managers for Coca-Cola serve the directors and shareholders and in
return receive their pay, but that does not make them servant leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders are called to serve Jesus and the vision of the church. But that
is not what servant leadership is about. Jesus said &amp;ldquo;I came not to be
served but to serve...&amp;rdquo; Servant leaders are those who serve the people
they are leading. This is commonly understood when it comes to the
pastor, but what about those with smaller spheres of leadership such as
a choir leader? Who exactly are they called to serve? They have two
areas of service which are simply the duty of any leader; they serve
their immediate &amp;ldquo;superior&amp;rdquo; (their pastor) and they serve their ultimate
superior (Jesus). But those areas of service are not what servant
leadership is about. To be a servant leader they must also serve the
people they are leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the example Jesus gave us to follow - to serve those we lead. In
the Kingdom leadership is a service that we offer to the body of Christ.
Each one of us is called to serve Christ and to be an ambassador of the
Kingdom. We pray &amp;ldquo;Your Kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven&amp;rdquo;; that
is our common goal and is the purpose of the church. We can serve that
goal in hundreds of different ways, some of which are best accomplished
in teams with a leader.  The leader serves the members by helping them
to achieve a goal they value.  This leadership service may include
inspiring someone with confidence to aim for something they would never
have believed possible. It may include rousing them when they feel tired
to put in effort that they would otherwise not have the discipline to do
for themselves. Leadership service includes clearly explaining the
reason for the task being performed and envisioning the team members so
that they willingly give sufficient priority to the team activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servant leadership does not include coercing members to do what they
don&#39;t want to do. We must not resort to threats, or shame, or the
appeal to our authority or to a person&#39;s duty to obey.  These are all
attempts to control a person and that is not a part of Kingdom
leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person is not willing to participate in the way the leader wishes
then the leader must go back to Jesus with the problem. Either the
leader&amp;rsquo;s goal is wrong, or they have failed to share the vision for the
goal clearly enough, or else the person is inappropriate for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leadership-teams&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership teams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooperation between leaders is often difficult to achieve. The problem
is that they are all leaders and not used to being led. Cooperation
requires leaders to allow others to set their direction. Genuine
cooperation between leaders only occurs when they recognise that a goal
they value can only be achieved through cooperation. The task of leading
a leadership team is therefore fundamentally one of identifying a common
goal and envisioning the team so that they willingly subjugate their own
priorities for the sake of this greater goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, where the team is brought together with the specific purpose of
encouraging leaders to share their experience and to influence one
another in order to shape the direction of the church and its mission,
teams can work very well and become very open to the Holy Spirit&amp;rsquo;s
leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;authority-structures-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authority structures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Jesus says that authority should not be used to exercise control
in the Kingdom, we should be wary of hierarchical authority structures
in the church. Jesus is the head and we are all members of his body, and
before Christ none is more important than another. We are all answerable
to Jesus as our authority. All Jesus&#39; sheep hear his voice. Each of us
have gifts we bring to the body.  Some are gifts of service and others
are gifts of leadership. Just because a person serves through leading
does not make them more important to Jesus and it does not give them a
right to control people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of authority it is better to think of a flat structure rather
than a hierarchy. A flat structure helps to remind us that leadership is
not about control but is offered as a service alongside all the other
kinds of service performed. We should not be demanding obedience from
those we lead. Peter says that obedience should be offered freely
without compulsion. 1 Peter 5:2-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;communication-structures&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication structures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although authority structures are better thought of as flat,
communication structures may need to be hierarchical in a larger church
for purely practical purposes. But friendships should be nurtured across
such structures.  It is very unhealthy for a pastor to only have other
leaders as friends. They soon forget what it is like to be a member of
the congregation, and can make unreasonable demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;delegation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegation is often used as a means of multiplying servants in the
church. This may be good for sustaining the church program, but it may
not be good for the wider calling on the church. The crying need of the
Kingdom is not servants but servant-leaders. We need to be sending
disciples into all the world to make disciples. The church should not be
focused on its own programs but on training and releasing leaders. For
this to happen, delegation should be seen as a way of multiplying
leaders, not just servants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we see delegation as a means of multiplying servants or leaders
will determine how we appoint leaders. If we want servants we will
appoint compliant leaders, &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; men who will not give us trouble, or we
may look primarily for natural leaders who can motivate and command
obedience.  But if we want to produce leaders for the Kingdom we will
look for those with a passion for Christ and the ability to hear Him. We
will look for people who are developing their own unique calling. We
will not want to control them but to develop them. They may or may not
be natural leaders; either way Kingdom leadership principles and values
must be nurtured. Kingdom leadership is more about character than
skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often a real challenge to the existing leadership. Where
leadership is used as a means of control you will not develop leaders,
but only servants. You might call them leaders, but the reality is you
want servants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;releasing-leaders&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Releasing leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader with true Kingdom vision will want to train and release
leaders, not just train people to serve his own vision. Jesus is the
King and we must release leaders to serve Him. To develop leaders you
need to give authority and freedom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and
authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent
them out to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick.&amp;rdquo; (Lu 9:1-2
NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader who has no authority to take initiative and make decisions will
never be more than a servant. As a leader grows in their faith and
ability they need to be given more freedom to serve Jesus directly,
without constant supervision and the requirement to report back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A beautiful example of this is given by Mary at the wedding in Cana.
Mary has a situation that needs sorting out. She leaves the
responsibility to Jesus and the servants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee &amp;hellip; When the
wine was gone, Jesus&#39; mother said to him, &amp;ldquo;They have no more wine.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;hellip; His mother said to the servants, &amp;ldquo;Do whatever he tells you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders need to learn to do more than faithfully perform a duty. They
need to learn how to hear from God, receive or develop a vision, search
the scriptures to learn what God says about their vision, inspire others
to embrace the vision, and persevere through many setbacks and
discouragements to see the vision become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;releasing-churches&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Releasing churches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church belongs to Jesus and he is the head. The umbilical cord
between a mother church and a church plant should therefore be cut as
soon as possible to encourage dependence upon Jesus and rapid growth.
However because church leaders are often tempted by the lure of
&amp;quot;kingdom building&amp;rdquo; they rarely release leaders fully. They want to
retain control, even over church plants. Leaders want to impose their
version of church over other churches. The excuse usually given for the
mother church to retain authority over a church plant is in order to
ensure it keeps to the vision and values. But what right does one church
have to act as the head of another? Jesus is the head. As soon as a
church can stand on its own it should be released to Jesus. Of course
relationships of friendship and mutual support should remain and the
mother church may continue to serve the church plant with training and
other resources, but the retention of control should be seriously
questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-labourer-is-worthy-of-his-wages&#34;&gt;The labourer is worthy of his wages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus and the apostles taught that labourer is worthy of his wages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stay in that house, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for
the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.
&amp;quot;When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is set before you.
Heal the sick who are there and tell them, &amp;lsquo;The kingdom of God is near
you.&#39;&amp;rdquo; (Lu 10:7-9 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But note that Jesus is very particular about eating whatever you are
given. In other words, accept the hospitality or rewards offered rather
than demanding to be treated like royalty. The rewards or wages of
ministry are gifts to be gratefully received, not demanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t we have the right to food and drink? Don&amp;rsquo;t we have the right to
take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the
Lord&amp;rsquo;s brothers and Cephas? Or is it only I and Barnabas who must work
for a living? ... If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too
much if we reap a material harvest from you? If others have this right
of support from you, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we have it all the more? ...In the
same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel
should receive their living from the gospel.&amp;quot; 1 Cor 9:5-6, 11-12, 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul presents a forceful argument for his right to receive wages for his
ministry in the Gospel (although as verse 18 shows, he did not make use
of this right) and he urges churches to honour that right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of
double honour, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching.
For the Scripture says, &amp;quot;Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading
out the grain,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The worker deserves his wages.&amp;quot;&amp;rdquo; (1Ti 5:17-18
NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may well be that some members of a church may wish to offer those
wages in practical service as well as or instead of money. But remember
that giving, whether service or money should be done willingly and
joyfully and without any compulsion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not
reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.&amp;rdquo; (2Co
9:7 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no New Testament support for requiring members to serve the
pastor in his home duties or for the pastor having menial tasks
performed for him by members. The wages given to a Gospel worker are to
enable him to serve without restraint, not to elevate him above the
congregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-five--fold-ministries&#34;&gt;The five -fold ministries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to apostles Jesus has given prophets, evangelists, pastors
and teachers, to equip the church in ministry.  They are not given to do
all the ministry but to equip others to do the ministry. So for example,
all are encouraged by Paul to zealously pursue the gift of prophecy and
all are encouraged to hear God for themselves, but prophets are given to
encourage and inspire others in growing in these areas. They also have a
role in helping to discern what God is saying to the church through the
body. A prophet must not use his role as a means of control. He must not
seek to control the congregation, or the leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the ministry gifts are given to serve the church in their
obedience to Jesus. Each ministry should operate in love and mutual
submission to all the other ministries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these are given by Jesus to the church, it is not up to the pastor
or apostle to simply appoint people to these offices. Rather it is a
matter of recognising those whom Jesus has appointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;apostolic-authority&#34;&gt;Apostolic authority&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some churches much is made of apostolic authority. I wish to make a
few brief points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apostles-are-for-mission-not-control&#34;&gt;Apostles are for mission, not control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus chose the twelve, we are told he called them &amp;ldquo;apostles&amp;rdquo; which
means &amp;ldquo;sent ones&amp;rdquo;. This tells us that apostleship is not primarily about
authority over churches but mission. Remember that the great commission
is to go into all the world to spread the good news of the Kingdom, not
just to run churches. Christ gives apostles to the church to serve them
in mission not to control them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Through him and for his name&amp;rsquo;s sake, we received grace and
apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the
obedience that comes from faith.&amp;rdquo; (Ro 1:5 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apostles-have-authority-in-the-churches-they-plant&#34;&gt;Apostles have authority in the churches they plant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the calling on an apostle is to &amp;ldquo;go into all the world...&amp;rdquo; and
plant churches, it is natural that during the early years of a church
the apostle will have authority in the churches they helped plant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;... built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with
Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.&amp;rdquo; (Eph 2:20 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apostles plant churches and become &amp;quot;foundational&amp;quot; through relationship.
The church is not founded by studying a systematic theology, but by the
example, teaching and instruction of the apostle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They devoted themselves to the apostles&amp;rsquo; teaching and to the
fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.&amp;rdquo; (Ac 2:42 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is natural and proper for a church to give close attention to the
biblical teaching of the apostle. That is how the Kingdom works -
through people and relationships. Jesus works the truth into us and out
through us. And so Paul urges the churches to follow the pattern he has
passed on to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with
faith and love in Christ Jesus.&amp;rdquo; (2Ti 1:13 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship is forged in love and fatherly concern and care. The
relationship naturally includes an aspect of authority, but the exercise
of that authority must be subject to scripture, including testing what
the apostle is saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians,
for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the
Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.&amp;rdquo; (Ac 17:11
NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apostles-bring-teaching-directly-to-the-church&#34;&gt;Apostles bring teaching directly to the church&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the apostolic relationship is genuinely relational and
foundational then it is to be expected that the apostle will relate
directly with the church members and not only through the leadership.
They may therefore bring correction directly to a church without
deferring to the leadership. We see this in the various epistles where
teaching is addressed directly to church members. However this apostolic
relationship must not usurp the autonomy of the local church or
undermine the leadership. Paul repeatedly urges the people to honour and
respect their leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apostles-may-advise-leaders&#34;&gt;Apostles may advise leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visiting ministries are able to take a more objective view of things
than is possible for those in local leadership, and as such may offer
advice about vision, focus, church programs or practices. The apostle
will want to see that leaders are being developed and released to new
ministries rather than the local church program simply growing ever
bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches can very easily become inward looking or maintenance minded
whereas the Apostle&amp;rsquo;s calling to &amp;ldquo;go&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; will help to keep the wider
calling to mission before the leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is all too easy for leaders to expect members to come to multiple
meetings each week and to make attendance a mark of commitment or
discipleship. The effect may be to burden people with heavy expectations
that are difficult for them to meet and may detract from discipleship
and mission as people spend less time amongst unbelievers because they
spend so much time at church meetings. Jesus warned about overloading
people with requirements that are not from Jesus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tie up heavy loads and put them on men&amp;rsquo;s shoulders, but they
themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. (Matt 23:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apostles-may-bring-correction-to-leaders&#34;&gt;Apostles may bring correction to leaders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where leadership proves to be false or hypocritical, we see both Jesus
and Paul publicly reprimanding leadership:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues ... Indignant
because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler said to the
people, &amp;ldquo;There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those
days, not on the Sabbath.&amp;rdquo; The Lord answered him, &amp;ldquo;You hypocrites!
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall
and lead it out to give it water?&amp;rdquo; (Lk 13:10,14-15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was
clearly in the wrong. (Gal 2:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostle may have a duty to intervene if things go badly wrong with
the church leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apostolic-delegates&#34;&gt;Apostolic Delegates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An apostle may send someone in his place as a delegate for a particular
purpose as Paul did, sending Timothy, but it is hard to see how the
apostolic role can be delegated, since it is Jesus who gives these
gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/leadership-relationships/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/leadership-relationships/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;leadership-relationships&#34;&gt;Leadership relationships &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;love&#34;&gt;Love &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love between believers is the first and fundamental commandment of
Jesus, yet many leaders seem to think that leadership takes priority
over love. Certainly leadership often requires difficult decisions and
should not bow to favouritism, but the exercise of leadership can never
justify acts that are contrary to genuine godly love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 6:1 Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you
who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch
yourselves, or you also may be tempted.** **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;openness&#34;&gt;Openness &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may
be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of
God.&amp;rdquo; (John 3:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship
with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from
all sin. (1 John 1:7 )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders must walk in the light together; they must be open with one
another about their vision for the future they seek to lead people to
and their own strengths and weaknesses. Leadership must be shared so
that the variety of contributions that Christ has provided in the church
can all contribute to a wholesome and healthy leadership team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;integrity&#34;&gt;Integrity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders must live what they preach as far as they are able. They must
lead by example and not just by exhortation. And this example must
include the way they handle leadership relationships and leadership
difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;handling-leadership-conflict&#34;&gt;Handling Leadership Conflict&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-leaders-response-to-accusations-against-them&#34;&gt;A leader&amp;rsquo;s response to accusations against them &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders must learn how to handle accusations against them and
disagreements with other leaders. Leadership is a high calling and comes
with great responsibilities. The standard of love for leaders is high.
John says  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for
us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.&amp;rdquo;
(1 John 3:16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader&amp;rsquo;s first response to accusations or disagreements should be to
lay down his life rather than defend himself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, for Christ&amp;rsquo;s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults,
in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak,
then I am strong. (2 Corinthians 12:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the example Jesus left for us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do
good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you
and persecute you. (Matthew 5:44)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you
endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is
a gracious thing in the sight of God. For to this you have been
called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example,
so that you might follow in his steps. (1 Peter 2:20-21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is how Jesus wants us to behave towards the enemies of the
truth, how much more should we show this forgiveness and love towards
our fellow leaders. Sadly, leaders are so often very defensive, strongly
defending and justifying their actions and respond to accusations with
accusations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forgiveness&#34;&gt;Forgiveness &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus warned us that if we do not forgive those who sin against us,
neither will our Father forgive us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;responsibility-for-conflict-resolution&#34;&gt;Responsibility for conflict resolution &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the body of Christ is responsible for conflict resolution.
No one who sees conflict has the right to stand by and say nothing. We
must all guard the unity of Christ&amp;rsquo;s body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But leaders clearly have the prime responsibility to resolve conflict.
Again, no leader can stand aside saying &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not my responsibility&amp;rdquo; but
the lead leader is ultimately responsible before God for those in his
care, and he must not shirk the responsibly for resolving conflicts that
arise within his church or in his leadership team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-causes-of-conflict&#34;&gt;The causes of conflict &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective teams will have a willingness to disagree, yet hold each other
accountable to not move into destructive conflict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict arises out of a perceived inadequate response to a problem or
disagreement. For instance, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t feel you have given sufficient
consideration to my view.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause may be serious moral or doctrinal error which may require a
matter to be confronted and may result in conflict. But it is more
usually a disagreement about vision, strategy, roles, structure,
implementation or personal preferences that ought to be resolved without
conflict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to identify the actual problem that gave rise to the
conflict. James suggests that we need to start by searching our own
hearts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don&amp;rsquo;t they come from your
desires that battle within you? (James 4:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict between people is often the result of conflict within an
individual. This inner conflict may not be obvious to that person. When
we feel the need to speak or act in way that could give rise to
conflict, we should first ask God to help us examine our own heart to
reveal what is causing this strong emotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following questions should be prayerfully considered both
individually and collectively to identify how the conflict has arisen: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the problem that has given rise to this conflict? Try to dig
down to the root issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What part has each person contributed to this conflict arising? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What part is pride playing in this conflict? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What part are mistakes, inexperience or inadequate knowledge
playing? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;resolving-conflict&#34;&gt;Resolving conflict &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict resolution is about winning hearts not arguments. It requires
that each person listens carefully to the other, and then echoes back in
as few words as possible what they think they have heard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following questions should be prayerfully considered both
individually and collectively to try and find a godly way forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we being open with each other about the real issues? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there behavioural issues that need addressing? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we imitate and glorify Jesus in handling this issue? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we bring in a peace-maker to help us resolve this in a godly
way? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What positive thing would each person like to come out of resolving
this issue? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initiating-conflict&#34;&gt;Initiating conflict &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before initiating a potential conflict consider the following advice: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never react in the heat of the moment. Get at least one night&amp;rsquo;s
sleep between the decision to initiate the potential conflict and
the implementation of that decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray until you are sure that this is what Jesus wants you to do.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek the advice of an experienced leader who is not involved in the
situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss the wisdom of your intention with your spouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss the wisdom of your intention with your fellow leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are sure you should initiate a potential conflict, only raise
the essential issue. Do not raise any non-essential side issues.
They will become the focus instead of the core issue and make
resolution much more difficult.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When raising the issue do not make accusations against the other
person. Stick to your own observations and feelings, and report only
facts, not hearsay. Remember that you are trying to establish truth,
not win an argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;healthy-church-audit&#34;&gt;Healthy church audit &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many churches find it helpful to have a &amp;ldquo;healthy church audit&amp;rdquo;. You
invite a leader from another church to interview a cross section of the
leadership and the wider congregation in order to discover of they
really have a common vision and to see if the teaching, pastoral and
leadership functions within the church are healthy and effective. They
then report back to the leadership team to help them improve the quality
of their leadership. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Leadership Self Evaluation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/leadership-self-evaluation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/leadership/leadership-self-evaluation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REDPATH&amp;rsquo;S SELF-EXAMINATION QUESTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christians life is sometimes complicated in that it often requires
us to walk a balance. It is easy to run to one extreme or another, and
the enemy of our soul is happy for us to follow one extreme as the
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area where balance is necessary is the place of self-examination.
Too much looking inward, too much self-examination, is a bad thing. The
focus of the Christian life is Jesus Christ, not self. We are to die to
self and live to Jesus. On the other side, to &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; spend time in true
self-examination is also dangerous. We must, from time to time, examine
our life and work ( spend time in true self-examination is also
dangerous. We must, from time to time, examine our life and work (1
Corinthians 11:28, 2 Corinthians 13:5, and Galatians 6:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I read this section by Alan Redpath, taken from his
wonderful book on Nehemiah, &lt;em&gt;Victorious Christian Service&lt;/em&gt;. I recommend
it to you as a good checklist of self-examination, and trust that you
will use it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SELF-EXAMINATION QUESTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Alan Redpath&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago at an all-night of prayer in my church I read a list I use
myself called &amp;ldquo;Self-examination questions,&amp;rdquo; because I am desperately
concerned in my own life on these things. I want to give this list to
you, lest you think it is a comfortable, easy sort of business, this
recognition of sin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MEN?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I consciously or unconsciously creating the impression that I am a
better man than I really am? Is there the least suspicion of hypocrisy
in my life? Am I honest in all my words and acts? Do I exaggerate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I reliable? Can I be trusted? Do I confidentially pass on what was
told to me in confidence? Do I grumble and complain in the church?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I jealous, impure, irritable, touchy, distrustful? Am I self-
conscious, self-pitying, or self-justifying? Am I proud? Do I thank God
I am not as other people? Is there anyone I fear, or dislike, or
criticize, or resent? If so, what am I doing about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT ABOUT MY DEVOTION TO GOD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the Bible live to me? Do I give it time to speak to me? Do I go to
bed in time and do I get up in time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I enjoying my prayer life today? Did I enjoy it this morning? When I
am involved in a problem in life, do I talk about it or pray about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I disobeying God in anything, or insisting upon doing something about
which my conscience is very uneasy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did I last speak to someone else with the object of trying to win
him for Christ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I a slave to books, dress, friends, work, or what others think? How
do I spend my spare time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALAN REDPATH, &lt;em&gt;VICTORIUS CHRISTIAN SERVICE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unlockingthebible.org/author/kevin-halloran/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kevin Halloran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our physical lives need routine check-ups to see that we are healthy and
to prevent and diagnose health problems before they become a major
threat to our lives. Our spiritual lives are susceptible to problems as
well and require self-examination in order to purge the unhealthy
tendencies we have and replace them with the habits that God desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 7 Questions to evaluate where you are in the Christian life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Am I praying with faith?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have asked, &amp;ldquo;Am I praying?&amp;rdquo;  That would be a good question, but
this question goes further.  In Luke 18, Jesus teaches us that we ought
always to pray. Then at the end of that teaching he asks a question:
&amp;ldquo;When the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth?&amp;rdquo; Notice, He
doesn&amp;rsquo;t ask, &amp;ldquo;Will the son of man find prayer on the earth?&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;Will
the son of man find faith on the earth?&amp;rdquo; Why? Because what matters is
not that I am saying my prayers, like the Pharisees did, and like
millions of people in all religions around the world do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matters is that I&amp;rsquo;m praying with faith. Do I have confidence in God
to do more than I can do? Or have I wandered into the spiritual
wasteland of evaluating everything in terms of what I see as humanly
possible&amp;mdash;the easiest thing to do when you&amp;rsquo;ve been a Christian for 10,
20, 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Am I serving with zeal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take this question straight from the Scriptures. Romans 12:8 says &amp;ldquo;The
one who leads,&amp;rdquo; must lead &amp;ldquo;with zeal.&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s something about passion
here, something about vision and something about direction. The leader
must care passionately about where he or she is going. 1 Peter 5:2 says
to leaders, &amp;ldquo;Be shepherds of God&amp;rsquo;s flock that is under your care,
serving as overseers, not because you must but because you are willing
as God wants you to be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the film, Parenthood, Steve Martin plays an overworked father trying
to do his best for a family under pressure. One day he quits his job,
and when he gets home, he finds the kids running wild and his wife tells
him that she is pregnant. He does not react well.  Then when it&amp;rsquo;s time
to take his son to a baseball game, his wife wants to talk and she says,
&amp;ldquo;Do you have to?&amp;rdquo; He says, &amp;ldquo;My whole life is &amp;lsquo;have to.&#39;&amp;rdquo; You&amp;rsquo;ve been
there, and so have I. But that&amp;rsquo;s not a place from which we can lead
others. Are you serving with zeal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Am I believing with confidence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God says that &amp;ldquo;the gospel&amp;hellip; is the power of God for salvation to
everyone who believes&amp;rdquo; (Romans 1:16). Do I believe that? Do I believe
that when I pray for an unbelieving friend or relative? Do I believe
that God is able to save them through the Gospel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I struggle with a powerful temptation, with a habit that is
difficult to overcome, do I believe that God is able to deliver me
through the Gospel? When I become tired, get discouraged, begin to
wonder how long I can continue, do I believe that the God who saved me
is able to keep me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Am I confessing with humility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Luther said, &amp;ldquo;When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said
&amp;lsquo;Repent,&amp;rsquo; He meant that the whole life of a believer should be
repentance.&amp;rdquo;  Christ calls us, not to a prayer of repentance, but to
a life of repentance, a life of turning ever more fully to Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A life of repentance is not a life of misery, but a life of growth. It&amp;rsquo;s
a life in which the Holy Spirit is constantly opening your eyes to how
you can take the next step in becoming more like Jesus. A process of
examination like this may begin to connect this reality with your life
now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Christian is a person who has light to see what there needs to be less
of and what there needs to be more of in his or her life. This leads to
a life of confession, in which you see your sins and your failings, and
you keep bringing them under the blood of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you live life like this, you don&amp;rsquo;t waste your life in the shallow
water of compromised obedience, instead you launch out into the deep
oceans of following Christ.  Can you name a sin that you have confessed
in the last week?  In the last month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Am I worshipping with joy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come to worship. Do I participate or do I observe? In the presence of
Jesus, there will not be a single person with their arms folded,
listening to the angels and observing the worship. We will all sing. We
will all shout for joy. Ask yourself, &amp;ldquo;Am I worshipping with joy?&amp;rdquo; If
not, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Am I giving with gladness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving is an indicator of love within marriage. A marriage that&amp;rsquo;s marked
by withholding is not healthy. Giving is also an indicator of your love
for Christ and your love for the bride of Christ. &amp;ldquo;I work to earn money
that I gladly give to the bride.&amp;rdquo; Is that true of me? Or am I tiring of
that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Am I reaching out with love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are in a world of need, and some Christians are stretched out in
sacrifice, so that lost people on their way to an eternal darkness may
see the light of Christ through the Gospel and be saved. What about you?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Listening To Jesus Conference</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/listening-to-jesus-conference/listening-to-jesus-conference/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/listening-to-jesus-conference/listening-to-jesus-conference/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to the Listening To Jesus conference.Aim&lt;/strong&gt;: To become a truly
prophetic people who hear and obey our extraordinary Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening-to-jesus-conference----session-1-03102020-one-thing-is-needful&#34;&gt;Listening To Jesus Conference &amp;ndash; Session 1 (03/10/2020) One Thing is Needful&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing I encouraged you to do on our last visit, at our final
gathering at Joseph&#39;s place, was to dream dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are called to do the impossible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all busy people who get things done. That is how God has made us
and He has used our &amp;quot;get things done&amp;quot; character to get things done in
His Kingdom. But we are called to do the impossible. His dreams are
bigger than ours. We are called to be risk takers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need to be obsessed by Jesus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to be fruitful in our risky endeavours we need to listen carefully
to Jesus. We need to eat and drink Jesus. We need to get away to a
lonely place and listen to Jesus. We need to be obsessed by Jesus and
not by the things we try to do in His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our tendency is to make Him safe and acceptable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus lived according to Kingdom culture and that often clashed with his
native culture. That is the essence of living a prophetic life;
courageously walking the Kingdom where it is contrary to our native
culture. But our tendency is to make Jesus conform to our culture to
make Him safe and acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We can easily become inoculated against Jesus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid 19 has set the world on an unprecedented search for a vaccine to
inoculate us against the virus. Vaccines generally work by presenting to
our immune system a cut-down safe version of the virus, so that our body
can recognise the virus and trigger its defence system to prevent it
doing us harm. Christians face the opposite problem. Through frequent
exposure to the Gospels, especially when made safe for public
consumption, we can easily become inoculated against Jesus! We can nod
in recognition of the familiar stories without letting them infect us.
We have defences against the words that challenge the status quo. We can
easily end up like the Pharisees in the Gospels, thinking that we are
OK; it&#39;s the others who need to hear this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listening to Jesus needs to be a high priority in our lives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my hope for these conferences is to re-expose us to the dangerous
Jesus so that we get thoroughly infected by Him. My dream is that we all
become obsessed with Jesus; that listening to Jesus becomes a high
priority in our lives; that we become a truly prophetic people who hear
and obey our extraordinary Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your response to this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You are worried and upset about many things, but one thing is
needed&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 10:38 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a
village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a
sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord&amp;rsquo;s feet listening to what he
said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be
made. She came to him and asked, &amp;ldquo;Lord, don&amp;rsquo;t you care that my sister
has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Martha, Martha,&amp;rdquo; the Lord answered, &amp;ldquo;you are worried and upset about
many things, but few things are needed&amp;mdash;or indeed only one. Mary has
chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Jesus saying to you through this incident?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discipleship is not about doctrine or behaviour. It is teaching people
to listen to Jesus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary need that all of us have is to sit with and listen to Jesus.
Discipleship is not about teaching people good doctrine, or good
behaviour. It is teaching people to listen to Jesus. Everything else
flows naturally from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Jesus want you to do about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your own devotional life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your own Growth Group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your leadership role?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your discipling of others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your church?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening-to-jesus-conference----session-2-10102020-familiarity-breeds-contempt&#34;&gt;Listening To Jesus Conference &amp;ndash; Session 2 (10/10/2020) Familiarity Breeds Contempt&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our calling is to give Jesus to people&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our calling is to release the Kingdom of God into people&#39;s lives and
communities; it is to give Jesus to them so that they can respond to
Jesus&#39; invitation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt 11:28-30 &amp;quot;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I
will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am
gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For
my yoke is easy and my burden is light.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this how you see your mission?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need to &amp;quot;camp&amp;quot; in the Gospels and feed on Jesus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot listen for you, nor can I make you listen, but I can invite you
to sit at Jesus feet with me. If I visit your home you find a seat for
me to sit in whilst we talk. I can give you a chair to sit in at Jesus
feet. As a shepherd I cannot put the grass in your mouth and make you
eat, but I can take you to where the grass is green and invite you to
eat. When you find good pasture, you want to stay there and enjoy it. I
call this &amp;quot;camping in the scripture&amp;quot;. I pitch my tent and stay there,
usually for at least a week or two, and often much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here now is the pasture I want to invite you to camp in with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A clash between Kingdom and native culture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 4:14-30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story of Jesus loving the people he loves most &amp;ndash; those He
grew up with. But it is a very surprising story. This is dangerous
Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about
him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their
synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he
had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the
synagogue, as was his custom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only two people mentioned by name in this story. One is Jesus,
the other is His father, Joseph. I want you to imagine you are Joseph.
And to help you get into character I&#39;m going to do a little imagining.
So close your eyes and put yourself into the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything looks nice, everyone is happy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has come early today to try and get a seat. Look around you.
Here are all your friends and family, that you have grown up with and
know intimately. This is your synagogue, which your parents helped to
build when you were a child. You helped carry the water and mould the
mud bricks. You remember the day when the community held the first
synagogue service here. You feel secure and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today there is much excitement because in recent weeks, your first son
Jesus has become the talk of the town and all the towns round about. He
has become a powerful and popular preacher in the district. He is coming
home today and everyone wants to hear all His stories. The Rabbi said it
wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for Jesus to talk about Himself in the service,
so He is just reading the lesson. But we are all staying afterwards to
hear His stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the familiar service gets underway your mind wanders back to the last
time you saw Jesus, 12 Sabbaths ago. That Friday afternoon as you were
clearing up the workshop in preparation for the Sabbath, Jesus cleaned
his tools and put them away, then he turned to you, looked you in the
eyes and said, &amp;quot;Father. It is finished.&amp;quot; You feel again the shiver
that went down your spine at these words. You asked Jesus what He meant.
He said, &amp;quot;I have completed the work I have to do for you. I must now go
and do my &lt;em&gt;heavenly&lt;/em&gt; Father&#39;s work.&amp;quot; He left that afternoon for
Jerusalem and you haven&#39;t seen Him since. Today He has come home. Your
attention comes back as Jesus is asked to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They all love the reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed
to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to
proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for
the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the
oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat
down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He
began by saying to them, &amp;ldquo;Today this scripture is fulfilled in your
hearing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came
from his lips. &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this Joseph&amp;rsquo;s son?&amp;rdquo; they asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone looks at you, and your heart brims with pride at how one of
your sons has become such a renowned and popular preacher. You can&#39;t
wait for the service to end so you can hear Jesus tell of all the
healings that you have heard about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are smiles on everyone&#39;s faces and the service is about to move
onto the prayers and the final blessing. But we never get to the
prayers. The service ends in utter chaos &amp;ndash; worse than that, it ends in
a riot! Just as the Rabbi is about to start the prayers, Jesus speaks
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus deliberately provokes them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Surely you will quote this proverb to me:
&amp;lsquo;Physician, heal yourself!&amp;rsquo; And you will tell me, &amp;lsquo;Do here in your
hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.&amp;rsquo; Truly I tell
you,&amp;rdquo; he continued, &amp;ldquo;no prophet is accepted in his hometown. I assure
you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah&amp;rsquo;s time, when the
sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine
throughout the land. Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a
widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. And there were many in
Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of
them was cleansed&amp;mdash;only Naaman the Syrian.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of
the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the
cliff. But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&#39;t move with shock. You are the only one left sitting in the
synagogue, but you see it all through the open door. You are shocked and
shaken. You are confused and dismayed. You can hardly believe what has
just happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus walks away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing you see is Jesus walking away from the village. And now
here you are; alone, wondering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What did Joseph think?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying in character as Joseph, what is your reaction to this incident?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What other characters are there that we could imagine being? - an angry
member of the congregation, the leading Rabbi, an uncomprehending child,
one of Jesus&#39; disciples, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, God the Father, a
passer-by, a sparrow! And finally, a 21^st^ century reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you think?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a 21^st^ century reader what are your immediate reactions / thoughts
/ questions about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did Jesus provoke them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did they react so strongly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did Jesus walk away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No prophet is accepted in his hometown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s try to answer some of these questions by thinking about what
Jesus said after the people said &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this Joseph&amp;rsquo;s son?&amp;rdquo; (v22):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Surely you will quote this proverb to me:
&amp;lsquo;Physician, heal yourself!&amp;rsquo; And you will tell me, &amp;lsquo;Do here in your
hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although outwardly the entire congregation are enthusiastic about what
Jesus said, in their hearts, Jesus knows they are sceptical about the
reports they have been hearing from nearby Capernaum. The reason for
this is indicated by the next thing Jesus says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly I tell you,&amp;rdquo; he continued, &amp;ldquo;no prophet is accepted in his
hometown.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a prophet?&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Someone whom God has called to bring God&#39;s
specific revelation to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it mean to &amp;quot;accept&amp;quot; a prophet&lt;/strong&gt; (what kind of response is
God looking for?) &amp;ndash; Give special consideration to what they have to
say; to listen carefully in the expectation that God wants to say
something important to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is a prophet not accepted in his hometown?&lt;/strong&gt; The congregation see
Jesus as a familiar member of their community &amp;ndash; someone they grew up
with. They do not think of him as anyone special. They are used to
discussing ideas as all equally valid, from which they hope to come to
some common agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was this not a problem at Capernaum?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can the Gospel stories become too familiar to impact us?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think we can become so familiar with the Gospel stories that we
miss what Jesus wants to say to us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening-to-jesus-conference----session-3-17oct2020-we-dont-like-being-challenged&#34;&gt;Listening To Jesus conference &amp;ndash; Session 3 (17/Oct/2020) We don&#39;t like being challenged!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim&lt;/strong&gt;: To become a truly prophetic people who hear and obey our
extraordinary Lord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus lived according to Kingdom culture and that often clashed with his
native culture. We are called to courageously walk in Kingdom culture
where it is contrary to our native culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our first session we reminded ourselves that, like Mary, we must
listen to Jesus and not just busy ourselves with many distractions like
Martha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reminded you that discipleship is not about teaching people good
doctrine, or good behaviour. It is teaching people to listen to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, in our second session, I reminded you that our mission is to
bring people to Jesus so they can find rest for their souls in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we looked at Luke 4:14-30 - Jesus visiting his home synagogue
after His baptism. We thought about this story from Joseph&#39;s point of
view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is Jesus saying to you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read this story a few months ago I felt the Holy Spirit say that
He wanted to speak to me through it. At the time I had no idea what He
wanted to say to me. I had to stop and listen. I read it many times
praying over it, asking Jesus to speak to me. I went for long walks
thinking it over and listening to the Holy Spirit. He taught me many
things and showed me more about Jesus. I wonder if any of you have that
sense of &amp;quot;Yes. Jesus wants to speak to me through this story.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does anyone want to share anything about your encounter with this
story so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine you are one of those who drove Jesus away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I want you to think about the story as if you were one of
those who drove Jesus away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about
him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their
synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he
had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the
synagogue, as was his custom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has come early today to try and get a seat. Look around you.
Here are all your friends and family, that you have grown up with and
know intimately. This is your synagogue, which your parents helped to
build when you were a child. You helped carry the water and mould the
mud bricks. You remember the day when the community held the first
synagogue service here. You feel secure and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today there is much excitement because in recent weeks, your school-mate
Jesus has become the talk of the town and all the towns round about. He
has become a powerful and popular preacher in the district. He is coming
home today and everyone wants to hear all His stories. The Rabbi said it
wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for Jesus to talk about Himself in the service,
so He is just reading the lesson. But we are all staying afterwards to
hear His stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the familiar service gets underway your mind wanders back to your
youth when you and Jesus got up to some fine pranks &amp;ndash; you remember the
night you secretly got into the Rabbi&#39;s house and tied his
prayer-tassels into such a terrible knot that he had to go through the
service the next day with them all tangled. You got into terrible
trouble &amp;ndash; not because of the tangles, but because you did it on the
Sabbath. You had such a laugh. Your attention comes back as Jesus is
asked to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You love the reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed
to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to
proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for
the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the
oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat
down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He
began by saying to them, &amp;ldquo;Today this scripture is fulfilled in your
hearing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came
from his lips. &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this Joseph&amp;rsquo;s son?&amp;rdquo; they asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone looks at Joseph, and you feel a certain pride that you were one
of Jesus&#39; best childhood friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are smiles on everyone&#39;s faces and the service is about to move
onto the prayers and the final blessing. But we never get to the
prayers. The service ends in utter chaos &amp;ndash; worse than that, it ends in
a riot! Just as the Rabbi is about to start the prayers, Jesus speaks
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus deliberately provokes you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Surely you will quote this proverb to me:
&amp;lsquo;Physician, heal yourself!&amp;rsquo; And you will tell me, &amp;lsquo;Do here in your
hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.&amp;rsquo; Truly I tell
you,&amp;rdquo; he continued, &amp;ldquo;no prophet is accepted in his hometown. I assure
you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah&amp;rsquo;s time, when the
sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine
throughout the land. Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a
widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. And there were many in
Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of
them was cleansed&amp;mdash;only Naaman the Syrian.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are taken aback at this. For a start, the Rabbi had said that Jesus
wasn&#39;t to preach, but only to read the lesson. But what a strange way
to carry on. Everyone was happy and smiling until Jesus accused them of
being stiff-necked. That&#39;s what the privileged people up in Jerusalem
say about us northerners. They are always quoting the prophets at us and
telling us how our ancestors filled the land with Baal worshippers. They
love telling the stories of Elijah and Elisha, but they never fail to
point out that our ancestors rejected their message, and that eventually
God sent the Assyrians to make slaves of them. We are stigmatised as
stiff-necked people that reject God&#39;s message. And now, here is Jesus,
one of our own, quoting Elijah and Elisha at us again! Who does he think
he is? Does he think he is better than the rest of us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You drive Jesus away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of
the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the
cliff. But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t have any idea that God has given your old school friend a
message He really wants you to receive; a message to challenge and
change you; to bring you into His Kingdom in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagining yourself to be one of those angry people &amp;ndash; what made you so
angry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you want to drive Jesus away?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compassion for the angry response&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you respond when you are challenged about what you are doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irritated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defensive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen prayerfully!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually challenge-back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who are you to question what I am doing?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What about this thing in your life?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why should I listen to you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What makes you so special that you can challenge me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you want me to listen then show me your results.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you feel when the challenge has been shaken off?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have stood my ground&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have regained control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel secure again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what I am doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what people want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagine Jesus walking into your service and challenging what you are
doing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your response?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to keep reading and meditating on this story and see
what Jesus wants to say to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time we will consider the story from Jesus&#39; perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening-to-jesus-conference----session-4-24oct2020-a-disrupting-visit-from-jesus&#34;&gt;Listening To Jesus conference &amp;ndash; Session 4 (24/Oct/2020) A Disrupting Visit from Jesus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim&lt;/strong&gt;: To become a truly prophetic people who hear and obey our
extraordinary Lord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus lived according to Kingdom culture and that often clashed with his
native culture. We are called to courageously walk in Kingdom culture
where it is contrary to our native culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our first session we reminded ourselves that, like Mary, we must
listen to Jesus and not just busy ourselves with many distractions like
Martha. Likewise discipling others centres on teaching them to listen
to, and obey, Jesus. And our mission is to bring people to Jesus so they
can find rest for their souls in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been looking at Luke 4:14-30 - Jesus visiting his home synagogue
after His baptism. We thought about this story from Joseph&#39;s point of
view and then from the point of view of one of the angry congregation
members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is Jesus saying to you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does anyone want to share anything about your encounter with this
story so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has this story made you think differently about how you listen to
Jesus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine you are Jesus in this story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I want you to think about the story as if you were Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about
him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their
synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he
had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the
synagogue, as was his custom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has come early today to try and get a seat. Look around you.
Here are all your friends and family, that you have grown up with and
know intimately. As the familiar service gets underway the Holy Spirit
starts to speak to you. &amp;quot;These dear people, your friends and family;
they do not know the voice of God. They know He used to speak to the
prophets, but they have no expectation that God would want to speak to
them. They set out years ago to worship me by way of this synagogue
service, but for most of them, most of the time, it has become more of a
religious duty. It serves well in maintaining the social aspect of the
community which I am very glad about. But I have called you to break out
of the safety of the congregation and take the Good News of the Kingdom
out into the hurting world. So plant the seed of My word into their
hearts. And be prepared for a bumpy ride.&amp;quot; Your attention comes back as
you are asked to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They love the reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed
to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to
proclaim good news &lt;strong&gt;to the poor&lt;/strong&gt;. He has sent me to proclaim freedom
&lt;strong&gt;for the prisoners&lt;/strong&gt; and recovery of sight &lt;strong&gt;for the blind&lt;/strong&gt;, to set
&lt;strong&gt;the oppressed&lt;/strong&gt; free, to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat
down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He
began by saying to them, &amp;ldquo;Today this scripture is fulfilled in your
hearing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came
from his lips. &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this Joseph&amp;rsquo;s son?&amp;rdquo; they asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst everyone is smiling and congratulating Joseph on having such a
fine son, the Spriit speaks to you again. &amp;quot;They have dismissed the
reading as a lovely familiar scripture and have no idea that God is
actually announcing its fulfilment. You need to shake them up a bit. Get
them to realise you are speaking for Me. Warn them not to dismiss your
words simply because you are their friend. Remind them about Elijah and
Elisha.&amp;quot; So just as the Rabbi is about to start the prayers, you
interrupt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You deliberately provoke the congregation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Surely you will quote this proverb to me:
&amp;lsquo;Physician, heal yourself!&amp;rsquo; And you will tell me, &amp;lsquo;Do here in your
hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.&amp;rsquo; Truly I tell
you,&amp;rdquo; he continued, &amp;ldquo;no prophet is accepted in his hometown. I assure
you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah&amp;rsquo;s time, when the
sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine
throughout the land. Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a
widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. And there were many in
Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of
them was cleansed&amp;mdash;only Naaman the Syrian.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see the anger in people&#39;s faces and shoot up an arrow prayer, &amp;quot;I
don&#39;t think they liked that! Instead of making them stop and listen,
they are all murmuring and glaring at me.&amp;quot; The Spirit answers, &amp;quot;Yes.
This happy community need a good shaking to get them to stop thinking
about their services and to start thinking about the Kingdom. Many of
them have got so much invested in the synagogue that they have not
stopped to even consider that I might want to change things. But some
will reflect on what has happened today and will seek you out to hear
more. But we aren&#39;t done yet. I&#39;m going to stir up such an angry
outcry that they will not forget this day, and next week&#39;s service will
be completely taken up with heart-searching about what happened today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They drive You away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of
the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the
cliff. But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you walk away you talk to the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What conversation do you think might have taken place between Jesus
and the Father?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, did I mess that up? Was that what you wanted to happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have rejected me. What next? &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Over to you, Holy
Spirit...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I go back and try to explain or reason with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me the courage to press on. Give them the sight to see the
truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don&#39;t know what they are doing. They are rejecting God truth
for the lies of their culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their tradition hardened their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did Jesus provoke them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to ask &amp;quot;Why did Jesus deliberately provoke his congregation?&amp;quot;
Remember that these were the people He knew and loved the best. We need
to look closely at what he read to understand why Jesus provoked them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to
proclaim good news &lt;strong&gt;to the poor&lt;/strong&gt;. He has sent me to proclaim freedom
&lt;strong&gt;for the prisoners&lt;/strong&gt; and recovery of sight &lt;strong&gt;for the blind&lt;/strong&gt;, to set
&lt;strong&gt;the oppressed&lt;/strong&gt; free, to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between this announcement and the normal
synagogue service?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power and presence of Jesus was not in the normal services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service was to benefit the congregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor, the prisoners, the blind and the oppressed were not in the
synagogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was sent to those who didn&#39;t go to church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think Jesus provoked them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had always had the synagogue services. They never even imagined
they should do anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had so much invested in the synagogue and the services they
were resistant to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They needed to discover, by their angry response, that they were
more concerned about their own agenda than what God might want for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many times do you think you have read this story in your whole
life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many of those times have you smiled and said, &amp;quot;That&#39;s
nice!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever thought that Jesus might want to disrupt your life
like He did for this synagogue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever experienced an event that has seriously disrupted your
normal church service?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebola, Covid 19, a storm damaging the building, bulldozers
demolishing your church...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you stop to consider if Jesus had visited you in that event?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What might Jesus be wanting to do or say to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the next week will you set time aside to pray through all we have
been talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask Jesus what He wants to say to you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does His announcement in v18 mean for how you conduct your life
and ministry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What disrupting events have you experienced?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there something Jesus wants to disrupt in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there something Jesus wants to disrupt in your church?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you doing about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next time...Can we share with each other what we think Jesus is
saying to us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening-to-jesus-conference----session-5-31oct2020-are-we-listening&#34;&gt;Listening To Jesus conference &amp;ndash; Session 5 (31/Oct/2020) Are We Listening?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to the Listening To Jesus conference.Aim&lt;/strong&gt;: To become a truly
prophetic people who hear and obey our extraordinary Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is time to put what we have learnt into practice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not planning to teach this morning. It is time for us put what we
have been learning into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please look back over the notes from the previous weeks and really pray
about the passage and the questions I have asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be really honest about your answers and in our sharing next week.
We all struggle to hear Jesus clearly. We are not here to pretend, or to
compare ourselves with others, but to encourage one another and support
and love each other. The Pharisees found it so hard to receive Jesus
because they pretended to be better than they were. That is why it was
the tax collectors and sinners that received Jesus &amp;ndash; they were not
pretending!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we also want to raise your expectations and confidence that Jesus
really does want to speak to us, and it is worthwhile trying to listen.
It grows as we practice and as we encourage one another to make
listening a priority in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What difference has this conference made to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You are worried and upset about many things, but one thing is
needed&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is that &amp;quot;one thing&amp;quot; for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Jesus want you to do about this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your own devotional life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your own Growth Group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your leadership role?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your discipling of others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your church?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;My Sheep Hear My Voice&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you expect to hear Jesus speak to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does He speak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did you last really feel you had heard Jesus speak to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were you obedient?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has this conference helped you to listen to Jesus through scripture in
a deeper way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have you done as a result?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has your attitude to being challenged or criticised changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Disrupting Visit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you got so much invested in a particular form of church that you
cannot risk letting Jesus speak?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does His announcement in v18 mean for how you conduct your life
and ministry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Jesus saying to you now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus went on His Way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus went on his way&lt;/strong&gt; to the surrounding villages and towns, but the
people returned to their synagogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which way are you going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean in practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;matters-arising&#34;&gt;Matters Arising...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;should-we-spend-all-our-time-in-church&#34;&gt;Should we spend all our time in &amp;quot;church&amp;quot;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris raised a very important point about people who say that to be a
&amp;quot;Mary&amp;quot; means you need to spend all your time in church praying and
fasting etc. and that those who are busy in the &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; working for
their living are &amp;quot;Martha&#39;s&amp;quot;. We would completely disagree with this
view. We are not meant to withdraw from the world and spend all our time
in church. We are meant to go out INTO the world and carry the presence
of Jesus with us. For most of us that means ordinary work. For some it
may be in &amp;quot;full-time ministry&amp;quot;. But all of us can get distracted from
what Jesus is saying to us, ESPECIALLY church leaders! We all need to
cultivate the practice of listening to Jesus in all we do to make sure
we are doing what He wants, and not simply what everyone else expects of
us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-we-teach-others-to-listen-to-jesus&#34;&gt;How do we teach others to listen to Jesus?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James made the really helpful point that our job is NOT to tell people
what they should be doing, or tell them what Jesus is saying to them,
but to help them listen to Jesus for themselves so that they are
obedient to Him and not just to us. A very good example of this is
Phillip with the Ethiopian in Acts 8:30-38. The Ethiopian was reading
Isaiah but couldn&#39;t understand it. So Phillip helped him to understand
it for himself. The result was that the Ethiopian said &amp;ldquo;Look, here is
water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?&amp;rdquo; Phillip did not
tell the Ethiopian what to do, he saw for himself. That is our task as
teachers and disciple-makers; to help people understand what Jesus is
saying so that they can hear and respond for themselves. It is NOT for
us to tell people what Jesus is saying to them or how they should
respond. That is the Holy Spirit&#39;s task.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Missional Communities - Quick Start Guide</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/missional-communities/missional-communities-quick-start-guide/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/missional-communities/missional-communities-quick-start-guide/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;missional-communities----quick-start-guide&#34;&gt;Missional Communities &amp;ndash; Quick-Start Guide&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missional Communities are how we obey the command to &amp;quot;meet together to
encourage one another to love and good deeds&amp;quot; (Hebrews 10:24-25).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once you have established some Growth Groups the next step is to make
each member of the group the centre of a Missional Community. This is
really easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit your immediate neighbors and explain that you would like to
gather a few neighbors together to share a meal and get to know them
better and talk about how they can improve things for the community.
If one of the neighbors offers to host the meal, accept the offer,
otherwise host the meal yourself (they don&#39;t have to be believers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you gather for the meal, ask them if you can give thanks to God
for the food. Give thanks for Jesus giving His life for us by
allowing Himself to be unjustly killed and then rising from the dead
to be the King over all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain that you want to give each person a portion of food and a
drink of water and that it represents Jesus&#39; body and blood that He
gave so we can have Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then enjoy your meal together and talk about your community.
Encourage people to be thankful for the good things and to think
about what they can do to help where there are bad things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meal, encourage people (including unbelievers) to talk
about how they think God may be working in their own lives. Ask them
what they can do to cooperate with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell them about Growth Groups and share a gospel story and discuss
it together. Afterwards offer to help them start a GG in their own
home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss and plan any specific action you can take together to help
your community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan your next meal together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missional Communities should be for all Christians and their neighbors,
regardless of what church they go to, or if they don&#39;t go to church at
all. You should especially try to include any troublesome families,
because the Gospel message is for the broken, the sick, the captives and
those who are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have Growth Groups and Missional Communities, you have the keys
to reaching whole communities with the Gospel and reaching out into the
communities all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that Missional Communities work best when there are less than
40 people involved, so create lots of small Missional Communities. If
more people want to join in, then simply start a new one. The whole
point is to reach out, rather than gather in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mentality of traditional church is to gather, gather, gather. They
think that the more you gather the more successful you are. Our
mentality is to go, go, go. Reach out. Create new Growth Groups, new
Missional Communities, go to new villages. If people want to gather, we
MUST RESIST! Instead encourage them to gather in their own community and
start their own GG&#39;s and Missional Communities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Missional Communities - Vision</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/missional-communities/missional-communities-vision/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/missional-communities/missional-communities-vision/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;seeking-first-the-kingdom---what-should-the-church-to-look-like&#34;&gt;Seeking First the Kingdom - what should the church to look like?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years I have been saying that Jesus never told us to run
churches, but to love one another and go and make disciples. In Jesus&#39;
ministry and that of the early church, both of these commands were
worked out in deeply relational community. As a consequence we have been
promoting Growth Groups as a very effective means of loving and making
disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now want to address a fundamental question: what did Jesus intend the
church to look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church is depicted by Paul as the Body of Christ &amp;ndash; each part joined
in love and functioning in relation to the whole to embody Jesus in our
communities (1 Cor 12). But generations of church practices have
entrenched &amp;quot;church&amp;quot; as a producer / consumer relationship between the
leaders and the congregation. In addition our consumer society has
encouraged people to view church as a service-provider resulting in
pick-and-choose and take-it-or-leave-it attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevance of the church has also been curtailed by reducing the
Gospel to the Cross instead of preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom that
Jesus told us to proclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubling-traditions&#34;&gt;Troubling Traditions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in
order to observe your own traditions!&amp;rdquo; Mark 7:9. We are often blind to
our own traditions and jump to defend them when challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many styles of church have been tried, including house church, Cell
Church, Alternative Worship, Seeker-Friendly, concert-style, night-club
style, Messy Church, Café Church and more. Each of these has started
with the concept of a worship service and tried to find more culturally
relevant ways of doing worship in the hope that non-Christians might be
persuaded to come and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even Christians struggle with church! In recent weeks I have had
Christians from three different generations tell me that church is not
working for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have we simply been following the traditions of men? Who said that a
church gathering should be a worship service? What would happen if we
allowed ourselves to completely reimagine church from the start? That is
extremely difficult because the word &amp;quot;church&amp;quot; has generations of
meaning behind it. So let&#39;s not even talk about church. Let&#39;s ban that
word for the sake of this exercise, and instead let&#39;s talk about
Missional Communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;missional-communities&#34;&gt;Missional Communities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already established our starting point in two important
discoveries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus never told us to run church services; He sent us to make
obedient disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel Jesus preached was depicted by His life, not His death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we come to the Gospels to learn from Jesus about what a Missional
Community might look like, we are struck by the observation that God the
Father is the Great Missionary. This is not a story of men finding God,
but of God seeking and drawing men to Himself. The whole bible proclaims
this from cover to cover. That shows us that a Missional Community sees
God and the world differently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is seen as the Missional God, reaching into our communities in
manifold ways to set them free in His Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission, therefore, is to help our friends recognize how God is
at work in their lives and to help them cooperate with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if God is the Missionary and our role is to &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; what God is
doing, how do we do that? Jesus makes this very clear: live a Kingdom
life and proclaim the presence of the Kingdom. In other words, love one
another &amp;ndash; and love those who do not yet know Jesus &amp;ndash; and invite them
to share in God&#39;s kingdom too. Therefore a Missional Community sees
themselves differently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starting point is the formation of a culturally appropriate
community, rather than a &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt;. Sharing all of our lives in
transparent honesty is our act of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to transform our society through demonstrating the
Kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gathering-round-a-breaking-bread-meal&#34;&gt;Gathering round a Breaking Bread Meal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not too difficult to create small communities &amp;ndash; our wider
communities probably have many already. In our village we have groups
for craft, singing, running, walking, dancing, photography, book-swap,
reading, cinema, football ... the list goes on. Some of these groups
are run by churches or individual Christians. But how do we create a
Missional Community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that centring a Missional Community around the Breaking of Bread
is important for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus commanded it at the Last Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a remembrance of His death it reminds us that God is the Father,
sending His Son to us. And as the Father reached out to us in Jesus,
so we also are to be an outward reaching community. Through us God
reaches out to others in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a proper meal, rather than a token meal, it emphasises to us that
we need to feed on Him, just like we feed on the bread. We must eat
and drink Him so He lives in and through us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meal has a past, present and future aspect. It looks back to the
Cross; celebrates His presence with us now; and looks forward to the
fullness of the Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here is a most important point that we tend to miss. Jesus said he
would not eat again with his disciples until the Kingdom had come (Luke
22:18). And yet after the resurrection Jesus is recorded as eating again
and again with his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was making the point that the Kingdom has now come. Our meal is
therefore about the presence of the Kingdom. We live out the Kingdom and
invite others to take part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although traditionally the Breaking of Bread has been restricted to
believers, there is no suggestion in the Gospels or the letters that the
church should close its doors to unbelievers when sharing this meal.
Indeed, the early church viewed the Breaking of Bread as central to
mission. in In 362AD Julian II, Emperor of Rome, wrote this about the
Christians: &amp;quot;These impious Galileans not only feed their own poor,
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;but ours also&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; welcoming them into their agapae (their Breaking
Bread meal), they attract them, as children are attracted, with cakes.&amp;quot;
Pagans were invited to share in the Breaking of Bread meals and thereby
came to faith. The agapae meal was a celebration &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and demonstration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
of God reaching out to a broken world in Jesus and through His death
establishing the means of forgiveness and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple churches around the world have proved how effective a shared meal
is at creating community with not-yet-believers and make it an essential
part of their gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-it-look-like&#34;&gt;What does it look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we start with the Jesus-ordained ingredient of the Breaking Bread
meal, what else can we say about a Missional Community? Well I think we
can agree it needs to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoyable to the extent that people are enthusiastic about inviting
others to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus centred so that conversations about Jesus are easy to
initiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-denominational, non-threatening and non-churchy as far as
people&#39;s pre-conceptions are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grow organically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, we will only discover what a Missional Community looks like
by starting one. This is our suggested starting point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build community around sharing a simple breaking-bread meal followed
by optional small-group activities (see later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a minimal liturgical structure sufficient to make it clear what
the meal represents to believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encourage all to take part in short small-group discussion of a
short passage of scripture before the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid unnecessary religious elements, such as singing and preaching
and pretence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-it-might-become&#34;&gt;What it Might Become&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have many different small missional communities in a community,
each serving different demographic needs. They might meet once or twice
a month &amp;ndash; or more often - (not necessarily on a Sunday) in homes or
public places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be a mix of Christian and not yet Christian people. During
the breaking-bread meal people would be sharing their news and also
their concerns and needs. After the meal, several small groups could
form to take things deeper. Possible small groups might include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Parenting Course&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Growth Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer for healing or some other specific need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help with budgeting or managing debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions about the Bible or Christianity that people are struggling
with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical help or advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning and singing worship songs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-{=html}&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- --&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agnostics / Atheists discussion group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-our-existing-congregations&#34;&gt;What about our Existing Congregations?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Missional Communities prove to be effective then we must give them
priority over &amp;quot;normal church&amp;quot; and they must become our new &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;.
We will probably want to find ways of gathering missional communities
together from time to time, as Jesus leads &amp;ndash; but not to build up our
own kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-kingdom-of-god-in-community&#34;&gt;The Kingdom of God in Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missional communities reject the producer / consumer view of church and
embrace the call to live as a family joined in Christ. This family is
where the Kingdom is expressed most clearly as family support is offered
and relationship issues worked out rather than being ignored. The
success of a Missional Community depends upon strong and transparent
loving relationships. The real focus is on the relationships rather than
the gatherings; gatherings support relationship, not the other way
round. But Missional Communities are not inward-focussed; their
community extends to their non-Christian friends and seeks to include
them. Indeed, for some Christians in the community, their deepest and
most transparent relationships might be with non-Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the central importance of relationships, the maximum size of
a Missional Community is typically around 40 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-does-church-look-like&#34;&gt;So what does &amp;quot;church&amp;quot; look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church is a Kingdom-centred way of life, not a meeting. It is a body
functioning with Jesus as the head. It&#39;s leadership and direction
depends upon listening to and hearing Jesus, not following our program.
It is loving and supporting and disciple-making. It is salt and light in
its wider community. It is God&#39;s Kingdom evident on earth. It&#39;s a
place where Jesus would go un-noticed because there are so many doing
what Jesus does; a place where Jesus would want to be as a participant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Perspectives on Paul</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New Perspectives on Paul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivered at the Tenth Edinburgh Dogmatics Conference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Introduction]{.ul}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for the invitation to this conference, and for the
sensitive way in which the organisers responded to my comments on the
initial outline of the programme. I am aware that fresh interpretations
of Paul, including my own, have caused controversy in evangelical
circles, and particularly reformed circles. My own name has been linked
with proposals which have been variously dismissed, scorned, vilified
and anathematized. Having heard the papers yesterday morning and
afternoon I suggested to David Searle that I should take two hours not
one to say what needs to be said just now; but when I heard Tony Lane
last night I realised I would need, like Cardinal Seripando at Trent,
two days to establish my own orthodoxy. We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several different agendas coming together at this point. The
issue is sometimes treated as a variation on old modernist
controversies, at other times as a clash between a Christian absolutism
and a religious relativism, and at other times as a variation on a
perceived protestant/catholic divide (or even a high-church/low-church
divide), with the so-called new perspective focussing on ecclesiology
rather than soteriology and being condemned for so doing. And that&amp;rsquo;s
just the beginning. From time to time correspondents draw my attention
to various websites on which you can find scathing denunciations of me
for abandoning traditional protestant orthodoxy and puzzled rejoinders
from people who have studied my work and know that I&amp;rsquo;m not saying what
many of my critics say I&amp;rsquo;m saying. Go to amazon.com and look at the
comments which anonymous correspondents have appended to some of my
books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with that kind of problem, it would take a whole book to unpick
the strands, to disentangle them from other issues, to explain what the
so-called New Perspective is and isn&amp;rsquo;t, and to argue exegetically step
by step for a particular reading of Paul. Clearly I can&amp;rsquo;t do that here.
What I shall do instead is to make two opening remarks about my aim and
method on the one hand and the problem of the New Perspective on the
other, and then to attempt once more to say briefly what I think needs
to be said about Paul and justification, sharpening up the issues here
and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, as to aim and method. When I began research on Paul, thirty years
ago this autumn, my aim was to understand Paul in general and Romans in
particular better than I had done before, as part of my heartfelt and
lifelong commitment to scripture, and to the &lt;em&gt;sola scriptura&lt;/em&gt; principle,
believing that the better the church understands and lives by scripture
the better its worship, preaching and common life will be. I was
conscious of thereby standing methodologically in the tradition of the
reformers, for whom exegesis was the lifeblood of the church, and who
believed that scripture should stand over against all human traditions.
I have not changed this aim and this method, nor do I intend to. Indeed,
the present controversy, from my own point of view, often appears to me
in terms of a battle for the Reformers&#39; &lt;em&gt;aims and methods&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; going back
to scripture over against all human tradition &amp;ndash; against some of their
theological positions (and, equally, those of their opponents, since I
believe that often both sides were operating with mistaken
understandings of Paul). I believe that Luther, Calvin, and many of the
others would tell us to read scripture afresh, with all the tools
available to us &amp;ndash; which is after all what they did &amp;ndash; and to treat
their own doctrinal conclusions as important but not as important as
scripture itself. That is what I have tried to do, and I believe I am
honouring them thereby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me, if you will, a moment of autobiography, for reasons similar to
those of Paul in Galatians 1 and 2. In my early days of research, before
Sanders had published &lt;em&gt;Paul and Palestinian Judaism&lt;/em&gt; in 1977 and long
before Dunn coined the phrase &amp;lsquo;The New Perspective on Paul&amp;rsquo;, I was
puzzled by one exegetical issue in particular, which I here oversimplify
for the sake of summary. If I read Paul in the then standard Lutheran
way, Galatians made plenty of sense, but I had to fudge (as I could see
dozens of writers fudging) the positive statements about the Law in
Romans. If I read Paul in the Reformed way of which, for me, Charles
Cranfield remains the supreme exegetical exemplar, Romans made a lot of
sense, but I had to fudge (as I could see Cranfield fudging) the
negative statements about the Law in Galatians. For me then and now, if
I had to choose between Luther and Calvin I would always take Calvin,
whether on the Law or (for that matter) the Eucharist. But as I
struggled this way and that with the Greek text of Romans and Galatians,
it dawned on me, I think in 1976, that a different solution was
possible. In Romans 10.3 Paul, writing about his fellow Jews, declares
that they are ignorant of the righteousness of God, and are seeking to
establish &amp;lsquo;their own righteousness&amp;rsquo;. The wider context, not least
9.30&amp;ndash;33, deals with the respective positions of Jews and Gentiles
within God&amp;rsquo;s purposes &amp;ndash; and with a lot more besides, of course, but not
least that. Supposing, I thought, Paul meant &amp;lsquo;seeking to
establish &lt;em&gt;their own&lt;/em&gt; righteousness&amp;rsquo;, not in the sense of
a&lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; status based on the &lt;em&gt;performance&lt;/em&gt; of Torah and the consequent
accumulation of a treasury of merit, but an &lt;em&gt;ethnic&lt;/em&gt; status based on
the &lt;em&gt;possession&lt;/em&gt; of Torah as the sign of automatic covenant membership?
I saw at once that this would make excellent sense of Romans 9 and 10,
and would enable the positive statements about the Law throughout Romans
to be given full weight while making it clear that this kind of use of
Torah, as an ethnic talisman, was an abuse. I sat up in bed that night
reading through Galatians and saw that at point after point this way of
looking at Paul would make much better sense of Galatians, too, than
either the standard post-Luther readings or the attempted Reformed ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I&amp;rsquo;m telling you this is to show that I came to the position I
still hold (having found it over the years to be deeply rewarding
exegetically right across Paul; I regard as absolutely basic the need to
understand Paul in a way which does justice to all the letters, as well
as to the key passages in individual ones) &amp;ndash; that I came to this
position, not because I learned it from Sanders or Dunn, but because of
the struggle to think Paul&amp;rsquo;s thoughts after him as a matter of obedience
to scripture. This brings me to the complexity of the so-called New
Perspective and of my relationship to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Sanders&amp;rsquo;s book was published in 1977, I devoured it with both
eagerness and puzzlement. Eagerness, because his exposition of
first-century Palestinian Judaism supported in all kinds of ways the
picture to which I had been coming through my reading of Paul (I was
not, then, well up in Judaism itself). Puzzlement, because when he came
to Paul Sanders seemed muddled and imprecise. This is partly, I now
realise, because he was not dealing with theology (and so seemed
confused about basic things like justification and salvation), but
rather with religion, and patterns of religion in particular. His
agenda, there and elsewhere, included a desire to make Christianity and
Judaism less antithetical; in other words, to take a large step away
from the anti-Judaism of much Pauline scholarship. I need hardly say
that I never embraced either Sanders&amp;rsquo;s picture of Paul or the
relativistic agendas which seemed to be driving it. Indeed, for the next
decade much of what I wrote on Paul was in debate and disagreement with
Sanders, not least because his proposals lacked the exegetical clarity
and rootedness which I regarded and regard as indispensible. For me, the
question has always been &amp;lsquo;But does this make sense of the text?&amp;rsquo;, not
&amp;lsquo;But will this fit into some abstract scheme somewhere?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of those who joined the Sanders bandwaggon, not least in America,
did so because they shared his post-Holocaust re-evaluation of
Christian-Jewish relations, and the implicit relativism which that
engendered. I have spent considerable energy arguing against this
position, and explaining that Paul&amp;rsquo;s critique of Israel is not based on,
or productive of, anti-Judaism as such, still less anti-semitism, but
involves a far more delicately balanced and nuanced theology which
cannot be reduced to such slogans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, when Jimmy Dunn added his stones to the growing pile I found
myself in both agreement and disagreement with him. His proposal about
the meaning of &amp;lsquo;works of the law&amp;rsquo; in Paul &amp;ndash; that they are not the moral
works through which one gains merit but the works through which the Jew
is defined over against the pagan &amp;ndash; I regard as exactly right. It has
proved itself again and again in the detailed exegesis; attempts to deny
it have in my view failed. But Dunn, like Sanders (and like some other
New Perspetive writers such as John Ziesler) has not, I think, got to
the heart of Paul. Again, much of my writing on Paul over the last
twenty years at least has been in at least implicit dialogue with him,
and I find his exposition of justification itself less than satisfying.
For one thing, he never understands what I take to be Paul&amp;rsquo;s fundamental
covenant theology; for another, his typically protestant
anti-sacramentalism leads him to miss the point of Romans 6. I could go
on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say all this to make it clear that there are probably almost as many
&amp;lsquo;New Perspective&amp;rsquo; positions as there are writers espousing it &amp;ndash; and
that I disagree with most of them. Where I agree is as follows. It is
blindingly obvious when you read Romans and Galatians &amp;ndash; though you
would never have known this from any of the theologians we discussed
yesterday &amp;ndash; that virtually whenever Paul talks about justification he
does so in the context of a critique of Judaism and of the coming
together of Jew and Gentile in Christ. As an exegete determined to
listen to scripture rather than abstract my favourite bits from it I
cannot ignore this. The only notice that most mainstream theology has
taken of this context is to assume that the Jews were guilty of the kind
of works-righteousness of which theologians from Augustine to Calvin and
beyond have criticised their opponents; and, though Sanders&amp;rsquo;s account of
Judaism needs a lot more nuancing, I regard the New Perspective&amp;rsquo;s
challenge to this point as more or less established. What I miss
entirely in the Old Perspective, but find so powerfully in some modern
Pauline scholarship, is Paul&amp;rsquo;s sense of an underlying narrative, the
story of God and Israel, God and Abraham, God and the covenant people,
and the way in which that story came to its climax, as he says, &amp;lsquo;when
the time had fully come&amp;rsquo; with the coming of Jesus the Messiah. How all
this works out is still very controversial within the New Perspective.
But at these points, for good exegetical and historical reasons, I find
myself saying Here I Stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has happened, then? Like America looking for a new scapegoat after
the collapse of the Cold War, and seizing on the Islamic world as the
obvious target, many conservative writers, having discovered themselves
in possession of the Pauline field after the liberals got tired of it,
have looked around for new enemies. Here is something called the New
Perspective; it seems to be denying some of the things we have normally
taught; very well, let us demonize it, lump its proponents together, and
nuke them from a great height. That has not made a pretty sight.
Speaking as one of those who is regularly thus carpet-bombed, what I
find frustrating is the refusal of the traditionalists to do three
things: first, to differentiate the quite separate types of New
Perspective; second, to engage in the actual exegetical debates upon
which the whole thing turns, instead of simply repeating a Lutheran or
similar line as though that settled matters; and third, to recognise
that some of us at least are brothers in Christ who have come to the
positions we hold not because of some liberal, modernist or relativist
agenda but as a result of prayerful and humble study of the text which
is and remains our sole authority. Of course, prayer and humility before
the text do not guarantee exegetical success. We all remain deeply
flawed at all levels. But that is precisely my point. If I am &lt;em&gt;simul
iustus et peccator&lt;/em&gt;, the church, not least the church as the
scripture-reading community, must be &lt;em&gt;ecclesia catholica semper
reformanda&lt;/em&gt;. Like Calvin, we must claim the right to stand critically
within a tradition. To deny either of these would be to take a large
step towards precisely the kind of triumphalism against which the
Reformers themselves would severely warn us. But if we are siblings in
Christ there are, I think, appropriate ways of addressing one another
and of speaking about one another, and I regret that these have not
always characterized the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much more that I could say under both these initial headings,
but this must suffice for now. I turn to what I regard as the central
issues around which the debate ought to turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Understanding Righteousness in Paul: The Central Issues]{.ul}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me, as a good Calvinist, offer you five points about Paul which I
regard as crucial in the present debates, justification itself being the
fifth. There are of course many other things vital to Paul, not least
Christology, about which I have written much; all of these need careful
integration into the picture, for which now is not the time. Ideally,
one would walk slowly round the piece of the Pauline jigsaw labelled
&amp;lsquo;justification&amp;rsquo;, commenting on each other piece of the jigsaw and noting
how justification fits into it. Obvious examples, each of which is dear
to my heart and most of which I have written about elsewhere, are the
cross, the resurrection, the spirit, the Jewish law, union with Christ,
the sacraments, election, and love. Please do not think that because
there is no time to expound any of these I am forgetting or
marginalising them. And, again because of time, I simply state each
point in the barest outline, relying on my other works, not least my
recent Romans commentary, to back me up with details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The Gospel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begin where Romans begins &amp;ndash; with the gospel. My proposal is this.
When Paul refers to &amp;lsquo;the gospel&amp;rsquo;, he is not referring to a system of
salvation, though of course the gospel implies and contains this, nor
even to the good news that there now &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a way of salvation open to
all, but rather to the proclamation that the crucified Jesus of Nazareth
has been raised from the dead and thereby demonstrated to be both
Israel&amp;rsquo;s Messiah and the world&amp;rsquo;s true Lord. &amp;lsquo;The gospel&amp;rsquo; is not &amp;lsquo;you can
be saved, and here&amp;rsquo;s how&amp;rsquo;; the gospel, for Paul, is &amp;lsquo;Jesus Christ is
Lord&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This announcement draws together two things, in derivation and
confrontation. First, Paul is clearly echoing the language of Isaiah:
the message announced by the herald in Isaiah 40 and 52 has at last
arrived. Saying &amp;lsquo;Jesus is Messiah and Lord&amp;rsquo; is thus a way of saying,
among other things, &amp;lsquo;Israel&amp;rsquo;s history has come to its climax&amp;rsquo;; or
&amp;lsquo;Isaiah&amp;rsquo;s prophecy has come true at last&amp;rsquo;. This is powerfully reinforced
by Paul&amp;rsquo;s insistence, exactly as in Isaiah, that this heraldic message
reveals God&amp;rsquo;s righteousness, that is, God&amp;rsquo;s covenant faithfulness, about
which more anon. Second, since the word &amp;lsquo;gospel&amp;rsquo; was in public use to
designate the message that Caesar was the Lord of the whole world,
Paul&amp;rsquo;s message could not escape being confrontative: Jesus, not Caesar,
is Lord, and at his name, not that of the Emperor, every knee shall bow.
This aspect lies at the heart of what I have called &amp;lsquo;the fresh
perspective on Paul&amp;rsquo;, the discovery of a subversive political dimension
not as an add-on to Paul&amp;rsquo;s theology but as part of the inner meaning of
&amp;lsquo;gospel&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;righteousness&amp;rsquo;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Paul, the announcement or proclamation of Jesus as Lord was itself
the &amp;lsquo;word of God&amp;rsquo; which carried power. Putting together the various
things he says about the preaching of the gospel, the word, and the work
of the Spirit, we arrive at the following position: when Paul comes into
a town and declares that Jesus is Lord, no doubt explaining who Jesus
was, the fact and significance of his death and resurrection, and so on,
then the Spirit is at work, mysteriously, in the hearts and minds of the
listeners, so that, when some of them believe in Jesus, Paul knows that
this is not because of his eloquence or clever argument but because the
announcement of Jesus as Lord functions as (in later technical language)
the means of grace, the vehicle of the Spirit. And, since the gospel is
the heraldic proclamation of Jesus as Lord, it is not first and foremost
a suggestion that one might like to enjoy a new religious experience.
Nor is it even the take-it-or-leave-it offer of a way to salvation. It
is a royal summons to submission, to obedience, to allegiance; and the
form that this submission and obedient allegiance takes is of course
faith. That is what Paul means by &amp;lsquo;the obedience of faith&amp;rsquo;. Faith
itself, defined conveniently by Paul as belief that Jesus is Lord and
that God raised him from the dead, is the work of the Spirit,
accomplished through the proclamation. &amp;lsquo;No-one can say &amp;ldquo;Jesus is Lord&amp;rdquo;
except by the Holy Spirit.&amp;rsquo; But this already jumps ahead to my fourth
point, and before we get there we must take in the second and third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Righteousness of God&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point concerns the phrase &amp;lsquo;the righteousness of
God&amp;rsquo;, &lt;em&gt;dikaiosune theou&lt;/em&gt;. I became convinced many years ago, and time
and exegesis have confirmed this again and again, that Paul always uses
this phrase to denote, not the status which God&amp;rsquo;s people have from him
or in his presence, but the righteousness of God himself. This is not to
say that there is no such thing as a righteous status held by believers.
There is. It is to deny that this is the referent of Paul&amp;rsquo;s
phrase &lt;em&gt;dikaiosune theou&lt;/em&gt;. Here a Pauline exegesis rooted in Paul&amp;rsquo;s own
understanding of Jewish scripture and tradition must challenge the fuzzy
thinking that, listening to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s papers, I discover characterised
most of the great, but basically Latin-speaking, theologians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main argument for taking &lt;em&gt;dikaiosune theou&lt;/em&gt; to denote an aspect of
the character of God himself is the way in which Paul is summoning up a
massive biblical and intertestamental theme, found not least in Isaiah
40&amp;mdash;55 which I have argued elsewhere is vital for him.
God&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;dikaiosune&lt;/em&gt;, his &lt;em&gt;tsedaqah&lt;/em&gt;, is that aspect of his character
because of which, despite Israel&amp;rsquo;s infidelity and consequent banishment,
God will remain true to the covenant with Abraham and rescue her none
the less. This &amp;lsquo;righteousness&amp;rsquo; is of course a form of justice; God has
bound himself to the covenant, or perhaps we should say God&amp;rsquo;s covenant
is binding upon him, and through this covenant he has promised not only
to save Israel but also, thereby, to renew creation itself. The final
flourish of Isaiah 55 is not to be forgotten, especially when we come to
Romans 8. Righteousness, please note, is not the same thing as
salvation; God&amp;rsquo;s righteousness is the &lt;em&gt;reason why&lt;/em&gt; he saves Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this covenant-fidelity, this covenant-justice, is not purely a
matter of salvific activity. As Daniel 9 makes clear, it is a matter of
God&amp;rsquo;s severe justice upon covenant-breaking Israel, and only then a
matter of God&amp;rsquo;s merciful rescue of penitent Israel. This is why the
gospel &amp;ndash; the announcement that Jesus Christ is Lord &amp;ndash; contains within
itself, as Paul insists in Romans 2.16, the message of future judgment
as well as the news of salvation. What God&amp;rsquo;s righteousness never
becomes, in the Jewish background which Paul is so richly summing up, is
an attribute which is passed on to, reckoned to, or imputed to, his
people. Nor does Paul treat it in this way. What we find, rather, is
that Paul is constantly (especially in Romans, where all but one of the
occurrences of the phrase are found) dealing with the themes which from
Isaiah to 4 Ezra cluster together with the question of God&amp;rsquo;s
righteousness: how is God to be faithful to Israel, to Abraham, to the
world? How will the covenant be fulfilled, and who will be discovered to
be God&amp;rsquo;s covenant people when this happens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely what Romans 9&amp;ndash;11 is about, not as an appendix to the
letter but as its proper climax. And this is anticipated in several
earlier parts of the letter conveniently screened out by the great
tradition in its quest for a non-Jewish soteriology, not least the
second half of Romans 2, the first nine verses of Romans 3, and the fact
that in Romans 4 Paul is demonstrably arguing about God&amp;rsquo;s faithfulness
to the Abrahamic covenant, not simply using Abraham as an example of
someone justified by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the tragedy of reformation exegesis, not least Lutheran
exegesis, is that this entire line of thought was screened out. Thus
even Käsemann, who sees clearly that &lt;em&gt;dikaiosune theou&lt;/em&gt; must refer to
God&amp;rsquo;s own righteousness, cannot allow that it has anything to do with
the covenant, but insists, against the evidence, that it has become a
technical term denoting &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo;s salvation-creating power&amp;rsquo;, with a cosmic
reach. He fails to notice a point I have come to regard as central and
crucial: that the covenant with Israel was always designed to be God&amp;rsquo;s
means of saving and blessing the entire cosmos. You get the cosmic
reach, as in Genesis 12, as in Isaiah 40&amp;mdash;55, as in the Psalms, as in
Romans 8, as in 1 Corinthians 15, not by bypassing the covenant but by
fulfilling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then can we say about the status of &amp;lsquo;righteous&amp;rsquo; which, in many
Pauline passages, is enjoyed by the people of God in Christ? For Paul,
there is a clear distinction. God&amp;rsquo;s own righteousness is &lt;em&gt;dikaiosune
theou&lt;/em&gt;. The status of &amp;lsquo;righteous&amp;rsquo; which people enjoy as a result of
God&amp;rsquo;s action in Christ and by the Spirit is, in Philippians 3.9, &lt;em&gt;he ek
theou dikaiosune&lt;/em&gt;, the righteous status which is &amp;lsquo;from God&amp;rsquo;. Ignoring
this distinction, and translating &lt;em&gt;dikaiosune theou&lt;/em&gt; as &amp;lsquo;a righteousness
from God&amp;rsquo; or something like that, makes nonsense of several passages,
most noticebly Romans 3.21&amp;ndash;26 (as, for instance, in the appalling and
self-contradictory NIV!), where the great theme is the way in which God
has been faithful to the covenant, the astonishing way whereby all
alike, Jewish sinners and Gentile sinners, are welcomed, redeemed,
justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see this most clearly if you remember the context of the Jewish
lawcourt which forms the background for Paul&amp;rsquo;s forensic use of
the &lt;em&gt;dikaiosune&lt;/em&gt; theme. Despite some odd recent attempts to deny this,
if you want to understand forensic justification you must go to the
law-court and find how the metaphor works. In the Jewish lawcourt Paul
would have known, there is no Director of Public Prosecutions; there is
a judge, with a plaintiff and a defendant appearing before him. When the
case has been heard, the judge finds in favour of one party and against
the other. Once that has happened, the vindicated party possesses the
status &amp;lsquo;righteous&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; not itself a moral statement, we note, but a
statement of how things stand in terms of the now completed lawsuit. As
someone said to me yesterday, it all depends what you mean by
&amp;lsquo;righteous&amp;rsquo;. But this status of righteousness has nothing to do with the
righteousness of the judge. For the judge to be righteous, it is
necessary that he try the case fairly, refuse bribes or other
favouritism, uphold the law, and take special note for the helpless, the
widows, and so on. When either the plaintiff or the defendant is
declared &amp;lsquo;righteous&amp;rsquo; at the end of the case, there is no sense that in
either case the judge&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; righteousness has been passed on to them,
by imputation, impartation, or any other process. What they have is a
status of &amp;lsquo;righteous&amp;rsquo; which comes &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the judge. Let me stress, in
particular, that when the judge finds in favour of one party or the
other, he quite literally makes the righteous; because &amp;lsquo;righteous&amp;rsquo; at
this point is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a word denoting moral character, but only and
precisely the status that you have when the court has found in your
favour. If this had been kept in mind in earlier centuries a great deal
of heartache and puzzle might have been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then about the &amp;lsquo;imputed righteousness&amp;rsquo; about which we are to hear
an entire paper this afternoon? This is fine as it stands; God does
indeed &amp;lsquo;reckon righteousness&amp;rsquo; to those who believe. But this is not, for
Paul, the righteousness either of God or of Christ, except in a very
specialised sense to which I shall return. There are only two passages
which can be invoked in favour of the imputed righteousness being that
of God or Christ. The first proves too much, and the second not enough.
The first is 1 Corinthians 1.30f., where Paul says that Christ has
become for us wisdom from God, and righteousness, sanctification and
redemption. Wisdom is the main point he is making, and the other three
nouns come in as a way of saying &amp;lsquo;and everything else as well&amp;rsquo;. &amp;lsquo;Yea,
all I need, in thee to find, O Lamb of God, I come&amp;rsquo;; that line sums it
up well. I doubt if this will sustain the normal &amp;lsquo;imputation&amp;rsquo; theology,
because it would seem to demand equal air time for the imputation of
wisdom, sanctification and redemption as well. The second passage is 2
Corinthians 5.21, which as I have argued elsewhere is not, as a matter
of good exegesis, a statement of soteriology but of apostolic vocation.
The entire passage is about the way in which Paul&amp;rsquo;s new covenant
ministry, through the death and resurrection of Jesus, is in fact God&amp;rsquo;s
appointed means for establishing and maintaining the church. &amp;lsquo;So that we
might become God&amp;rsquo;s righteousness in him&amp;rsquo; means that in Christ those who
are called to be apostolic preachers actually embody God&amp;rsquo;s own covenant
faithfulness. I do not expect to convince you by this microcomsic
summary of the point, but I submit that it deserves careful exegetical
consideration, not dismissing with a wave of the hand and a reference to
Brother Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there then no &amp;lsquo;reckoning of righteousness&amp;rsquo; in, for instance, Romans
5.14&amp;ndash;21? Yes, there is; but my case is that this is not God&amp;rsquo;s own
righteousness, or Christ&amp;rsquo;s own righteousness, that is reckoned to God&amp;rsquo;s
redeemed people, but rather the fresh status of &amp;lsquo;covenant member&amp;rsquo;,
and/or &amp;lsquo;justified sinner&amp;rsquo;, which is accredited to those who are in
Christ, who have heard the gospel and responded with &amp;lsquo;the obedience of
faith&amp;rsquo;. But this, too, is pushing towards my fifth point, and I must
proceed with the third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Final Judgment According to Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third point is remarkably controversial, seeing how well founded it
is at several points in Paul. Indeed, listening to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s papers,
it seems that there has been a massive conspiracy of silence on
something which was quite clear for Paul (as indeed for Jesus). Paul, in
company with mainstream second-Temple Judaism, affirms that God&amp;rsquo;s final
judgment will be in accordance with the entirety of a life led &amp;ndash; in
accordance, in other words, with works. He says this clearly and
unambiguously in Romans 14.10&amp;ndash;12 and 2 Corinthians 5.10. He affirms it
in that terrifying passage about church-builders in 1 Corinthians 3. But
the main passage in question is of course Romans 2.1&amp;ndash;16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage has often been read differently. We heard yesterday that
Augustine had problems with it (perhaps the only thing in common between
Augustine and E. P. Sanders). That is hardly surprising; here is the
first statement about justification in Romans, and lo and behold it
affirms justification according to works! The doers of the law, he says,
will be justified (2.13). Shock, horror; Paul cannot (so many have
thought) have really meant it. So the passage has been treated as a
hypothetical position which Paul then undermines by showing that nobody
can actually achieve it; or, by Sanders for instance, as a piece of
unassimilated Jewish preaching which Paul allows to stand even though it
conflicts with other things he says. But all such theories are
undermined by exegesis itself, not least by observing the many small but
significant threads that stitch Romans 2 into the fabric of the letter
as a whole. Paul means what he says. Granted, he redefines what &amp;lsquo;doing
the law&amp;rsquo; really means; he does this in chapter 8, and again in chapter
10, with a codicil in chapter 13. But he makes the point most compactly
in Philippians 1.6: he who began a good work in you will bring it to
completion on the day of Christ Jesus. The &amp;lsquo;works&amp;rsquo; in accordance with
which the Christian will be vindicated on the last day are not the
unaided works of the self-help moralist. Nor are they the performance of
the ethnically distinctive Jewish boundary-markers (sabbath, food-laws
and circumcision). They are the things which show, rather, that one is
in Christ; the things which are produced in one&amp;rsquo;s life as a result of
the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s indwelling and operation. In this way, Romans 8.1&amp;ndash;17
provides the real answer to Romans 2.1&amp;ndash;16. Why is there now &amp;lsquo;no
condemnation&amp;rsquo;? Because, on the one hand, God has condemned sin in the
flesh of Christ (let no-one say, as some have done, that this theme is
absent in my work; it was and remains central in my thinking and my
spirituality); and, on the other hand, because the Spirit is at work to
do, within believers, what the Law could not do &amp;ndash; ultimately, to give
life, but a life that begins in the present with the putting to death of
the deeds of the body and the obedient submission to the leading of the
Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fascinated by the way in which some of those most conscious of
their reformation heritage shy away from Paul&amp;rsquo;s clear statements about
future judgment according to works. It is not often enough remarked
upon, for instance, that in the Thessalonian letters, and in
Philippians, he looks ahead to the coming day of judgment and sees God&amp;rsquo;s
favourable verdict not on the basis of the merits and death of Christ,
not because like Lord Hailsham he simply casts himself on the mercy of
the judge, but on the basis of his apostolic work. &amp;lsquo;What is our hope and
joy and crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus Christ at his royal
appearing? Is it not you? For you are our glory and our joy.&amp;rsquo; (1 Thess.
3.19f.; cp. Phil. 2.16f.) I suspect that if you or I were to say such a
thing, we could expect a swift rebuke of &amp;lsquo;nothing in my hand I bring,
simply to thy cross I cling&amp;rsquo;. The fact that Paul does not feel obliged
at every point to say this shows, I think, that he is not as concerned
as we are about the danger of speaking of the things he himself has done
&amp;ndash; though sometimes, to be sure, he adds a rider, which proves my point,
that it is not his own energy but that which God gives and inspires
within him (1 Cor. 15.10; Col. 1.29). But he is still clear that the
things he does in the present, by moral and physical effort, will count
to his credit on the last day, precisely because they are the effective
signs that the Spirit of the living Christ has been at work in him. We
are embarrassed about saying this kind of thing; Paul clearly is not.
What on earth can have happened to a &lt;em&gt;sola scriptura&lt;/em&gt; theology that it
should find itself forced to screen out such emphatic, indeed
celebratory, statements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future verdict, when it is positive, can be denoted by the verb
&amp;lsquo;justify&amp;rsquo;. This carries its full forensic sense, rooted in the ancient
Jewish belief that the God of Israel, being the creator of the world and
also the God of justice, would finally put the world to rights, in other
words, that he would conduct a final Assize. On that day there will be
&amp;lsquo;glory, honour, immortality and the life of the age to come&amp;rsquo; for all who
do right (Romans 2.7); in other words (verse 13) they will be justified,
declared to be in the right. This ought to have highlighted long ago
something which I believe has played too little part in discussions of
Paul: justification by faith, to which I shall come in a moment, is
the &lt;em&gt;anticipation in the present&lt;/em&gt; of the justification which will occur
in the future, and gains its meaning from that anticipation. What
Augustine lacked, what Luther and Calvin lacked, what Regensburg lacked
as a way of putting together the two things it tried to hold on to, was
Paul&amp;rsquo;s eschatological perspective, filled out by the biblical fusion of
covenantal and forensic categories. But before we get there I want to
address a question which Paul seldom touches explicitly but about which
we can reconstruct his thought quite accurately. This is just as well
because it has played an important role in protestant discussions of
soteriology and lies, I think, at the heart of today&amp;rsquo;s controversies
about justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Ordo Salutis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refer to the question known as &lt;em&gt;ordo salutis&lt;/em&gt;. I take this phrase to
refer to the lining up in chronological sequence of the events which
occur from the time when a human being is outside the community of God&amp;rsquo;s
people, stuck in idolatry and consequent sin, through to the time when
this same erstwhile sinner is fully and finally saved. This question has
been closely bound up with that of justification, but I shall suggest in
this and the next section that when Paul uses the word and its cognates
he has in mind one step only within that sequence, and &amp;ndash; critically, as
you will see &amp;ndash; not the one that the word has been used to denote in
much Christian dogmatics. At this point I am implicitly in dialogue with
a general trend, at least since the sixteenth century, to make
&amp;lsquo;conversion&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;justification&amp;rsquo; more or less coterminous; a trend which
has been sped on its way when &amp;lsquo;conversion&amp;rsquo; is understood as &amp;lsquo;the
establishment of a personal relationship with God&amp;rsquo;, and justification
has been understood in a &amp;lsquo;relational&amp;rsquo; sense with the meaning, not of
membership in the covenant as in the Old Testament, but of this personal
relationship between the believer and God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already described how Paul understands the moment when the gospel
of Jesus as Lord is announced and people come to believe it and obey its
summons. Paul has a regular technical term for this moment, and that
technical term is neither &amp;lsquo;justification&amp;rsquo; nor &amp;lsquo;conversion&amp;rsquo; (though he
can use the latter from time to time): the word in question is &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo;.
&amp;lsquo;Consider your call&amp;rsquo;, he says to the Corinthians; &amp;lsquo;God called me by his
grace&amp;rsquo;, he says of himself. (This is why, incidentally, Krister
Stendahl&amp;rsquo;s suggestion that we should think of Paul&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; as opposed
to his &amp;lsquo;conversion&amp;rsquo; misses the point. For Paul, the word &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; denoted
not merely a vocation to a particular task but also, more fundamentally,
the effective call of the gospel, applied by the Spirit to the
individual heart and life and resulting in a turning away from idolatry
and sin and a lifelong turning to God in Christ in believing
allegiance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; is the central event, the point at which the sinner
turns to God, what comes before and after? Paul himself has given the
answer in Romans 8.29&amp;ndash;30. Though he does not often discuss such things,
he here posits two steps prior to God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; through the gospel: God&amp;rsquo;s
foreknowledge, and God&amp;rsquo;s marking-out-ahead-of-time, the mark in question
being the mark of the image of the Son. (I translate with a paraphrase
because of the problems associated with the word &amp;lsquo;destiny&amp;rsquo; within the
word &amp;lsquo;predestination&amp;rsquo;.) These serve to emphasize, of course, the
sovereignty of God in the call itself, while Paul never engages with the
questions we want to ask about how precisely these things work out. (The
closest he comes is of course Romans 9, which simply restates the
problem for us; the parallel statement in Ephesians 1.3&amp;ndash;14 is a
celebration rather than an explanation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what matters for our purposes even more is the question of what
comes &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo;. &amp;lsquo;Those he called, he also justified&amp;rsquo;. In other
words, Paul uses &amp;lsquo;justify&amp;rsquo; to denote something other than, and logically
subsequent to, what we have often thought of as the moment of
conversion, when someone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t before believed the gospel is
gripped by the word and the Spirit and comes to believe it, to submit to
Jesus as the risen Lord. Here is the central point in the controversy
between what I say about Paul and what the tradition, not least the
protestant tradition, has said. The tradition has used &amp;lsquo;justify&amp;rsquo; and its
cognates to denote conversion, or at least the initial moment of the
Christian life, and has then debated broader and narrower definitions of
what counts. My reading of Paul indicates that he does not use the word
like that; and my method, shared with the reformers, insists that I
prefer scripture itself to even the finest traditions of interpretation.
The fact that the Christian tradition has since at least Augustine used
the word &amp;lsquo;justify&amp;rsquo; to mean &amp;lsquo;become a Christian&amp;rsquo;, whether broadly or
narrowly conceived, is neither here nor there. For Paul, &amp;lsquo;justification&amp;rsquo;
is something that &lt;em&gt;follows on from&lt;/em&gt; the &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; through which a sinner is
summoned to turn from idols and serve the living God, to turn from sin
and follow Christ, to turn from death and believe in the God who raised
Jesus from the dead. This points on to my fifth and final point, to
which we shall come shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before that, we note that the final verb in Paul&amp;rsquo;s sequence is not
&amp;lsquo;sanctified&amp;rsquo;. He would say that this has already happened to all
baptised believers (see 1 Corinthians 6.10f.). It is &amp;lsquo;glorified&amp;rsquo;. Paul
regards it as a fixed point that those who belong to the Messiah by
faith and baptism already share his glorious life, his rule over the
world, and that this rule, this glory, will one day be manifest. There
is no time to develop this here, but I note, as a point which much
dogmatics has yet to come to terms with, the fact that both Paul and
John the Seer place great emphasis not just on being saved, not just on
being raised from the dead, but on sharing the glorious rule of Jesus
Christ as Lord over God&amp;rsquo;s new world. What this role will consist of, who
or what will be in subjection under this rule, and so on, are questions
which have fallen off most people&amp;rsquo;s radar screens. I suggest it&amp;rsquo;s time
we got them back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I have said enough in this short section to convince you of two
things. First, my understanding of how Paul supposed someone became a
Christian is, I think, basically orthodox and indeed reformed. God takes
the initiative, based on his foreknowledge; the preached word, through
which the Spirit is at work, is the effective agent; belief in the
gospel, that is, believing submission to Jesus as the risen Lord, is the
direct result. My central point is that &lt;em&gt;this isn&amp;rsquo;t what Paul is
referring to when he speaks of &amp;lsquo;justification&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;. But the substance of
what reformed theology, unlike Paul, has referred to by means of that
word remains. Faith is not something someone does as a result of which
God decides to grant them a new status or privilege. Becoming a
Christian, in its initial moment, is not based on anything that a person
has acquired by birth or achieved by merit. Faith is itself the first
fruit of the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s call. And those thus called, to return to
Philippians 1.6, can be sure that the one who began a good work in them
will complete it at the day of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it is simply not true, as people have said again and again, that
I deny or downplay the place of the individual in favour of a corporate
ecclesiology. True, I have reacted against the rampant individualism of
western culture, and have tried to insist on a biblically rooted
corporate solidarity in the body of Christ as an antidote to it. But
this in no way reduces the importance of every person being confronted
with the powerful gospel, and the need for each one to be turned around
by it from idols to God, from sin to holiness, and from death to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Justification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then is &amp;lsquo;justification&amp;rsquo;, if it is not conversion itself, not the
establishment of a &amp;lsquo;relationship&amp;rsquo; between a person and God, but
something which is, at least logically, consequent upon it? This is
where confusion inevitably creeps in. I have argued again and again that
Paul uses &lt;em&gt;dikaioo&lt;/em&gt; and its cognates to denote something other than
conversion itself; but several critics have not listened to this, but
have imagined that what I say about Paul&amp;rsquo;s use of
the &lt;em&gt;dikaioo&lt;/em&gt; word-group is my proposed description of his theology of
conversion; and they have then charged me with all kinds of interesting
heresies. To make this clear, let me use instead a near-synonym, and
speak here not of &amp;lsquo;justification&amp;rsquo; but of &amp;lsquo;vindication&amp;rsquo;, recognising that
this is itself controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My proposal has been, and still is, that Paul uses &amp;lsquo;vindication&amp;rsquo;
language, i.e. the &lt;em&gt;dikaioo&lt;/em&gt; word-group, when he is describing, not the
moment when, or the process by which, someone comes from idolatry, sin
and death to God, Christ and life, but rather the verdict which God
pronounces consequent upon that event. &lt;em&gt;dikaioo&lt;/em&gt; is after all a
declarative word, declaring that something is the case, rather than a
word for making something happen or changing the way something is. (Nor
do we need to get round this, as many have done, by saying that when God
declares something to be the case he brings it into being; that&amp;rsquo;s not
the point here.) And if we work backwards from the future vindication I
spoke of earlier I believe we can see what this declaration amounts to,
and why Paul insisted on it, especially in Romans and Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language of vindication, the &lt;em&gt;dikaioo&lt;/em&gt; language, is as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen
lawcourt language. Lawcourt imagery is appropriate because God is the
God of justice, who is bound to put the world to rights, has promised to
do so, and intends to keep his promises. But the means by which he will
do so, from Genesis 12 onwards, is through the covenant he has made with
Abraham; so that God&amp;rsquo;s covenant faithfulness on the one hand, and God&amp;rsquo;s
justice on the other, are not two quite different things, but closely
interlinked. Both are indicated, as we have seen, in the
phrase &lt;em&gt;dikaiosune theou&lt;/em&gt;. When we talk of God&amp;rsquo;s vindication of someone
we are talking about God&amp;rsquo;s declaration, which appears as a double thing
to us but I suspect a single thing to Paul: the declaration (a) that
someone is in the right (their sins having been forgiven through the
death of Jesus) and (b) that this person is a member of the true
covenant family, the family God originally promised to Abraham and has
now created through Christ and the Spirit, the single family which
consists equally of believing Jews and believing Gentiles. I submit that
this way of lining things up draws together the various categories which
are otherwise left untidily around the place: forensic in Luther versus
adoption in Calvin, lawcourt versus incorporative in Schweitzer and
Sanders. Once you grasp Paul&amp;rsquo;s underlying covenantal theology these
dichotomies are overcome. My first main point in this subsection is
therefore that these two things &amp;ndash; declaring sinners to be in the right,
with their sins forgiven, and declaring someone to be a member of the
single multi-ethnic covenant family &amp;ndash; go very closely together in
Paul&amp;rsquo;s mind, and that to point out the importance of the latter
(belonging to the family) in passages like Romans 3 or Galatians 3 in no
way undermines the importance of the former (being one of those now
declared &amp;lsquo;in the right&amp;rsquo; in God&amp;rsquo;s lawcourt). The underlying point here is
crucial: the reason God established the covenant with Abraham, according
to scripture in general and Paul in particular, was to undo the sin of
Adam and its effects and thereby to complete the project of the good
creation itself. Thus God&amp;rsquo;s declaration of forgiveness and his
declaration of covenant membership are not ultimately two different
things. I freely grant that some of those who have highlighted the
importance of the Jew-plus-Gentile point in Paul have used it as a way
of saying that Paul is therefore not after all interested in God&amp;rsquo;s
dealing with sins and putting sinners in a right relation to himself.
But just because people draw false inferences one way, that is no reason
why we should draw them the other way. Let me take two obvious examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, in Romans 3.21&amp;ndash;31, by anyone&amp;rsquo;s showing a vital and central
passage, Paul makes what most commentators in the reformation tradition
regard as a strange shift in verse 29, when he asks &amp;lsquo;Or is God the God
of the Jews only?&amp;rsquo; (Notice how the NIV, for instance, omits the word
&amp;lsquo;Or&amp;rsquo;.) If he had been talking all along simply about individual sinners
being put right with God, we should indeed regard this as a sudden
intrusion of ethnic questions. But he hasn&amp;rsquo;t. As chapter 4 will reveal,
when we allow it to play its full role, he has been talking about God&amp;rsquo;s
faithfulness to the covenant with Abraham, and about God&amp;rsquo;s creation of a
single family from both halves of sinful humanity. God&amp;rsquo;s declaring that
sinners are now in a right relation to himself and God&amp;rsquo;s declaring that
believing Jews and believing Gentiles belong in the same family are
inextricably bound up with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same point emerges in Galatians 2.11&amp;ndash;21. Here, beyond cavil I
think, the point of vindication is not &amp;lsquo;how someone becomes a Christian&amp;rsquo;
but the question of table-fellowship: with whom may I, indeed must I,
share table-fellowship? Peter&amp;rsquo;s action in separating himself from
Christian Gentiles was not implying that they needed to perform moral
good works; it was implying that they needed to become physically
Jewish. Paul&amp;rsquo;s argument against him was not to do with the mechanism of
how people come from being sinful idolaters to forgiven members of
Christ&amp;rsquo;s people, but with the equality within the people of God of all
who believe the gospel, Jew and Gentile alike. That controversy, indeed,
dominates the entire letter in a way that, alas, I think Martin Luther
never saw (though specialists may correct me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then is this vindication, this &lt;em&gt;dikaiosis&lt;/em&gt;? It is God&amp;rsquo;s declaration
that a person is in the right; that is, (a) that their sins have been
forgiven, and (b) that they are part of the single covenant family
promised to Abraham. Notice that opening phrase: God&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;declaration
that&lt;/em&gt;. Not &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo;s bringing it about that&amp;rsquo;, but God&amp;rsquo;s authoritative
declaration of what is in fact the case. This is the point, of course,
where some have accused me of semi-Pelagianism. That might be so if I
intended to denote, with the word &amp;lsquo;justification&amp;rsquo;, what the tradition
has denoted. But I don&amp;rsquo;t. Paul, I believe, uses
vindication/justification to denote God&amp;rsquo;s declaration about someone,
about (more specifically) the person who has been &amp;lsquo;called&amp;rsquo; in the sense
described above. Vindication is not the same as call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we now discover that this declaration, this vindication, occurs
twice. It occurs in the future, as we have seen, on the basis of the
entire life a person has led in the power of the Spirit &amp;ndash; that is, it
occurs on the basis of &amp;lsquo;works&amp;rsquo; in Paul&amp;rsquo;s redefined sense. And, near the
heart of Paul&amp;rsquo;s theology, it occurs in the present &lt;em&gt;as an anticipation
of that future verdict&lt;/em&gt;, when someone, responding in believing obedience
to the &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; of the gospel, believes that Jesus is Lord and that God
raised him from the dead. This is the point about justification by faith
&amp;ndash; to revert to the familiar terminology: it is the &lt;em&gt;anticipation in the
present&lt;/em&gt; of the verdict which will be &lt;em&gt;reaffirmed in the future&lt;/em&gt;.
Justification is not &amp;lsquo;how someone becomes a Christian&amp;rsquo;. It is God&amp;rsquo;s
declaration about the person who has just become a Christian. And, just
as the final declaration will consist, not of words so much as of an
event, namely, the resurrection of the person concerned into a glorious
body like that of the risen Jesus, so the present declaration consists,
not so much of words, though words there may be, but of an event, the
event in which one dies with the Messiah and rises to new life with him,
anticipating that final resurrection. In other words, baptism. I was
delighted yesterday to discover that not only Chrysostom and Augustine
but also Luther would here have agreed with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional protestants may not like this much, but it is I submit what
Paul is saying. And I want you to notice right away, before I draw some
broader conclusions from all this, three things that follow. First,
Paul&amp;rsquo;s doctrine of what is true of those who are in the Messiah does the
job, within his scheme of thought, that the traditional protestant
emphasis on the imputation of Christ&amp;rsquo;s righteousness did within that
scheme. In other words, that which imputed righteousness was trying to
insist upon is, I think, fully taken care of in (for instance) Romans 6,
where Paul declares that what is true of the Messiah is true of all his
people. Jesus was vindicated by God as Messiah after his penal death; I
am in the Messiah; therefore I too have died and been raised. According
to Romans 6, when God looks at the baptised Christian he sees him or her
in Christ. But Paul does not say that he sees us clothed with the earned
merits of Christ. That would of course be the wrong meaning of
&amp;lsquo;righteous&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;righteousness&amp;rsquo;. He sees us within the &lt;em&gt;vindication&lt;/em&gt; of
Christ, that is, as having died with Christ and risen again with him. I
suspect that it was the mediaeval over-concentration on righteousness,
on &lt;em&gt;iustitia&lt;/em&gt;, that caused the protestant reformers to push for imputed
righteousness to do the job they rightly saw was needed. But in my view
they have thereby distorted what Paul himself was saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it emerges that justification, for Paul, is not (in Sanders&amp;rsquo;s
terminology) how one &amp;lsquo;gets in&amp;rsquo; to God&amp;rsquo;s people, but about God&amp;rsquo;s
declaration that someone &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in. In other words, it is all about
assurance &amp;ndash; as we should have known from reading Romans. I&amp;rsquo;ve said it
before and this is the place to say it again: if we are thinking Paul&amp;rsquo;s
thoughts after him, we are not justified by faith by believing in
justification by faith. We are justified by faith by believing in the
gospel itself &amp;ndash; in other words, that Jesus is Lord and that God raised
him from the dead. If, in addition, we believe in justification by faith
itself, we believe that, amazingly considering what God knows about us,
we are now and for ever part of the family to every member of which God
says what he said to Jesus at his baptism: you are my beloved child,
with you I am well pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it follows at once that justification is the
original &lt;em&gt;ecumenical&lt;/em&gt; doctrine. The first time we meet justification,
that is, in Galatians 2, it is about people from different cultures and
traditions sharing table-fellowship on the basis of nothing other than
their shared faith in Jesus as Messiah and Lord. Once we relocate
justification, moving it from the discussion of how people become
Christians to the discussion of how we know that someone is a Christian,
we have a powerful incentive to work together across denominational
barriers. One of the sad ironies of the last four hundred years is that,
at least since 1541, we have allowed disputes about how people become
Christians &amp;ndash; that which we thought was denoted by the language of
justification &amp;ndash; to divide us, when the doctrine of justification
itself, urging us to unite across our cultural divides, went unheard.
Not that there are not large and important problems in ecumenical
relations. I am horrified at some of the recent Anglican/Roman
statements, for instance, and on things like the Papacy, purgatory, and
the cult of saints (especially Mary), I am as protestant as the next
person, for (I take it) good Pauline reasons. But justification by faith
tells me that if my Roman neighbour believes that Jesus is Lord and that
God raised him from the dead then he or she is a brother or sister,
however much I believe them muddled, even dangerously so, on other
matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Conclusion]{.ul}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, I suspect, said enough to put the cat among the pigeons, but not
enough to get it back into its basket. That will have to come, if at
all, in question and answers. But let me conclude with four brief
propositions about the importance of taking at least this version of the
New Perspective seriously, and one flagrantly homiletic plea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to restate the point of method. I remain committed to
understanding Paul in his own right and his own terms against all
traditions about him, including my own. I remain convinced that Luther
and Calvin would say Amen to that point of principle. And I believe, and
have argued in my various exegetical works, that this reading of Paul
makes far more sense of his letters, in whole and in their various
parts, and in their mutual relations, than all other readings known to
me. Part of that exegetical task is to relate Paul to the Jewish world
of his day, and this reading I believe does that far better than the
traditional one, though debates naturally remain about many aspects of
the Jewish context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, this reading of Paul allows fully for the challenge to each
person to hear and believe the gospel and live by it, while at the same
time allowing fully also for three other contexts, each of which is
vitally important to Paul, to have their place. These three other
contexts are the cosmic, as in Romans 8; the ecclesiological, as in his
constant emphasis on the unity of Jew and Gentile in Christ; and the
political, as mentioned earlier. Many have tried to play these off
against each other; I believe they are instead mutually reinforcing. The
united multi-ethnic church is a sign of God&amp;rsquo;s healing and remaking of
the cosmos and also thereby a sign to Caesar and his followers that his
attempted unification of the world is a blasphemous parody. This is part
of what Ephesians and Colossians are all about, though that is another
story. It is also, I believe, a point in urgent need of emphasis today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, this new perspective reading of Paul enables us to understand,
crucially for some current debates in my church at least, why Paul is
very tolerant of differences on some points (particularly food, drink
and holy days) and completely intolerant on others (particularly sexual
ethics). The boundary lines he insists on blurring (in, for instance,
Romans 14 and 1 Corinthians 8) are precisely those between different
ethnic communities, particularly Jew and Gentile. The boundary lines he
draws the more firmly are those between the holy lifestyle required of
those who have died and been raised with the Messiah and the unholy
lifestyle of those who behave as if they had not, but were still living
&amp;lsquo;in the flesh&amp;rsquo;. This, too, is urgent today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, I discover an irony in the anti-New Perspective reaction in
specifically Reformed circles. The New Perspective launched by Sanders
and taken up eagerly in many American contexts was always a reaction,
not to Reformed readings of Paul, but to Lutheran ones and the broader
protestantism and evangelicalism that went along for the Lutheran ride,
particularly in its negative assessment of Judaism and its Law. Had the
Reformed reading of Paul, with its positive role for Israel and the Law,
been in the ascendancy rather than the Lutheran one, the New Perspective
might not have been necessary, or not in that form. For myself, it may
surprise you to learn that I still think of myself as a Reformed
theologian, retaining what seems to me the substance of Reformed
theology while moving some of the labels around in obedience to
scripture &amp;ndash; itself, as I have suggested, a good Reformed sort of thing
to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end with a plea. I have lived most of my life in and around
evangelical circles in which I have come to recognise a strange
phenomenon. It is commonly assumed that Luther and Calvin got Paul
right. But often when people think of Luther and Calvin they see them,
and hence Paul, through three subsequent lenses provided by western
culture. The Enlightenment highlighted the abstract truths of reason
over against the messy facts of history; many Protestants have put
Lessing and Luther together and still thought they were reading Paul.
The Romantic movement highlighted inner feeling over against outer,
physical reality; many have thence supposed that this was what Paul, and
Luther and Calvin, were really saying (hence the knee-jerk protestant
anti-sacramentalism). More recently, existentialism has insisted that
what matters is being true to my inner self, rather than being
conditioned by history, mine or anyone else&amp;rsquo;s; many people, not only
Rudolf Bultmann, have read Paul and Luther in that light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a popular level, this mess and muddle shows up in a general sense
that anything inward, anything to do with strong religious emotion,
anything which downplays outward observance, must be striking a blow for
the Pauline gospel of justification by faith. This is as worrying as it
is absurd. All these movements are forms of dualism, where Paul believed
in the goodness and God-givenness of creation, and in its eventual
promised renewal. Together they reinforce that gnosticism which is a
poison at the heart of much contemporary culture, including soi-disant
Christian culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time to turn away from all this; to rub our eyes, and look clearly
at the path by which we and our culture have come. It is time to turn
back again, following the old &lt;em&gt;sola scriptura&lt;/em&gt; principle, to the source
and origin of one of the great doctrines of the New Testament: that
when, through God&amp;rsquo;s effective call (&lt;em&gt;sola gratia&lt;/em&gt;) in the preaching of
the gospel of Jesus Christ (&lt;em&gt;solus Christus&lt;/em&gt;), someone comes to believe
that he is the risen Messiah and Lord, God thereupon (&lt;em&gt;sola fide&lt;/em&gt;)
declares in advance what he will declare on the last day when he raises
that person from the dead: this person is in the right, their sins have
been forgiven, they are part of the single, true, worldwide covenant
family promised to Abraham, the sign of the coming new creation and the
counter-sign to the boast of Caesar. Justification is ultimately about
justice, about God putting the world to rights, with his chosen and
called people as the advance guard of that new creation, charged with
being and bringing signs of hope, of restorative justice, to the world.
Let&amp;rsquo;s put the justice back in justification; and, as we do so, remind
ourselves whose justice it is, and why. &lt;em&gt;Soli Deo Gloria&lt;/em&gt;! Having thus
stolen Luther&amp;rsquo;s slogans, I thought I might end with &amp;lsquo;Here I stand&amp;rsquo;; but
let me rather say it in Paul&amp;rsquo;s language. &lt;em&gt;hode hesteka; allo ou
dunamai&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Perspectives on Paul - SJD notes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/nt-wright/new-perspectives-on-paul-sjd-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/nt-wright/new-perspectives-on-paul-sjd-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It makes sense of Paul&#39;s positive comments about the law in Romans and
his negative comments on Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Paul talks about the Jews trying to establish their righteousness
through the law, he means establishing their membership of God&#39;s
covenant people, by which they are justified - not their moral
perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever Paul discusses justification it is in the context of a critique
of Judaism and the unity of God&#39;s people in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gospel is always the climax of the Jewish covenant with Jesus as
this world&#39;s true and only king and Lord. It is not &amp;quot;this is how you
can be saved&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;Jesus is lord&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God&#39;s righteousness is his faithfulness to this covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul believed that the proclaimed that Jesus is lord is empowered by the
holy spirit to bring conversion. It is primarily a summons to obedience.
Thus, no one can say&amp;quot;Jesus is lord&amp;quot; except by the holy spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul&#39;s phrase, &amp;quot;the righteousness of God&amp;quot; (often wrongly translated
as righteousness from God, esp in Rom 3:21-26) always refers to his
faithfulness to the covenant, to rescue and justify his people. But it
also includes his judgement of the wicked. Thus...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 2:5-7 But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant
heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God&#39;s
wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. God &amp;quot;will repay
each person according to what they have done. To those who by
persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will
give eternal life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This covenant faithfulness is why the gospel expounded in Romans leads
from chapter 8 into chapter 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justification is not God imputing righteousness to us now, but
pronouncing our belonging to him on judgement day on which we will be
judged according to our works, which for a Christian, will be found
acceptable. They are the works which demonstrate the life of the spirit
in us. Phil 1:6. Those are the putting to death of the deeds of the
flesh by the life of the spirit- Rom 8:1-17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how Paul boasts of the evidence in his own life in the disciples
he has made. 1thes 3:19, Phil 2:16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are justified by faith in Christ in the sense that we rightly
anticipate that future declaration because through faith in Chris as
lord we are included in God&#39;s people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proper meaning of being justified is not to have righteousness
imputed to us, but having a judgement made about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God does indeed count us righteous because we believe. But that
righteousness is not God&#39;s righteousness, or Christ&#39;s righteousness,
but the righteousness of being one of God&#39;s children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person is saved by hearing the announcement that Jesus is lord,
believing this to be true and giving themselves to obedience and bring
baptised&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This constitutes their call, as Paul puts it in Rom 8:29ff. And
celebrates in Ephesians 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the call, on judgement day we will be justified and glorified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 6:11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, but
you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord
Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that Justification is a declaration of a fact, not its
impartation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justification by faith is the anticipation of that ultimate verdict. We
can be sure of that verdict, because Jesus was vindicated in his
resurrection, and we are in him. Rom 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justification is therefore not about how we are saved, but assurance
that we are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membership of God&#39;s people and final Justification are synonymous, one
goes with the other. Hence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 3:28-29 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith
apart from the deeds of the law. Or [is He] the God of the Jews only?
[Is He] not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus explains why Paul is so rejecting of the identity aspects of the
law, and do insistent on the moral aspects of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Our Vision for Simple Church</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/our-vision-for-simple-church/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/our-vision-for-simple-church/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;our-vision-for-simple-church&#34;&gt;Our Vision for Simple Church&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obey-my-commands&#34;&gt;Obey My Commands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not make a big thing of commands. He didn&amp;rsquo;t leave us with the
Ten Commandments of Christ, indeed most of his instructions are hidden
in his sermons and parables and don&amp;rsquo;t come across like commands. But
there are two prominent exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.&amp;quot; (John
15:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and
teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.&amp;quot; (Matt 28:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of these two great commands of Jesus, the motto of &lt;em&gt;Life For
Liberia&lt;/em&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Love one another; go and make disciples&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blessed-are-those-who-hear-my-word-and-do-it&#34;&gt;Blessed are those who hear my word and do it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history God has struggled to get His people to hear and obey
His word, and it has been the constant cry of the prophets for the
people to turn back to the ways of the Lord. Throughout Jesus&#39; ministry
we see Him trying to turn people&amp;rsquo;s attention away from their religious
traditions and make simple obedience to God their priority. We believe
that God has called us to carry this appeal from the Holy Spirit to our
friends in Liberia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cry and our message to you is to measure everything you do by these
two commands of Jesus, and let that be the test of its value: &amp;ldquo;Love one
another; go and make disciples&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unhelpful-traditions&#34;&gt;Unhelpful Traditions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in
order to observe your own traditions!&amp;rdquo; (Mark 7:9). We are all guilty, in
our efforts to establish churches, of the tendency to adopt traditions
and copy practices that we see in other churches simply because &amp;ldquo;that is
what churches do&amp;rdquo;. Instead, we should be testing everything against the
scriptures and in particular the commands to love one another and go and
make disciples. We must not assume that what we or others have always
done is what Jesus is calling us to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-yoke-is-easy&#34;&gt;My yoke is easy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus invites us to take His yoke upon us &amp;ldquo;For my yoke is easy and my
burden is light&amp;rdquo; (Matthew 11:30). But sadly, we tend to lay heavy yokes
upon believers through our traditions. For the early church it was the
heavy weight of the Jewish traditions that had to be thrown off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of
Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to
bear?&amp;rdquo; (Acts 15:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about us? As leaders in the Body of Christ we will have to give
an account to Jesus for the burdens we have laid upon the necks of our
people whom Jesus has invited to share His yoke. Take a moment to
reflect on all we ask people to do and be committed to in maintaining
our church buildings and running our church programs. Would Jesus
describe this as an easy yoke and a light burden? Can we justify the
demands we place on church members by the fruit it is bearing in
obedience to the commands to love one another and go and make disciples?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-of-the-kingdom&#34;&gt;The Gospel of the Kingdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus and the apostles preached the Gospel of the Kingdom. We get a
clear picture of this gospel from Paul&amp;rsquo;s account of what Jesus told him
to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they
may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are
sanctified by faith in me.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 26:18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of the Kingdom is what we are called to preach. It has
several clear elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am sending you to them&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; We must go out and not expect people
to come to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to open their eyes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; We try to open their eyes so that they can
see for themselves the darkness they are living in. This is done
through asking them about their lives, listening to them and helping
them to evaluate the things they put their hope and trust in. We
cannot open their eyes by simply telling them what they should
believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;turn them from darkness to light&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; repentance is a complete
change of direction touching every aspect of their lives. It is to
welcome and walk in God&amp;rsquo;s light, and no longer try to hide their
behaviour in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from the power of Satan to God&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; salvation is both turning from
and deliverance from the works and ways and power of Satan. We must
reject evil and African traditional spiritual practices. We need to
be delivered from evil spirits and cut off every curse. We must
stand firm in the confidence that as children of God, Satan has no
power or hold over us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;receive forgiveness of sins&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Through our faith and trust in
Jesus as the supreme King over all things in heaven and earth (Eph
1:20-23), and through Baptism in water and Baptism in the Holy
Spirit (John 3:5) we are born-again and receive complete forgiveness
of our sins. Forgiveness is given freely and completely in response
to our faith in Jesus. Forgiveness is not, and never will be, given
because of our efforts to live holy lives. See Hebrews 10:1-18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; As
disciples of Jesus we are welcomed by Jesus into His family, and He
is not ashamed to call us His brothers and sisters. To be a disciple
is to belong to Jesus&#39; family and to give and receive love in that
family. Because our hearts have been changed by Jesus, we will want
to walk in the light and turn away from every kind of darkness. But
however we may fail, we are secure in the love of God and in Jesus
who stands as our righteousness before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Gospel of the Kingdom which Jesus has commissioned us to
preach. We are careful to maintain both the simplicity and the fullness
of the Gospel. We do not complicate it with unnecessary explanations of
theological truths, but neither do we reduce it to a simplistic appeal
to come into the embrace of our loving heavenly Father. The only proper
response to the Gospel is repentance, faith and baptism in water and the
Holy Spirit. We cannot leave any one of these elements out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;christ-in-us-the-hope-of-glory-col-127&#34;&gt;Christ in us, the hope of Glory (Col 1:27)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bible makes it very clear that righteousness is found in God alone.
We try to be clear and consistent in teaching that our righteousness is
based solely upon Christ. He alone is our righteousness. The accuser has
been thrown out of God&amp;rsquo;s presence and instead Jesus stands in our place;
and He is the Radiance of God&amp;rsquo;s own righteousness. The greatest
hindrance to our own sanctification is self-condemnation and the
condemnation of others (especially other Christians). We agree with
Paul, that the starting point for our growth in obedience is that there
is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our teaching and discipling our starting point is always Christ our
Righteousness and the unconditional love of God for us. We minister and
pray with Paul&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power
through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in
your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and
established in love, may have power, together with all the saints, to
grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and
to know this love that surpasses knowledge - that you may be filled to
the measure of all the fullness of God. Now to him who is able to do
immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power
that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ
Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen (Eph
3:16-21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is not all! In Christ, God wells in us in His fullness (Eph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have
been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am
going to the Father. (13) And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so
that the Son may bring glory to the Father. (14) You may ask me for
anything in my name, and I will do it (John 14:12-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;healing-and-deliverance&#34;&gt;Healing and Deliverance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus made healing and deliverance central to His gospel message and
told his disciples to do the same. In obedience to Jesus, we keep
healing and deliverance at the centre of our proclamation and sharing of
the gospel. No matter what the outcome, we keep proclaiming healing and
expect God to act. We act in obedience to Jesus, not from fear of
failure. But we don&amp;rsquo;t stop with healing. The Gospel is about restoring
our relationship with God, and that is always our focus and goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baptism&#34;&gt;Baptism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In obedience to Jesus, we baptise new believers in water as soon as we
can. We encourage this to be arranged and performed as it was in the New
Testament &amp;ndash; in a family setting (by the Growth Group), rather than as a
church event. Baptism is how we share in Christ&amp;rsquo;s death and
resurrection. It should include deliverance from all past spiritual
involvement, curses, magic or superstitious practices, African or
ancestral rituals, belief and practices. This includes deliverance from
harmful experiences of the past from parents and all other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baptism-in-the-holy-spirit&#34;&gt;Baptism in the Holy Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water baptism is followed by prayer to receive the powerful baptism in
the Holy Spirit. We dare not depart from Jesus teaching that unless we
are born of water and of the Spirit, we cannot be part of God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom
(John 3:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as with healing and deliverance, we persist in praying for the
transforming presence and power of the Holy Spirit for ourselves and for
others, knowing that it is the Father&amp;rsquo;s good pleasure to give the Holy
Spirit to those who ask (Acts 1:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage disciples to practice the spiritual gifts of tongues (as a
God-given means of building up our inner spiritual life) and prophecy
(as a God-given means of building up the church). These &amp;ldquo;gateway&amp;rdquo; gifts
help us to walk more deeply with the Spirit and explore the whole range
of Spiritual gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discipleship-as-apprenticeship&#34;&gt;Discipleship as Apprenticeship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary emphases of many churches is teaching. A great deal
of time is spent both preparing and delivering teaching every week, and
church members are urged to come and listen to all this teaching. We too
are passionate about good teaching in the church, but we also believe
that the emphasis on teaching in many churches is miss-placed. The
problem is that most churches view understanding as discipleship, or
they see teaching as the primary means of discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jesus did not say &amp;ldquo;teach them everything I have commanded you&amp;rdquo;; He
said &amp;ldquo;teach them to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; everything I have commanded you&amp;rdquo;. Because
of this we talk about discipleship as an apprenticeship. Discipleship is
practicing doing what Jesus commanded us, and the only effective way to
disciple another person is to demonstrate and practice obedience to
Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason we urge leaders to minimise the focus on teaching
sessions in their churches and maximise their focus on demonstration.
The teaching should be enough to provide understanding for the
demonstration and no more. After putting the teaching into practice, the
apprentices can be gathered for discussion and further teaching to
support more fruitful obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching and preaching should be a response to the demands of
apprenticeship and its value measured against its effectiveness in
motivating obedience to the command to love one another and go and make
disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-body-of-christ&#34;&gt;The Body of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Body of Christ is &amp;ldquo;joined and held together by every supporting
ligament, growing and building itself up in love, as each part does its
work&amp;rdquo; (Eph 4:16). This is the Holy Spirit&amp;rsquo;s description of church. It is
not crippled and paralysed with non-functioning parts, the members are
not in competition with one another, it is not held together by
structures and programs and coercion but by &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;every supporting
ligament&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (the abilities that each one has). And it grows, not by
leaders and teaching and programs, but by &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;each&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; part doing its
work. And growth is not measured by bottoms-on-seats but by &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church, the Body of Christ, is the self-supporting family of
disciples who love and care for one another and build one another up
through all their varied gifts and abilities so that the Kingdom of God
is made visible in their community. The Holy Spirit will guide the
church in appointing leaders who will serve the church by keeping it
focussed on the commands of Jesus to love one another and go and make
disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;walking-in-the-light&#34;&gt;Walking in the Light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a Christian is not a show we put on, but the life we live. Jesus
commands that we walk in truth and light before God and with one
another. We reject pretence and rejoice that God is happy to have
fellowship with us despite our failures. So we accept ourselves and one
another as Jesus does. We accept Jesus&#39; teaching that there can be no
true fellowship between us unless we are open and truthful with one
another. We try to be open and truthful and encourage others to be open
and truthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shared-meals&#34;&gt;Shared Meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared meals were at the heart of Jesus&#39; ministry and He told His
disciples to continue sharing meals (at the Last Supper). Traditional
churches have abandoned this command, but we seek to be obedient. Shared
meals are at the heart of our fellowship and our outreach. Shared meals
lead into worship, prayer and ministry to one another. We invite others
to join us where they can witness the love and fellowship between
believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-meeting-place&#34;&gt;A Meeting Place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches have become associated with church buildings and this
association has brought many problems. The message of evangelism has
become &amp;quot;Go to church...&amp;quot; instead of bringing healing and deliverance
into people&#39;s homes. Discipleship has become &amp;quot;Go to church&amp;quot; instead
of listening to and obeying Jesus in our homes. Church-planting has
become a matter of erecting buildings instead of planting groups of
disciples. Church buildings are used to provide churches with a sense of
identity and prestige &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;No one will take your church seriously if you
don&#39;t have your own building...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said we should be a light set on a hill, not hidden away. When
looking for a place to gather believers for worship, fellowship, shared
meals and teaching, we look first for public buildings where believers
are easily seen by the community and where non-members can easily come
and see what is happening. The first choice would be a palaver hut or
market area or some other open and public place. Perhaps a clinic or
school may be usable, or a house with a large porch. If no such place is
available we recommend approaching the community leaders and proposing
that the community erect a suitable meeting place which the church can
share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A church based on Growth Groups can grow and multiply and church plant
without ever having its own building. Buildings must be seen as a luxury
for communities that can well afford them rather than as a necessity for
mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;simple-church&#34;&gt;Simple Church&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our appeal and our vision is that we examine everything we do and
everything we teach in the light of Jesus&#39; two great commands and return
to the simplest expression of church that is effective in fulfilling
those commands. Anything and everything we add to the simplest
expression of church must be in obedience to the scriptures and
justifiable in terms of its effectiveness and fruitfulness in love and
discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our vision includes regional and local leadership structures, eldership
and apostleship, large and small church gatherings, church buildings,
schools, theological training, helping the poor etc. etc., But our
priority and starting point is discipleship through Growth Groups. We
see these as the basic unit of church and the essential foundation for
obedience to the commands to love one another and go and make disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach is to build church &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; obedient disciples, rather than
to try and make obedient disciples through our church programs. Our
focus is therefore primarily bottom-up rather than top-down. We do not
believe you need a &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; to make disciples; rather you need disciples
to make a church. We start with disciple-making through Growth Groups,
and then see what the Holy Spirit is saying about gathering Growth
Groups into larger church groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of church buildings is also important in Simple Church. Please
see &amp;ldquo;How Church Buildings Cripple the Gospel&amp;rdquo; on the website for a
discussion of this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-vision-of-the-future&#34;&gt;A vision of the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Groups as the foundation and basic unit of church and
discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities transformed through Growth Groups reaching out to their
neighbours in love with the Gospel of the Kingdom, including healing
and deliverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers baptised in water and the Holy Spirit, walking in the
light and secure in their righteousness in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipleship primarily through active apprenticeship not listening
to teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unity of the Body of Christ expressed through the regular
gathering of believers together for a shared meal and prayer in
obedience to Jesus command at the last supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimal burden on believers &amp;ndash; the simplest possible expression of
church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimal emphasis on church buildings &amp;ndash; use of existing facilities
wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching sessions kept to the minimum and immediately put into
practice through apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplying many small self-governing churches in relationship
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership viewed as one of the many gifts given to serve the Body
of Christ by keeping it focussed on loving one another and making
disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership setting an example in apprenticing others and walking in
light and truth with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope and pray that you are inspired by this biblical vision for
discipleship and will want to join with us as we seek to walk with Jesus
our brother, friend and King.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recalibrating our Understanding</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/missional-communities/recalibrating-our-understanding/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/missional-communities/recalibrating-our-understanding/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;recalibrating-our-understanding&#34;&gt;Recalibrating our understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we have grown so accustomed to services as we know them, that
we need to question our assumptions and recalibrate our understanding of
many basic concepts. For instance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is worship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is discipleship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the church?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should Christians meet together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is our mission?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brief answers to these questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Worship is a significant conversation with God.&amp;quot; By this I mean it
has an impact on our obedience to Jesus, and it is a two-way
conversation where we also listen and hear. Praying and singing may be
helpful, but they are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; essential ingredients of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Discipleship is a Spirit filled person listening to and being obedient
to Jesus that results in bearing fruit that endures to eternal life.&amp;quot;
It is not learning about Jesus, or living a good and moral life, or
faithfully attending church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The church is literally the &lt;em&gt;assembly&lt;/em&gt;, which derives from the
governing body of a community. It is not simply a Christian version of
the synagogue; it has a different purpose. It is a meeting of the
disciples of Jesus in a locality for the purpose of transforming its
wider community.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Christians should meet together to love one another and encourage one
another to love and good works. This should often / usually be in the
context of sharing a meal in celebration of His death and resurrection,
the presence of His Kingdom and the promise of His return in glory.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our mission is to make obedient disciples throughout the nations.&amp;quot;
Jesus never tried to recruit members; rather He put people off with His
outrageous claims and warnings. We are not called to get people to come
to church, or believe in God, or live moral lives. There are many who
live close to Jesus, but nevertheless do not belong to Him. (Luke
13:26-27 &amp;quot;You will say &#39;We ate and drank in your presence and you
taught in our streets&#39; But I will answer, &#39;I do not know you. Depart
from me...&#39;&amp;quot; The only measure of discipleship that Jesus uses is
fruitful obedience. We do terrible harm to the mission of the church by
watering down Jesus&#39; words and making Him acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pursue our mission by healing and deliverance and declaration the
presence of the Kingdom of God to those who do not know Him. We are to
go after lost sheep (those closest to us who are not obedient disciples)
and to the dark places in our communities.&amp;quot; Our mission is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to run
church services!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Receiving Healing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/healing/receiving-healing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/healing/receiving-healing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;receiving-healing&#34;&gt;Receiving Healing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Christians believe that God can and does heal today &amp;ndash; there are
simply too many accounts of miraculous healing to deny it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, not everyone is healed. Indeed, for most of us our
experience is that most are not miraculously healed; mostly we heal
naturally or through doctors, and some remain sick and may die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian response to this is usually to say that God wants some
people to glorify Him in healing and health and for others to glorify
Him in their joy and peace in their sickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;healing-cannot-be-separated-from-the-gospel&#34;&gt;Healing cannot be separated from the Gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is undoubtedly true that God wants us to be thankful and
glorify Him whatever our circumstance (see for example Philippians
4:12-13) I do not believe God wants us to simply accept sickness or a
lack of healing as God&#39;s will. We should not simply pray and leave the
answer to God &amp;ndash; instead we need to learn from Jesus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their
synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; disease and sickness.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 9:35&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None went home sick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke says, &amp;ldquo;God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and
with power, who went about doing good and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;healing all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; who were
oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 10:38&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus viewed His mission as healing and deliverance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Go tell that fox, &amp;lsquo;I will drive out demons and heal people today and
tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.&#39;&amp;quot; (&lt;strong&gt;Luke 13:32&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing is how Jesus demonstrates and proclaims the Gospel. In God&amp;rsquo;s
Kingdom, darkness is driven out by light and sickness by healing. Jesus
commands us to repent and believe that His Kingdom has now come. Then He
commissions us to continue this proclamation &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and demonstration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
Jesus gives power and authority to &lt;em&gt;heal&lt;/em&gt;, not just to pray:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus had called the Twelve together, &lt;strong&gt;he gave them power and
authority&lt;/strong&gt; to drive out all demons and &lt;strong&gt;to cure diseases&lt;/strong&gt;, and he
sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and &lt;strong&gt;to heal the sick&lt;/strong&gt;.
(&lt;strong&gt;Luke 9:1&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel accounts do not allow us to separate healing from the Gospel.
We need be in no doubt that Jesus&#39; will is that we should continue the
proclamation of the Gospel of His Kingdom through healing and
deliverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;persisting-in-faith&#34;&gt;Persisting In Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to please God is to have bold, courageous faith in His
promises. We will never be reprimanded for too bold a faith!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You of little faith, why are you so afraid?&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;(Matt 8:26)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the face of persistent sickness we really struggle. We tend to
become fearful and anxious. Perhaps we give up praying for healing and
try to accept the sickness, but more often we end up pleading with God
to help us. Although this is completely understandable, and God
sympathises with us in our weakness, it really is not a good option!
Jesus says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that
they will be heard for their many words.&amp;quot; (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 6:7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Jesus tells us to keep praying in the assurance that God always
hears us and He answers speedily; and that those to keep on asking and
knocking and seeking will receive their request from their Father. (See
Luke 18:1-8 &amp;quot;Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they
should always pray and not give up...&amp;quot; and Matthew 7:7-11 - &amp;ldquo;Ask and
it will be given to you...&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may not understand why we need to keep praying, but it is NOT because
God is reluctant; we actually join in with God when we pray. Doubting is
a miserable pastime whereas there is such joy and peace in believing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom
15:13&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-up-again&#34;&gt;Getting Up Again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite definition of a righteous person is this, &amp;ldquo;He gets up
again.&amp;rdquo; It comes from this wonderful scripture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will look to the LORD, I will wait for the God of my salvation; my
God will hear me. Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I
shall rise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Micah 7:7-8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Repentance and Righteousness</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/repentance-and-righteousness/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/repentance-and-righteousness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;repentance-and-righteousness-stephen-dolley-dec-2018&#34;&gt;Repentance and Righteousness Stephen Dolley, Dec 2018&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in
order to observe your own traditions!&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Mark 7:9&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of studies aims to help us examine various crucial aspects
of our faith and practice to see if our traditions have led us to
setting aside the commands of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjects of repentance and righteousness often arouse strong
emotions amongst Christians because they are both foundational doctrines
but also because they touch us deeply; they relate to our deepest needs
of acceptance and self-worth. Leaders often have strong opinions about
the doctrinal aspects because they are trying to deal with church
members whose behaviour is sometimes troublesome. It is important,
therefore, that we examine scripture carefully and try to let it
instruct us, rather than simply try to justify our own beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study we will try to address two fundamental issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What and when do we need to confess and repent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When and how are we made righteous?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance has largely gone out of fashion in presenting the Gospel, in
reaction to the puritan preaching of fiery judgement: &amp;ldquo;Sinners in the
hands of an angry God&amp;rdquo;. It has been replaced by the appeal to God&amp;rsquo;s
love: &amp;ldquo;If only you knew just how passionately God loves you, you would
come running to His open arms&amp;rdquo;. A person responding to this gospel of
love is then typically encouraged to pray the &amp;ldquo;sinner&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; prayer, asking
for forgiveness for their imperfect character. They are then told that
they are forgiven and now have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are then taught that to continue to be forgiven we need to keep
confessing our sins and asking for forgiveness as often as we are aware
of having sinned &amp;ndash; keep short accounts with God. We are taught that we
are sinners, saved by grace and though we should slowly grow in
righteousness, we will inevitably repeatedly fail in our struggle
against temptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;salvation-repentance&#34;&gt;Salvation Repentance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do the scriptures teach about repentance for salvation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. &amp;ldquo;The time
has come,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and
believe the good news!&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Mark 1:15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to
all nations &lt;strong&gt;Luke 24:47&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out
&lt;strong&gt;Acts 3:19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;God has granted repentance that leads to life.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 11:18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see from these scriptures that repentance is to be preached as an
integral part of the Gospel and as a pre-requisite for salvation. But
what is not so obvious is the nature of that repentance. Mark&amp;rsquo;s quote
above points us in the right direction. The &amp;ldquo;good news&amp;rdquo; Jesus proclaimed
was &amp;ldquo;The time has come. The kingdom of God has come near.&amp;rdquo; The proper
response to that news is &amp;ldquo;Repent and believe that the time has come and
the kingdom of God has come near.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance for salvation concerns our belief about the Kingdom; it is
not focussed on our own imperfect nature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they
may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are
sanctified by faith in me.&#39; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 26:18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us
into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the
forgiveness of sins. &lt;strong&gt;Col 1:13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God&amp;rsquo;s
special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called
you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a
people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received
mercy, but now you have received mercy. &lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 2:9-10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance, which means to change direction, is about turning from
darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God, from the Kingdom of
darkness to the Kingdom of Jesus, from being &amp;ldquo;not a people&amp;rdquo; to becoming
a member of God&amp;rsquo;s people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biblical language of repentance for salvation. If we talk
instead about lying, cheating, being selfish and unkind, being lustful
or covetous, then we are directing people&amp;rsquo;s focus to their imperfect
character rather than to the kingdom of which they are an unwitting
part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telling someone they will one day have to face a judge to answer for
their wrong-doing may be true, but it does not direct a person to the
kind of repentance that is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person does not need to be convicted of their personal sinfulness to
be saved; they need to be convinced that their world-view is wrong. They
are on their life journey, doing their best to make progress towards a
better future. Then one day they meet someone who tells them they are
headed in the wrong direction. If they are convinced, they will be
hugely grateful! They will regret all the time and energy they have
spent heading in the wrong direction and turn round and start heading in
a new direction. Whether they are a great sinner or not is not
particularly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance for salvation is a change of world-view, a change in our
whole way of thinking. It is much more like changing political
affiliation, or emigrating to another land. Indeed it is a change of
religion &amp;ndash; from our former beliefs to believe that Jesus is
God-become-man to bring us to the righteous and loving Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sinner&amp;rsquo;s prayer, therefore, should not be &amp;ldquo;I have sinned. Please
forgive me&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;I have been heading in the wrong direction; going
along with the lies and deceit of the kingdom of this world. I want to
turn from all that and follow the light and truth of Jesus, God&amp;rsquo;s Son&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;salvation-forgiveness&#34;&gt;Salvation Forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen that salvation repentance is kingdom-sized. In the same
way, forgiveness is kingdom-sized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Acts 3:19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Col
1:13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation forgiveness is not concerned with individual sins, or our
imperfect character, but with sin as a barrier between us and God. All
our sins are wiped out; we receive forgiveness for all our sins, those
past and those future. All are forgiven for those who become children of
God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Acts
10:43&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being
made holy&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Heb 10:14,17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
sins, in accordance with the riches of God&#39;s grace&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;Ephesians
1:7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation forgiveness is a New-Covenant promise of God. God is no longer
sin-conscious towards those who are born again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fellowship-repentance&#34;&gt;Fellowship Repentance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having repented for salvation, been baptised in water and born again by
baptism in the Holy Spirit we are forever made righteous; cleansed and
forgiven for our sins. Christ Himself has become our righteousness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being
made holy&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Heb 10:14,17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from
God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption. &lt;strong&gt;1 Cor
1:30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might
become the righteousness of God in Him. &lt;strong&gt;2 Cor 5:21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing more that needs to be done for our sin. Jesus has
already done it all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he
will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to
those who are waiting for him. &lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 9:28&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are totally and forever forgiven as children of God, what is the
place of ongoing repentance and confession for a believer? Teaching
about confession for Christians is often based upon a misunderstanding
of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is
not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will
forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;1 John
1:8-9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this opening passage of his letter John is talking about the Gospel
he has proclaimed to them; the Gospel through which they were saved; the
Gospel that demands repentance from the kingdom of darkness to the
Kingdom of light (v5-7). Those who deny their need for repentance are
deceived, but those who confess their previous deception are made
righteous (v8-10). Thus 1 John 1:8-9 are about a person responding to
the Gospel and coming to faith; they are not instructions for believers
(see &amp;quot;If we confess our sins...&amp;quot; at the end of this document).
Instructions for believers come in the next chapter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father&amp;mdash;Jesus
Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;1 John 2:1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here there is no requirement for confession and repentance. We already
have a full-time advocate with the Father whose atoning sacrifice is
forever sufficient. We are not supposed to live with a continuing
reminder of our sin. As believers we live in the wonder of continuing
forgiveness because Jesus&#39; death was sufficient for us. We are now to
live in the joy of knowing that Jesus is our righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Rom 5:1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves
with Christ. &lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:27&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirits convicts unbelievers of sin, but His work for a
believer is to convict them of their righteousness in Christ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus &amp;hellip; You
have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
&lt;strong&gt;Rom 6:11,18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may
have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming. &lt;strong&gt;1 John
2:28&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every
power and authority. In him you were also circumcised with a
circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self, ruled by
the flesh, was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, having
been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with
him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the
dead. When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of
your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our
sins, having cancelled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which
stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to
the cross. &lt;strong&gt;Col 2:10-14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conscience can condemn us even though we know God does not. The
devil is the &amp;ldquo;Accuser of the brethren&amp;rdquo; (Rev 12:10). Paul warns us to
guard against the fiery darts of the evil one by wearing the breastplate
of righteousness (Eph 6:14). Whose righteousness do you suppose we wear?
Ours? No! It is Christ&amp;rsquo;s righteousness that we wear. The devil wants us
to be sin-conscious; God wants us to be Christ-conscious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on
things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set
your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and
your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your
life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. &lt;strong&gt;Col
3:1-4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel Teflon-coated clean? All-the-time clean? That your sin and
shortcomings do not and cannot make you dirty or give you a guilty
conscience? That you do not need to confess your sins to God in order to
draw near to him with joy and confidence? It is the work of the Holy
Spirit and our responsibility as disciples to convince ourselves of
these great biblical truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to know our sins are forgiven as a free gift, with nothing at
all for us to contribute. But in order for us to have a clean conscience
we also need to know that Christ is our righteousness. Our identity is
Christ, not mucky me. My conscience is his conscience, my confidence is
his confidence, my righteousness is his righteousness. We need to know
this, not simply as doctrinal truth, but as a felt reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not need to confess our sins and ask for forgiveness if we are
born again. If the Holy Spirit is living in us He changes our hearts so
that we do not want to sin. But if we do, &amp;ldquo;we have an advocate&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; John
tells us that when we belong to God and believe His truth, our hearts
will be at rest and not suffer from condemnation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our
hearts at rest in his presence: if our hearts condemn us, we know that
God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. Dear friends,
if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and
receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do
what pleases him. And this is his command: to believe in the name of
his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. The
one who keeps God&amp;rsquo;s commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is
how we know that he lives in us: we know it by the Spirit he gave us.
&lt;strong&gt;1 John 3:19-24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we naturally repent when the Holy Spirit does reveal sin to us,
sometimes we become hardened to our sin and it takes some more drastic
action from the Lord to confront us with our folly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons;
for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? ...but He
disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness. &amp;hellip;
afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. &lt;strong&gt;Heb
12:7-11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the
deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove
your lampstand out of its place &amp;mdash; unless you repent. &lt;strong&gt;Rev. 2:5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holiness matters because we have turned away from darkness to Light and
we want to walk in the light and truth. We want to enjoy fellowship with
the Holy Spirit and with one another. We will want to talk to God about
the areas where we fall short of God&amp;rsquo;s glory because we will want His
help to grow more like Christ. We are likely to confess our short
comings and thank Him for His grace and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with seeing repentance as a daily requirement for dealing
with sinful acts is that it encourages us to see our relationship with
God as being performance-based. It feeds unbelief, self-righteousness
and tends to make us compare ourselves with others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? &amp;hellip; Are you so foolish?
After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish
by means of the flesh? &amp;hellip; Abraham &amp;ldquo;believed God, and it was credited
to him as righteousness.&amp;rdquo; Understand, then, that those who have faith
are children of Abraham. &lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin consciousness stifles our growth. It hinders our fellowship with
God. It leaves us with a tainted conscience which makes us feel dirty
and unable to approach God with confidence. The boast of the New
Covenant over the Old is that it gives us a clear conscience (at least
it should do!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Covenant sacrifices were not able to clear the conscience of
the worshipper &amp;hellip; How much more, then, will the blood of Christ &amp;hellip;
cleanse our consciences from dead works so that we may serve the
living God! &amp;hellip; Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with
the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to
cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with
pure water. &lt;strong&gt;Heb 9:9, 14, 10:22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fellowship-forgiveness&#34;&gt;Fellowship Forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a place for repentance, confession and asking for forgiveness:
in our relationships with each other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;forgive our sins as we forgive others&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Matt 6:12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one
another, that you may be healed.&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;James 5:16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin creates barriers and difficulties between believers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship
with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us
from all sin. &lt;strong&gt;1 John 1:7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault
between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your
brother. &lt;strong&gt;Matt 18:15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have turned from the kingdom of darkness to the Kingdom of Light,
we will want to walk in light and truth with one another. We will want
to deal with any relationship issues that arise between us and we will
be gracious and merciful in response to the grace and mercy we have
received from Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just
as in Christ God forgave you. &lt;strong&gt;Eph 4:32&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, as God&amp;rsquo;s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe
yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and
patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you
has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
&lt;strong&gt;Col 3:12-13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discipleship&#34;&gt;Discipleship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipleship is about believing God, trusting His promises and living
out the life of confident faith He calls us to. For us to do this, we
need to be far more conscious of Christ in us than sin in us. Constant
reminders of our sin do nothing to help us move in the power of the Holy
Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look over the scriptures quoted in this study and ask yourself &amp;ldquo;What is
the Spirit trying to convince me of?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to fix our eyes on Jesus, His righteousness, His indwelling
presence, His favour, His promises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with
power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell
in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and
established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord&amp;rsquo;s holy
people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of
Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge&amp;mdash;that you may
be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. Now to him who is
able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to
his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and
in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.
&lt;strong&gt;Eph 3:16-21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-we-confess-our-sins&#34;&gt;If we confess our sins...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John&#39;s use of the word &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;If we confess our sins...&amp;quot;(1 John
1v9) has led many to think that John is saying that Christians should
confess their sins. But if we follow John&#39;s argument through, and
notice how he uses &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; then we can see he must be talking about
unbelievers coming to faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From vv1-5 John clearly means himself and his fellow apostles when he
uses &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;. But in v6 he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the
darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, John cannot possibly be meaning himself when he writes &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;. He
is using &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; to imagine himself in the shoes of an unbeliever. In v7
he continues to imagine himself as that unbeliever coming into the light
of the Gospel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies
us from all sin.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In v8 and v10 it is again clear that he uses &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; to imagine an
unbeliever, but this time one who rejects the light:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is
not in us.&amp;quot; ... &amp;quot;If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to
be a liar and his word is not in us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that leaves us with the &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; in v9:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us
our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is John meaning by &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;? Well, in both the preceding and following
sentences he clearly means an unbeliever who has encountered the Gospel
of Light &amp;ndash; one who either accepts or rejects the message. It makes no
sense at all for John to suddenly be talking about Christians at this
point. It is obviously the same people he has in mind since v6:
unbelievers encountering the Gospel who either reject the idea that they
are sinners in need of forgiveness, or who confess their need to Jesus
and turn to Him for saving forgiveness. V9 is about what happens when a
person comes out of darkness into the light. Chapter 2 is about living
as a believer. There, the answer to our ongoing sin is the eternal
advocacy and sufficiency of Jesus - see especially 2:1-2 and 2:12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion, this famous passage in John&#39;s letter is NOT an
instruction to believers to keep confessing their sin, but an
instruction to unbelievers coming to faith. God does not want us to keep
remembering our sin. He has forgiven it. He wants us to remember and
celebrate Christ who is our righteousness &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Set your minds on things
above, not on things below&amp;quot; Colossians 3:1-3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Righteousness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Originally published in &lt;em&gt;New Dictionary of Theology&lt;/em&gt;.  David F. Wright,
Sinclair B. Ferguson, J.I. Packer (eds), 590-592.  IVP.  Reproduced by
permission of the author.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righteousness.  The basic meaning of &amp;lsquo;righteousness&amp;rsquo; and its cognates in
the Bible derives from the Hebrew &lt;em&gt;sedeq&lt;/em&gt;, which was usually translated
in the LXX as &lt;em&gt;dikaiosynē&lt;/em&gt;. It thus denotes not so much the abstract
idea of justice or virtue, as right standing and consequent right
behaviour, within a community.  English translates this semantic field
with two different roots: &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;righteous&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;righteousness&amp;rsquo; and
&amp;lsquo;just&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;justice&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;justify&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;justification&amp;rsquo;.  In Heb. and Gk.,
however, these ideas all belong together linguistically and
theologically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the OT (upon which the NT idea is based) two fields of thought give
specific shape to the idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawcourt setting gives &amp;lsquo;righteousness&amp;rsquo; the idea of the standing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of a person in relation to the court&amp;rsquo;s decision.In the Hebrew
court there were no public prosecutors: all cases had to be
brought by a plaintiff against a defendant.  Righteousness is the
status which results, for either party, if the court finds in his
favour.  Since the standard of judgment is the covenant law of
God, &amp;lsquo;righteousness&amp;rsquo; can acquire the sense of &amp;lsquo;behaviour in
conformity with the covenant requirements&amp;rsquo;, bringing about the
possibility that right covenant standing can be observed in
ordinary behaviour.  In addition, the judge, or king, must conform
to a different sense of righteousness: he must try cases fairly,
i.e. he must be true to the law and/or the covenant, must condemn
evil, show no partiality, and uphold the cause of the
defenceless.  This complex meaning explains the occasional
instances when the Septuagint uses &lt;em&gt;dikaiosynē&lt;/em&gt; to translate
not &lt;em&gt;sedeq&lt;/em&gt; and its cognates but other roots such
as &lt;em&gt;hesed&lt;/em&gt; (grace, covenant mercy), &lt;em&gt;mišpāt&lt;/em&gt; (judgment,
justice), &lt;em&gt;etc&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenantal setting merges with that of the lawcourt: this is due&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;partly to the fact that the law (Torah) is the covenant
charter.Though sometimes God himself is seen as Israel&amp;rsquo;s adversary
at law, the more frequently encountered picture is of God as judge
or king, with Israel as either plaintiff (pleading her cause
against her enemies) or defendant (on trial for failure to keep
the covenant).  God&amp;rsquo;s righteousness is then invoked as the reason
why he can be expected to deliver his people: he is committed by
covenant to do so.  When this is apparently called into question
(in the exile, and later in the Maccabean revolt and the fall of
Jerusalem in AD 70), the writers of these periods reply that God
is righteous in judging his sinful people; that he is righteous in
waiting before judging their enemies, granting time for
repentance; and that he will show himself righteous in restoring
the: fortunes of his people, in renewing the covenant (Dn. 9; Ezr.
9; etc.).  The book of Job can be seen as a long lawcourt scene in
which Job pleads his righteousness, imagining that God is his
adversary, only to discover that God cannot be brought into court:
the first two chapters reveal Satan (see Devil) as the real
prosecutor, with Job&amp;rsquo;s comforters as his unwitting assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two settings (lawcourt and covenant) combine to produce the
developed covenantal theology which underlay Judaism at the time of
Jesus.  To have &amp;lsquo;righteousness&amp;rsquo; meant to belong to the covenant, the
boundary marker of which was the Torah, and the hope of which was that
God, in accordance with his own righteousness, would act in history to
&amp;lsquo;vindicate&amp;rsquo;, to &amp;lsquo;justify&amp;rsquo;, his people (i.e. to show that they really
were his people) by saving them from their enemies.  These meanings are
reflected particularly in Matthew, where &amp;lsquo;righteousness&amp;rsquo; is shorthand
both for the saving plan of God (Mt. 3:15) and for the covenantal
obligations of his people (5:20; 6:1), and Luke, which emphasizes the
&amp;lsquo;righteous&amp;rsquo; standing of many of the key actors in the drama (Lk. 1:6;
2:25; 23:50; Acts 10:22).  Jesus himself is sometimes called &amp;lsquo;the
righteous one&amp;rsquo;, in virtue of his being the one designated by God as his
true covenant partner (e.g. Acts 3:14; 7:52, 22:14, Jas. 5:6).  The
Jewish belief that God would judge the world justly is echoed repeatedly
in the NT, e.g. 2 Thes. 1:5-6; Rom. 2:1-16; Heb. 12:23.  But the fullest
development comes in Paul, particularly with his exposition in Romans of
the righteousness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul saw that the Jewish problem of God&amp;rsquo;s righteousness (if the creator
of the world is Israel&amp;rsquo;s covenant God, why is Israel still oppressed?)
had been answered in a new and striking way in the death and
resurrection of Jesus Christ.  The answer had, in fact, forced a
restatement of the question, demonstrating as it did the universal
sinfulness of Jews as well as pagans.  The gospel, Paul declares, proves
that God is in the right despite appearances: he has kept covenant with
Abraham, has dealt properly with sin, has acted and will act without
partiality, and upholds all those who cast themselves, helpless, on his
mercy (Rom. 1:16-17; 2:1-16; 3:21 &amp;ndash; 4:25).  God has, in other words,
shown &amp;lsquo;righteousness&amp;rsquo; in the sense appropriate for the judge and the
Lord of the covenant.  He is thus able to anticipate the verdict of the
last day (Rom. 2:1-16) and to declare in the present (Rom. 3:21-26) that
all who believe the gospel are already within the covenant community
(see Justification).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view that &amp;lsquo;the righteousness of God&amp;rsquo; refers to a righteousness which
God gives to, bestows upon, or recognizes in human beings came initially
from Augustine, but gained its force (in terms of the development of
modern theology) from Luther&amp;rsquo;s reaction against a &lt;em&gt;iustitia
distributiva&lt;/em&gt;. The term &lt;em&gt;iustitia&lt;/em&gt;, as found in the Latin Vulgate, had
indeed pulled the understanding of texts such as Rom. 1:17 in the
(false) direction of a merely &amp;lsquo;distributive&amp;rsquo; justice, in which God
simply rewards virtue and punishes vice.  Luther&amp;rsquo;s alternative, however
fruitful in opening new worlds of theology to him, was in some ways
equally misleading, for it directed attention away from the biblical
notion of God&amp;rsquo;s covenant faithfulness and instead placed greater
emphasis upon the status of the human being.  In the period after
Luther, Protestant theology largely returned to the notion of the
distributive justice of God: because God is righteous, he must in fact
reward virtue and punish sin, and this satisfaction of divine justice
took place in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the NT, the people of God do indeed have &amp;lsquo;righteousness&amp;rsquo;. 
This is not, strictly speaking, God&amp;rsquo;s own righteousness (though cf. 2
Cor. 5:21), but that which is proper to the person in whose favour the
court has found; within the covenant context, it is the right standing
of a member of the people of God.  &amp;lsquo;Righteousness&amp;rsquo; thus comes to mean,
more or less, &amp;lsquo;covenant membership&amp;rsquo;, with all the overtones of
appropriate behaviour (e.g. Phil. 1:11).  The terminology plays a
central role in Paul&amp;rsquo;s debate with those who sought to keep the covenant
community within the bounds of physical Judaism: they, Paul says, are
ignorant of God&amp;rsquo;s righteousness (i.e. of what God is righteously
accomplishing, of how he is fulfilling his covenant) and are seeking to
establish a righteousness of their own (i.e. a covenant membership for
Jews alone), whereas in God&amp;rsquo;s plan Christ offers covenant membership to
all who believe the gospel (Rom. 10:3-4).  (See further Paul.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central biblical discussions of righteousness thus principally
concern membership in the covenant and the behaviour appropriate to that
membership.  Since, however, these passages depend on a theology in
which God is creator and judge of all the earth, and in which God&amp;rsquo;s
people are to reflect God&amp;rsquo;s own character, it is not illegitimate to
extrapolate from them to the &amp;lsquo;justice&amp;rsquo; which God desires, and designs,
for his world. The church is to be not only an example of God&amp;rsquo;s intended
new humanity, but the means by which the eventual plan, including the
establishment of world-wide justice, is to be put into effect.  Lack of
emphasis here in older theological writing, due sometimes to
individualism and sometimes to a dualistic split between church and
world, has led to a reaction (e.g. in some liberation theology) in which
&amp;lsquo;justice&amp;rsquo; as an abstract virtue has been elevated in an unbiblical
manner (e.g. at the expense of mercy).  This should not prevent a
balanced orthodox view of world-wide justice from regaining, and
retaining, its place in the church&amp;rsquo;s teaching and practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deft artistry and fathomless theology of John&amp;rsquo;s gospel is powerfully
displayed in the footwashing scene in chapter 13. In a few strokes of
the pen we are offered a tableau intimate and touching on the one hand
and scary and dangerous on the other. Having begun his masterpiece with
the all-creative Word becoming flesh and revealing God&amp;rsquo;s glory &amp;ndash; we
shall return to his Prologue in a little while &amp;ndash; John begins the
shorter second half of his gospel with an acted parable of the same
thing. Jesus removes his outer garments and kneels down to wash the
disciples&#39; feet, summing up all that is to come in the astonishing act
of divine humility, of loving redemption, of cleansing for service. This
is a good place to begin this evening&amp;rsquo;s quest for a fresh glimpse of
what we in the Western churches have traditionally called &amp;lsquo;the
atonement&amp;rsquo;, my subject for tonight. For John, as indeed throughout the
New Testament, Jesus&#39; vocation to rescue the world from its plight and
in so doing to reveal the divine glory in action is focused, symbolized,
encoded in an action simultaneously dramatic, fraught with cosmic
significance, and gentle, tender with human emotion. If you want to
understand the great mysteries of Christian theology, of Trinity,
Incarnation, and atonement itself, you could do worse than spend time
with this scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Having loved his own who were in the world&amp;rsquo;, John begins, &amp;lsquo;Jesus loved
them to the end, to the uttermost&amp;rsquo;. Here we see what it means that &amp;lsquo;God
so loved the world that he gave his only son&amp;rsquo;: a love at once powerful,
humble, sovereign and sensitive. As always, Jesus surprises his
followers, as he was to do even more devastatingly at the climax of the
story the following day. Peter tries to object &amp;ndash; a Johannine
equivalent, in a sense, of Peter&amp;rsquo;s protest in Matthew 16 &amp;ndash; and Jesus
waves away the objection: If I don&amp;rsquo;t wash you, he says, you have no part
in me. This produces a typically Petrine over-reaction: well then, says
Peter, not my feet only, but my hands and my head. Calm down, says
Jesus: you are already clean, because I have washed you, and all you now
need is the regular footwashing &amp;ndash; a wonderful image in itself of the
prior whole-person washing of the gospel itself, needing only the
regular smaller-scale washing of dusty feet, but like everything else in
John&amp;rsquo;s story pointing forwards to the great saving act to come in which
the filth and mire of the centuries would be washed away in the torrent
of water and blood. And then Jesus resumes his garments and explains at
least the surface layer of meaning: as I have done this to you, you
should do it for one another. As usual John gives the simple explanation
in order to nudge his readers into the deeper ones, but this already
points forward to the ministries of the gospel which will be unleashed
through the outpoured Spirit in John 20: As the Father sent me, so I
send you. Atonement then; atonement now. The theology of the cross is
only ultimately complete when it issues in the footwashing and
fruitbearing mission of Jesus&#39; followers. That is part of the point of
the long discourses which follow chapter 13 and thereby prepare the way
for the dramatic scene before Pilate and on the cross itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into this scene of prophetic action and symbolic power John has woven
the dark strand which explains &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; all this is necessary and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the
great redemption is to be accomplished. The accuser, he says, had
already put it into Judas&amp;rsquo;s heart to betray Jesus. The accuser &amp;ndash; the
satan &amp;ndash; is the dark, sub-personal force that has dogged Jesus&#39;
footsteps throughout his mission, rather as Gollum is never far away
while Frodo and his companions undertake their fateful journey; and,
indeed, I rather think Tolkein was tracking a profound biblical theme in
that strand of his master-narrative, including its final denouement.
Jesus knows of course that the satan would do this, and had already
hinted that one of his own followers would act out the great Accusation,
the charge that would take him to his death. It isn&amp;rsquo;t just that Judas is
succumbing to a miscellaneous temptation; rather, the hate and shame of
all the world, the raging howl that rises from all the accumulated
forces of evil, of anti-creation, of tyranny and spite and sneering and
lies, has gathered itself into one and has focused its deadly spotlight
on the enfleshed Word, the living embodiment of the loving and wise
creator. And love only makes it worse; it is &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the footwashing,
where Jesus warns that &amp;lsquo;you are already clean, though not all of you&amp;rsquo;,
that the satan finally enters into Judas. &amp;lsquo;Do it quickly,&amp;rsquo; says Jesus;
and Judas goes out into the night. People sometimes say that St Luke was
an artist; but if ever a biblical scene had all the elements of a great
canvas, holding many different characters and moods within a single
tableau, it is this footwashing scene in John 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begin with this scene partly because, knowing it will be impossible in
one lecture to say very much of what I have tried to say in the book
(which turned out to be much longer than I had expected or intended), I
want at least to stir your imaginations so that your reflection on
Jesus&#39; crucifixion is not a matter of theories, of schemes of thought to
be played off against one another, but a matter of vivid historical
reality captured in a story like the footwashing, as indeed in so many
others, but with this one positioned with deliberate care by John to
launch the final moves that will take us to the foot of the cross, and
on, beyond, to the fresh morning in the garden and the warm breath of
the outpoured Spirit. We will come presently and briefly to the
theories, but the theories mean what they mean as interpretations of the
story, the real-life narrative of the word made flesh, of the flesh made
shameful, of the shame itself killed and buried. The theories are
battered little signposts pointing towards that reality, and the gospels
are written not to provide lively illustrations of those theories but to
name and invoke the reality towards which they point. When Jesus wanted
to explain to his followers what his death would mean he didn&amp;rsquo;t give
them a theory, he gave them a &lt;em&gt;meal&lt;/em&gt; on the one hand and a &lt;em&gt;dramatic
action&lt;/em&gt; on the other. The Word became &lt;em&gt;flesh&lt;/em&gt;, and it is in flesh &amp;ndash; his
flesh, and then, worryingly, our flesh &amp;ndash; that the truth is revealed.
God forgive us that we have answered rationalistic scepticism with
rationalistic fideism. The &lt;em&gt;Word&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; the Logos, the ultimate Reason in
Person &amp;ndash; became &lt;em&gt;flesh&lt;/em&gt;, and it is in the flesh that the world was
saved; it is in the flesh that the glory was and is revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, when we pan back from John 13 and see this tableau within the
larger context of the fourth Gospel as a whole, we quickly discover that
the whole book is about the revelation of the divine glory precisely in
the salvation of the world, and that the way to understand these large
abstractions is to see them within the vast and sprawling story of
Israel and the world as set out in scripture. Richard Hays, the great
contemporary American New Testament scholar, has once again put us in
his debt with his new book, &lt;em&gt;Echoes of Scripture in the Gospels&lt;/em&gt;; but
even Hays would admit, I think, that there is far more still to be said
about the ways in which the story of scripture resonates through all
four gospels, particularly in their portrayal of the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, John positively urges us in his prologue to see the whole
of the story he will tell within the long reach of the first two books
of the Bible. John, after all, focuses his story again and again on the
Temple, on Jesus&#39; upstaging of the Temple, on his implicit warning to
the Temple and its guardians, and on his final performance of that which
the Temple itself could not effect. And what has that to do with Genesis
and Exodus? Well, everything: because Genesis 1 and 2 describe, to
anyone with first-century eyes, the construction of the ultimate Temple,
the single heaven-and-earth reality, the one Cosmos within which the
twin realities of God&amp;rsquo;s space and our space are held together in proper
balance and mutual relation. The seven stages of creation are the seven
stages of constructing a temple, into which the builder will come to
take up residence, to take his &amp;lsquo;rest&amp;rsquo;: Here is Zion, my resting-place,
says Israel&amp;rsquo;s God in the Psalms. And within this Temple there is of
course, as the final element of construction, the Image: the true Image
through which the rest of creation sees and worships the creator, the
true Image through which the sovereign and loving creator becomes
present to, in and with his creation, working out his purposes. Genesis
1 declares that the God who made the world is the heaven-and-earth God,
the working-through-humans-in-the-world God. (I wish there was a word
for that; it might be easier in German; or perhaps we could take the
Greek and speak not just of an &lt;em&gt;anthropic&lt;/em&gt; God, a God who was
appropriately bodied forth in human life, but a &lt;em&gt;dianthropic&lt;/em&gt; God, a God
who desired to express himself perfectly by working &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; humans in
the world.) And already, with this vision of Genesis before us, we
understand both the beginning and the climax of John&amp;rsquo;s gospel: &lt;em&gt;in the
beginning&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;en arche&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bereshith&lt;/em&gt;: in the beginning was the Word . . .
and the Word became flesh. And on the last Friday, the ultimate sixth
day of the week, the representative of the world&amp;rsquo;s ruler declares
&amp;lsquo;behold the Man&amp;rsquo;: like Caiaphas earlier, Pontius Pilate says far, far
more than he knows, acknowledging that Jesus is the Proper Man, the true
Image, the one at whom, when people gaze, they see the Father; the one
through whom the Father is present, and powerfully working, to bring
about his desire and design. And in the end, when the light has shone in
the gathering darkness and the darkness has tried to extinguish it, the
final word echoes Genesis once more: &lt;em&gt;tetelestai&lt;/em&gt;, it is finished. The
work is accomplished. There follows the rest of the seventh day, the
rest in the tomb, before the first day of the new week when Mary
Magdalene comes to the garden and discovers that new creation has begun.
John is writing a new Genesis, and the death of Jesus places at the
heart of this new heaven-and-earth reality the sign and symbol of the
Image through which the world will see and recognise its Creator and
know him as the God of unstoppable love, the sign and symbol of the
Image through which the Creator has established that love at the climax
of world history and as the fountain-head for the rivers of living water
that will now flow out to refresh and renew his whole world. That is the
primary story John is telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if it is a new Genesis it is also a new Exodus. For years, when
reading Exodus, I confess that I used to misjudge what Moses says
repeatedly to Pharaoh: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in
the desert. I used to think this was just an excuse: we want to go home
to our promised land, but let&amp;rsquo;s just tell Pharaoh that we want to
worship our God and that we can&amp;rsquo;t do it in his land, surrounded by his
gods. But the whole logic of the book of Exodus, and indeed of the
Pentateuch as a whole, forbids that interpretation. If you read Exodus
at a run you will easily arrive at Mount Sinai in chapter 20; up to that
point it&amp;rsquo;s a page-turner, one dramatic incident after another, but then
suddenly the pace seems to slacken as we get miscellaneous rules and
regulations, though not (to be honest) very many of them yet. Don&amp;rsquo;t stop
there; forge ahead; because the whole narrative is indeed moving swiftly
forward to the aim and object of the whole thing, which is the
restoration of creation itself, the purpose for which God called Abraham
and his family in the first place, the purpose through which heaven and
earth will be joined together once more, only now in dramatic symbol and
onward pointing sign. The giving of Torah itself is just a preparation;
what matters is the Tabernacle. The Tabernacle is the &lt;em&gt;microcosmos&lt;/em&gt;, the
little world, the heaven-and-earth place, the mysterious, untameable,
moving tent &amp;ndash; or perhaps it is the world that moves, while the tent
stays still? &amp;ndash; in which the living God will come to dwell, to
tabernacle, in the midst of his people, in the pillar of cloud by day
and fire by night. The whole of the book of Exodus is itself moving
towards this moment, in chapter 40, when the Tent is set up, constructed
and decorated with the highest human artistry, which itself is part of
the point, and the Divine Glory comes to dwell in it, so that even Moses
couldn&amp;rsquo;t enter the Tent because of that glorious presence. Exodus 40
answers to Genesis 1 and 2: creation is renewed, heaven and earth are
held together, the world itself is halted from its slide back towards
chaos, and the people of God, tent-makers and tent-keepers and pilgrims
wherever the glory-filled Tent will lead them, are to live the dangerous
and challenging life of the people in whose midst there dwells, in
strange humble sovereignty, the promise and hope for the whole of
creation. (This is course is why Leviticus is where it is and what it
is, with the priests as the humans who stand at the intersection of
heaven and earth; but that&amp;rsquo;s another story.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this and much more &amp;ndash; think of Solomon&amp;rsquo;s Temple in 1 Kings 8,
think of the vision in Isaiah 6 &amp;ndash; is then poured by John into the dense
and world-shaping reality of the Prologue as it reaches its climax. In
the beginning was the Word; &lt;em&gt;and the Word became flesh, and tabernacled
among us; and we gazed upon his glory&lt;/em&gt;. We have been allowed where Moses
was not. We have seen the glory, the heaven-and-earth reality, the
human &lt;em&gt;microcosmos&lt;/em&gt;, the Tent where the God of the Exodus is revealed as
the One God of creation and new creation. The Exodus through which
creation is rescued and renewed; the new creation which comes to birth
on the eighth day after the dark power, the great and terrible Pharaoh,
has been defeated once and for all. This is the story that John is
telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of course it isn&amp;rsquo;t just Genesis and Exodus, and indeed Genesis
and Exodus themselves indicate well enough that things are going to be
anything but straightforward. Genesis 1 and 2 of course give way to the
whispering serpent, the first murder, and the long decline into human
arrogance which ends with the tower of Babel. Eden and Babylon, like
Jesus and Judas at the Supper, frame the action which follows, as
Abraham and his family are called to a stupendous vocation and come
repeatedly within a whisker of throwing it all away; as the children of
Israel, gloriously rescued and on their way to their promised
inheritance, make a golden calf at the very moment when the
true &lt;em&gt;microcosmos&lt;/em&gt; was about to be constructed among them, so that Moses
has to engage in frantic verbal fisticuffs with God to prevent him
aborting the entire operation. (Don&amp;rsquo;t you love the way that conversation
goes? God says to Moses, &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Your&lt;/em&gt; people, whom &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; brought out of
Egypt, have rebelled, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to destroy them&amp;rsquo;; and Moses shoots
right back with &amp;lsquo;Actually, they are &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; people, and &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; brought
them out of Egypt, and it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; reputation that&amp;rsquo;s on the line here.&#39;)
But as the Pentateuch unwinds to its dark and puzzling conclusion it
becomes clear that the people of God, the tent-keepers if you like, are
still in themselves a rebellious people who will themselves have to
suffer the fate of all those who put other Images at the intersection of
heaven and earth. They will go into exile, not despite the fact that
they are the covenant people but precisely because of that dangerous
reality. God will fill his creation with his glory but it will come
through the casting away and the receiving back of his tent-keepers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis and Exodus, then, give us the structure, the framework. God will
rescue and restore his heaven-and-earth creation, and the Tabernacle is
the sign and seal of that promise, with Aaron and his sons as the
image-reflectors to hold that hope together and Israel as a whole the
royal priesthood for the whole of creation. Genesis to Deuteronomy give
us the story, stretching forward in its final chapters to embrace the
whole period of kings and prophets, of exile and restoration. The kings,
themselves of course a deeply ambiguous lot, are nevertheless called to
be image-bearers, to be the spearhead &amp;ndash; the metaphor is not too harsh
&amp;ndash; of YHWH&amp;rsquo;s victory over the powers of evil, to be the focus of his
reign of justice and peace. Or so it seemed, until kings and priests
alike fail miserably. The prophets, particularly Isaiah and Ezekiel, see
the glory of God and the shame of Israel in severe counterpoint, with
the consequence that the shame is complete and the glory departs. But
Ezekiel then describes the creation of the new Temple, with Ezekiel 43
corresponding to Exodus 40 as the divine glory returns at last. And
Isaiah, in his gospel of comfort, describes the scene of majesty in
which the sovereign God comes back with the mountains flattened and the
valleys filled in for his glory to be revealed for all flesh to witness
it; and the majesty is joined with gentle intimacy, exactly as in John
13, as he will feed his flock like a shepherd, gather the lambs in his
arms, and gently lead the mother sheep. A new Exodus, in other words:
the great prophetic theme which stretches like a long question-mark over
the four hundred years after exile in Babel until a voice in the
wilderness declares that the time has come. King, temple, new exodus,
new creation; the themes come rushing together. Jesus chose Passover as
the moment to do what had to be done, the moment he knew would awaken
precisely those biblical resonances which would appropriately frame his
final kingdom-bringing action and passion. The gospel writers, following
this foundational insight, tell the story of Jesus as the story of the
strange new Exodus in which the glory returns at last, in a form nobody
had seen coming. No wonder Caiaphas and his cronies were alarmed. Their
priestly role, standing between heaven and earth, was about to be
upstaged once and for all and for ever by the true Image, the Word made
flesh, who would sum up in himself the long-delayed obedience of Israel
on the one hand and the long-awaited return of Israel&amp;rsquo;s God on the
other. When St Paul, quoting the early Christian formula, says that the
Messiah died for our sins &amp;lsquo;in accordance with the scriptures&amp;rsquo;, it is
this complex narrative, full of doom and glory, which he has in mind.
Proof-texts are for the birds (or, more accurately, for the
neo-Marcionite rationalists); what matters is the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both John and Paul draw out one theme in particular from Exodus, from
Isaiah, from the entire earlier narrative. Babel must be overthrown if
Abraham&amp;rsquo;s people are to inherit the world. Pharaoh must be overthrown if
Abraham&amp;rsquo;s family are to be rescued. Babylon and its gods must be
overthrown if the new Exodus is to be accomplished. All of this the
prophets see, particularly again Isaiah for whom God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom will be
established through the overthrow of the dark power and the redeeming
return of YHWH to Zion. And all of this is retrieved by the gospel
writers, and particularly John, as he leads the eye up from his prologue
all the way through to the footwashing scene and on to the cross. Jesus&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;signs&amp;rsquo;, starting with the wedding at Cana (itself of course symbolizing
the marriage of heaven and earth), reveal his glory; and the sequence of
signs leads us, if we follow the clues John is leaving us, all the way
to the cross itself where the dark glory of God is revealed as the glory
of the true Image, the priest, the king, the lover. And this theme,
picked up in the footwashing scene as we saw with Judas embodying the
satan, is already highlighted as John draws together the first half of
his gospel in chapter 12, where he quotes precisely those passages from
Isaiah in which the themes I have been sketching come to sharp
expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial passage &amp;ndash; John 12.20-36 &amp;ndash; begins with a typical piece of
Johannine puzzlement. Some Greeks come to the feast, and want to see
Jesus. But instead of arranging a time later that day when they could
sit down for a coffee together, Jesus proceeds to speak in riddles. This
is the sign, he seems to be saying, that the hour has come for the Son
of Man to be glorified, for the grain of wheat to fall into the earth
and die in order to bear much fruit. What on earth has that got to do
with these poor Greeks who simply want to see him? Jesus looks beyond
the immediate request to the ultimate purpose. The world upon which he
looks out &amp;ndash; the pagan world, and also tragically the Jewish world &amp;ndash; is
in the grip of the Pharaoh, the dark Babel-gods, &amp;lsquo;the ruler of this
world&amp;rsquo;. There is no point simply having a chat with these Greeks here
and now. What matters is not understanding the world, but rescuing it.
This is the time for God&amp;rsquo;s name to be glorified, for judgment to be
passed on the world: &amp;lsquo;Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler
of this world is to be cast out; and when I am lifted up from the earth,
I will draw all people to myself&amp;rsquo;. Here we have it. Jesus&#39; death will be
the means by which &amp;ndash; in a moment of shocking and intense paradox,
picked up by all the New Testament writers in their own ways &amp;ndash; the
power that has gripped the world of Greek and Jew alike will be
overthrown by the greater power, the power the world never imagined, the
power of a love which loves its own and loves them to the end. In John&amp;rsquo;s
gospel there are two things which cannot happen until Jesus has died &amp;ndash;
apart, of course, from the resurrection itself and with it the launch of
the new creation. First, in chapter 7, the Spirit cannot be poured out
through and out of the hearts of the disciples until Jesus is
&amp;lsquo;glorified&amp;rsquo;. Now here in chapter 12 the dark power which has held the
whole world in its grip must be defeated before it makes any sense for
the Greeks to come and see Jesus, to hold him perhaps within their world
of theory when what matters is the world of the new temple, the new
cosmos, the ultimate Image, the word made flesh. Jesus&#39; death will be
the overthrow of the Power, the &amp;lsquo;ruler of this world&amp;rsquo;. That is why the
long scene in chapters 18 and 19, of Jesus in sharp dialogue with
Pontius Pilate, the kingdom of God against the kingdom of Caesar, is so
vital to the whole meaning of the story. Pilate asks about kingdom, and
Jesus replies about truth; Pilate doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what truth is, because
the only truth he knows is the power to kill. All power, says Jesus,
comes from above. And what he doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain, because like the Greeks
Pilate just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get it, is that the ultimate power is the
footwashing power, the power of radical, transformative love. And on the
cross, as John makes clear, that love goes to work, with the tender
moment with Mary and John on the one hand and on the other Pilate
himself, despite himself, declaring &amp;lsquo;what I have written I have
written&amp;rsquo;, the ruler of this world declaring unwittingly that Jesus is
indeed the King of the Jews, and hence, according to the Psalms and the
prophets, the ultimate ruler and justice-bringer for the whole
world. &lt;em&gt;Tetelestai&lt;/em&gt;, it is finished: the new tabernacle, the new
creation, rescued from the wreck of the old, through the king who is
also the Passover lamb whose bones remain unbroken. New Exodus; real
return from exile; return of YHWH to Zion; messianic enthronement;
priestly work complete; creation ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven.
My friends, please don&amp;rsquo;t ever think of trying to construct something
called an &amp;lsquo;atonement-theology&amp;rsquo; unless you know, with John, what it means
that the Messiah died for our sins &lt;em&gt;in accordance with the scriptures&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of course we have tried &amp;ndash; the western tradition has tried &amp;ndash; to
do it in many other ways. We have told many different stories, so that
Israel&amp;rsquo;s scriptures become merely a source-book for random prophecies to
be fitted into the redemption-narratives we have gleaned from other
cultures. We have then distorted those texts themselves to play the role
demanded by these other narratives: narratives of divine honour
offended, of divine lawcourt sitting in judgment, of human muddle and
mistake. All of these matter but if we start with them we will skew the
whole. &amp;lsquo;Atonement&amp;rsquo; itself &amp;ndash; the word is far less precise than we
normally imagine &amp;ndash; must include so much more, including the notions of
sacrifice, which itself demands that we stop not at the cross but with
the Ascension where, according to Hebrews, the Son offers his
once-for-all sacrifice in the heavenly temple. And all these ideas can
themselves be distorted, and have themselves been distorted, as we have
put them into our different frameworks. In particular, we have radically
misread the entire sacrificial tradition of ancient Israel, in which
animals were not subjected to a vicarious death penalty but were killed
so that their blood, itself a gift from God, would cleanse the sanctuary
to maintain the heaven-and-earth reality in the midst of an as yet
unredeemed world. Passover itself was not an atoning sacrifice. The only
animal that has sins confessed over its head is the only animal in the
Levitical rituals that does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; get killed: the scapegoat is driven
away, bearing Israel&amp;rsquo;s sins into the wilderness. And, as I try to
explain in the book, the much-cherished and heavily guarded statements
of atonement theology that we all learned from the sixteenth-century
reformers, though vital as a bulwark against error, were themselves
framed far more in terms of the late mediaeval ideas, particularly of
purgatory and the mass, to which the reformers were reacting. The
reformers were doing the noble job of trying to give biblical answers to
fifteenth-century questions. Fine: but the Bible itself upon which they
rightly insisted itself makes it clear that this is not enough. We must
get inside the world of the Bible, must understand what it means that
the Messiah died for our sins in accordance with, along the line of, as
the fulfilment of, the great single narrative of Israel&amp;rsquo;s scriptures.
Only so will we get fresh clarity in our thinking and, equally
importantly, fresh energy for our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, as again I try to explain in the book, we have I believe
committed a triple mistake in our thinking about the cross &amp;ndash; though it
doesn&amp;rsquo;t start with the cross, but, like so many things, with our
eschatology. We have &lt;em&gt;platonized&lt;/em&gt; our eschatology, speaking and praying
about &amp;lsquo;going to heaven when we die&amp;rsquo; without realising that this is the
first-century teaching, not of the New Testament, but of Plutarch and
the other middle Platonists. The New Testament is not about souls going
up to heaven but about the new Jerusalem coming down from heaven to
earth, about the new creation already symbolized in the wilderness
tabernacle and brought into reality by the Royal Priest, Israel&amp;rsquo;s
ultimate representative, the Word made Flesh. And this isn&amp;rsquo;t just a
matter of adjusting some nuts and bolts of what we say and think about
our ultimate future &amp;ndash; about &lt;em&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; ultimate future! What we say about
the future plays back at once into how we conceive the problem to which
the cross and resurrection are the God-given solution. If we are simply
thinking about our souls going to heaven we quickly shrink the human
vocation &amp;ndash; to be the Image-bearers, the Royal Priesthood &amp;ndash; into mere
morality. Morality matters vitally but it matters because it is the
byproduct of being Image-bearers, summing up the praises of creation
rather than worshipping and serving the creature; morality matters
because only through true image-bearers will the rescuing divine justice
flow out into the world. But if we focus on morality &amp;ndash; making the
knowledge of good and evil the fruit around which we construct our
theological menu &amp;ndash; then we turn the whole large drama of creation and
new creation into a self-centred play about me and my sin and what God&amp;rsquo;s
going to do about it. And, with a great deal of western theology, we
then re-read Genesis and all that follows not as the story of the Temple
and the Image but as the story of humans failing an exam, deserving
punishment, and the punishment eventually falling elsewhere. And though
there is indeed truth within that shrunken narrative &amp;ndash; the truth of the
Cross is so vast and deep that it shines out still even from our
distortions &amp;ndash; if we put that little moral equation at the centre we
will never understand what the Bible as a whole, what Jesus as a whole,
was and is all about. We have, then, platonized our eschatology, and to
fit we have &lt;em&gt;moralized&lt;/em&gt; our anthropology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the result is that we have again and again been in danger
of &lt;em&gt;paganizing&lt;/em&gt; our soteriology. It is in the ancient pagan world, not
the ancient Jewish world, that we find stories of an angry God and an
innocent victim and a king or an expedition or a country being rescued
from divine wrath because someone &amp;ndash; preferably an innocent someone &amp;ndash;
get in the way at the last minute. Now I know that few if any preachers,
and few if any theologians, will own up to having preached about Jesus
in that way. They will always insist that they speak of Jesus&#39; death as
the act of divine love. But you know, and I know, that this pagan story
is what generations of people in the churches have &lt;em&gt;heard&lt;/em&gt;. And it&amp;rsquo;s all
too easy for them to hear it because that is often how generations of
Christians have behaved: using would-be redemptive violence whether
domestically or internationally, and always asserting that it is done
out of love, done with the best of intentions. And so people hear what
they think is the gospel, and instead of hearing &amp;lsquo;God so &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; the
world that he &lt;em&gt;gave&lt;/em&gt; his only son&amp;rsquo; they hear &amp;lsquo;God so &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; the world
that he &lt;em&gt;killed&lt;/em&gt; his only son&amp;rsquo;. And because that pagan story is so easy
for people to slip into in their imaginations, generations have done
exactly that; and the biblical truth of penal substitution is thereby
both distorted and shrunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distorted: because there *is *a biblical truth we can call penal
substitution, but it is not well expressed within the platonized
eschatology and the moralized anthropology. It belongs in its clearest
formulaic expression in Romans 8.1-4, where Paul declares that there is
&amp;lsquo;no condemnation for those in the Messiah&amp;rsquo;, because on the cross &amp;lsquo;God
condemned Sin in the flesh&amp;rsquo;. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t say that God punished Jesus; he
says God punished &lt;em&gt;Sin&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; Sin with a capital S, as we might say &amp;ndash; in
the representative &lt;em&gt;flesh&lt;/em&gt; of the Messiah. That is at the heart of a
complicated argument which I have tried to spell out in the book and
won&amp;rsquo;t attempt even to summarize here, except to say that the
clearest *non­-*formulaic expressions are found where most theologians
don&amp;rsquo;t bother looking for them &amp;ndash; in the four gospels themselves. (And,
by the way, this is one reason among many others why there is such a
fad, both in the Dan Brown circles and in western theology, particularly
in America, for the non-canonical gospels like &lt;em&gt;Thomas&lt;/em&gt; and the rest.
This deep and dark narrative has been surgically removed from those
traditions, because the true gospel is far more shocking and radical
than the gnostics ancient and modern have ever understood or wanted to
understand.) The four gospels are all about &lt;em&gt;the Kingdom of God&lt;/em&gt;, a
theme astonishingly muted to this day in much modern western preaching
and teaching, even among would-be Bible Christians, perhaps for the
reason that it generates at once, as John&amp;rsquo;s gospel does in spades, what
we today with our little categories call &amp;lsquo;political theology&amp;rsquo;. How can
the good news that the world&amp;rsquo;s creator has rescued creation from
disaster and established his Son, his true Image, at the centre of his
remade world &amp;ndash; how can this news not at once have implications for
every &lt;em&gt;polis&lt;/em&gt;, every household, every community and country, every
polity and policy? How can we not at once be driven to reflect and act
on the basis that the dark powers have been defeated so that the power
of love may flood the world and bring about the justice and peace which
the secular world knows it wants but can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I mean when I say that the normal theories about the
atonement have not only distorted but also &amp;lsquo;shrunk&amp;rsquo; the meaning of penal
substitution. In the four gospels the story of Jesus is set in
counterpoint with the story of evil: of the snake in the garden, the
tottering tower of Babel, the power of Pharaoh killing the babies (think
of Herod in the gospels), of rebellious Israel, wicked priests and
kings, false prophets, idolatries to left, right and centre. Jesus goes
on his way, announcing that this is how God is becoming king, and
apparently drawing onto himself as though by a magnet all the evil in
the world, from the shrieking demons in the synagogue to the plotting
priests in the Sanhedrin and ultimately to the pathetic representative
of the Ruler of the World. Judas and Pilate merely bring into sharp
focus what is going on all along. And Evil &amp;ndash; Sin with a capital S &amp;ndash; is
gathered together into one place and does its worst, the worst thing
imaginable, killing the one true Man, the one genuine Israelite, the
Word made flesh. And with his death, exactly as Isaiah, Zechariah and
the Psalms had glimpsed through a glass darkly, Pharaoh is overthrown,
Babel tumbles to the ground, the gods of the world had done their worst.
As Paul put it in Colossians, on the cross Jesus disarmed the
principalities and powers and made a public example of them, celebrating
his triumph over them. And the way this happened was by Jesus,
representing Israel, representing thereby the whole human race, and
equally representing and embodying the one God himself &amp;ndash; by Jesus
taking upon himself the weight of evil hanging over all flesh. One
person must die, said unwitting Caiaphas, so that the nation may not
perish; yes, says John, and not just the nation but the whole scattered
children of God. &amp;lsquo;This is your hour,&amp;rsquo; said Jesus as they arrested him,
&amp;lsquo;and the power of darkness&amp;rsquo;; and he went into the heart of that darkness
so that Peter and the others would not suffer it; so that Barabbas and
the brigand on the cross might be freed; so that, like the chickens
protected by the death of the mother hen, all those who came to him for
refuge would find that he had taken their place. The victory is won &amp;ndash;
&amp;lsquo;Christus Victor&amp;rsquo;, if you like, but a much bigger idea than many
theories which have gone by that name &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the representative
substitution of the Servant, the Son, the Image, the Lover, the
footwasher, the one who has saved the world and revealed the glory at
last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, not some cheap and logic-chopped scheme, is why there is
forgiveness of sins; that is why there is now a Gentile mission; that is
why the followers of Jesus do not constitute &amp;lsquo;a religion&amp;rsquo; like other
so-called &amp;lsquo;religions&amp;rsquo;, to be catalogued by secular modernity, pinned to
the wall like so many dead butterflies, but a &lt;em&gt;polis&lt;/em&gt;, a new kind of
city, a new kind of community, a Spirit-driven, suffering-love people
who follow their Master to the places where the world is in sharpest
pain in order that by the Spirit they may embody the love of God and the
pain of God right there, and so bring the healing of God and the hope of
God into the world that so badly needs it. &lt;em&gt;Unless we read the gospels
like this we are falsifying them&lt;/em&gt;, as we do when we chop them into tiny
snippets and turn them into moral lessons, or even, heaven help us, into
abstract theological lessons. They are the living story of how the Lord
of life drew the powers of evil on to himself and, by dying under their
weight, disarmed and disabled them so that from now on they are a
defeated rabble, even though in our dualistic modern spiritualities we
still imagine them to have power over us. They are the
launching-narrative of our own story, the first act in the new divine
drama in which we are called to play our parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is why, as I draw to my close and thank you for your kind
attention through a rather brief and partial treatment, we need not a
refined set of theories but a larger vision of the biblical narrative if
we are to understand, preach and live out the message and meaning of the
cross. The heart of my new book asks a question: by the evening of the
first Good Friday, what had changed in the world? Clearly all the New
Testament writers think that something has changed: what was it and how
do we make that new reality our own? The modern world has displaced the
Christian narrative; it isn&amp;rsquo;t just that most of our contemporaries
profess not to believe in God or Jesus, but that they have in their
heads a world narrative in which world history arrived at its redemptive
moment in the eighteenth century with the rise of science and technology
and the banishing of God to a distant realm, to be visited by the pious
few like a kind family calling on an elderly relative every Sunday. The
western churches have regularly colluded with this absurd diminishment
of the Bible and the gospel. But the cross, told as the climax of all
four gospels and particularly John&amp;rsquo;s on which I have focused this
evening, leaves us no choice. &amp;lsquo;Now is the judgment of this world; now is
the ruler of the world cast out; and if I am lifted up from the earth I
will draw all people to myself.&amp;rsquo; This is what it means that the Messiah
died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures. We have some fresh
thinking to do, to put it mildly. But thinking, the realm of &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt;,
has become flesh, and must once again become flesh, our flesh, our
footwashing flesh, driven by the Spirit to be for the world what Jesus
was for Israel, to be the means by which the Spirit holds the world to
account as Jesus held Pilate to account. Having loved his own, having
revealed the glory, Jesus loved them to the end; and as he resumed his
clothes he told them, &amp;lsquo;This is my command: that you love one another as
I have loved you.&amp;rsquo; That is how the glory will be revealed in tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s
world. That is how the world, saved once for all by his victory on the
cross, will as he promised be flooded with his glory and knowledge as
the waters cover the sea. We are to be, in the power of the Spirit, new
Genesis people; new Exodus people; new Isaiah people; new gospel people;
new Jesus people. That is the meaning of atonement, then and now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sharing in the Divine Nature</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/faith/sharing-in-the-divine-nature/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/faith/sharing-in-the-divine-nature/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;sharing-the-righteousness-of-christ&#34;&gt;Sharing the Righteousness of Christ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heb 1:9 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore
God, your God has set you above your companions by anointing you with
the oil of joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 1:16-17 is how unrighteous man can become righteous. It is by faith
according to the Gospel of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 3:20-22 because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified
in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin. But now
apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being
witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 4:3 Abraham is an example from scripture&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Abraham believed God,
and it was credited to him as righteousness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 4:5 &amp;ndash; the same way for us all. &amp;ldquo;But to the one who does not work,
but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as
righteousness,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 4:9 it is faith in gods promises, not faith in Jesus&#39; sacrifice. But
the Gospel requires that this faith includes faith that Jesus is God
incarnate. Faith that Israel is God&amp;rsquo;s chosen people is not enough (Rom
9:31). Our faith must include not labouring for our own righteousness
and therefore must include faith that God gives us righteousness as a
gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For not knowing about God&amp;rsquo;s righteousness and seeking to establish
their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
4For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who
believes.&amp;rdquo; (Rom 10:3-4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 5:1 &amp;ldquo;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 9:30 What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue
righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is
by faith;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Righteousness by faith&amp;quot; is a transaction, an experience. It is
submitting to &amp;quot;the righteousness of God.&amp;quot; It is a change of standing
before God and His law. It is a regeneration, a new birth. Because of
this it is not simply a cover for unrepentant sin, allowing us to live
as we wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 6, &amp;ldquo;Offer yourself to God&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Yielding to Christ&amp;rsquo;s righteousness is
required for us to be sanctified. It is His work in us which we can give
ourselves to or resist. But we have to do the giving. It is offering,
sacrificing, giving ourselves over to His transformation, rather than a
grudging allowing Him to correct us in small measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are sanctified by the truth. As we meditate on God&amp;rsquo;s purity and
righteousness we are drawn into Him and see righteousness as more and
more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ is both the author and finisher of our faith; He justifies and
sanctifies us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might
become the righteousness of God. &lt;strong&gt;2 Cor 5:21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;others&#34; class=&#34;H2-Numbered&#34;&gt;Others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Cor 1:30, 31 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who
has become for us wisdom from God&amp;mdash;that is, our righteousness, holiness
and redemption. Therefore, as it is written: &amp;ldquo;Let the one who boasts
boast in the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You must be righteous even as your father in heaven is righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-thoughts&#34;&gt;My thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 10:22 let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the
full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse
us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure
water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 9:9 This is an illustration for the present time, indicating
that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the
conscience of the worshiper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will
forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 John 2:28 And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He
appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His
coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 2:16 know that a person is not justified by the works of the
law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in
Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the
works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be
justified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:9 So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham,
the man of faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 3:27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed
yourselves with Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 9:28 so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of
many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring
salvation to those who are waiting for him. - there is nothing more that
needs to be done for our son. Jesus has already done it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel Teflon-coated clean? All-the-time clean? That your sin and
shortcomings do not and cannot make you dirty or give you a guilty
conscience? That you do not need to confess your sins to God in order to
draw near to him with joy and confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 10:14 For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who
are being made holy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 10:17-18 Then he adds: &amp;quot;Their sins and lawless acts I will
remember no more.&amp;quot; And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for
sin is no longer necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just about Jesus obtaining forgiveness for our sins. Wonderful
as that is, it is not all that his death has achieved for us. We can
know we are forgiven, but still be very conscious of our sinfulness. Our
conscience can condemn us even though we know God does not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to know our sins are forgiven as a free gift, with nothing at
all for us to contribute. But in order for us to have a clean conscience
we also need to know that Christ is our righteousness. Our identity is
Christ, not mucky me. My conscience is his conscience, my confidence is
his confidence, my righteousness is his righteousness. And this not as a
doctrinal truth but as a felt reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our conscience condemns us when we have learnt to live in Christ,
then we know something is seriously wrong! We must not suppress that
warning, but pay attention to the discipline of the Lord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;if our conscience does not condemn us...&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this treasure is hidden in jars of clay. That is how God wants it to
be.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Corinthians 4:7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that
this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to feel that my every action and thought was scrutinised by God
and found wanting. Although I knew I was forgiven and accepted in
Christ, it still left me feeling I was basically displeasing to God,
always falling short. This made fellowship with him a bit like a visit
to the dentist, necessary but not a pleasant prospect. Instead my basic
inclination was to avoid him except for allotted quiet times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;sharing-in-intercession&#34;&gt;Sharing in Intercession&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mystery of prayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scriptures never really explain prayer. Why do we need to pray to a
loving God who knows the thoughts of our hearts, knows our needs better
than we do, who clothes the lilies and feeds the sparrows without them
asking? Jesus told us to pray but never explained why it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the scriptures tell us some intriguing truths about prayer. We
are given some familiar examples of intercessory prayer in characters
such as Abraham, Moses, Samuel and Elijah. Isaiah tells us that God was
searching through the land looking for someone to intercede for Israel,
but found no one. Jesus interceded for Peter (Lk 22:31), and for all of
us (Jn 17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See zech 12:10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these cases it is clear that God himself was provoking and
motivating the intercession. This tells us something very important
about intercession. It is not men trying to move the hand of God, but
God trying to engage men in His mission. However strange this may seem
to us, it is essential to understand that all effective prayer
originates in God&#39;s heart, not ours. That is why John says, if we know
we pray according to his will we know we have received whatever we ask
(1Jn 5:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new testament tells us two extraordinary facts in relation to
prayer, the significance of which I think has largely gone unnoticed.
The first is that the Holy Spirit intercedes for us (Rom 8:26), the
second is that Jesus intercedes for it us (Heb 7:25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 8:26 In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do
not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes
for us through wordless groans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 8:27 Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the
Spirit [is,] because He makes intercession for the saints according to
[the will of] God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 7:25 Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to
God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans8:34 Who [is] he who condemns? [It is] Christ who died, and
furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who
also makes intercession for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that both the Holy Spirit and Jesus are engaged in intercession
tells us that intercession has nothing to do with moving God on behalf
of men, but rather it is to share in a divine mystery. As Paul says in
Rome 8:27 the Spirit intercedes according to the will of God. It is
God&#39;s will that we intercede before Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus and the Holy Spirit make intercession and the Father receives it.
Virtually all biblical prayers are addressed to the Father. Although
Jesus does give us authority to pray to him promising that he will
answer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John14:13-14 And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the
Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I
will do [it.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the Holy Spirit working and living within us, we are &amp;lsquo;caught up&amp;rsquo; into
what we might call the divine dialogue of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercession is part of the inner working of God Himself. Why this
should be and how it works we will perhaps never know, but to know this
fact transforms our understanding of prayer and intercession.
Intercession is no longer seen as man pleading with God, but rather men
sharing in God&#39;s very nature. Seen like this prayer becomes full of
faith and joy. It becomes an adventure exploring the very heart of God
and sharing in His passions and purposes for the world. To truly pray is
to be caught up with the Holy Spirit into God&#39;s throne room; not to
plead with God but to rule with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All we have to do is to choose to take time to pray and to put
ourselves, as it were, &amp;lsquo;at God&amp;rsquo;s disposal&amp;rsquo;, allowing the Spirit to do
the work within us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer and especially intercession is sharing in the divine nature and
as such is an expression and experience of deep intimacy with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen like this, prayer starts with us coming to God and saying, &amp;quot;I know
you are interceding for XYZ, can I join in too?&amp;quot; Wow! That sounds like
a recipe for answered prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approached like this we are far less likely to start telling God what to
do and more inclined to start with, &amp;quot;Lord, please show me what is on
your heart for this situation.&amp;quot; This means we need to take time to
listen to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A part of the mystery of prayer is that intercession takes time. God
does not tell us why, He just tells us that it does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 18:7-8 And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones,
who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell
you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the
Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God promises to answer quickly the prayers of those who cry out day and
night. The intercession of Jesus and the Holy Spirit are ongoing and
persistent. As we share in that intercession we also need to share in
persistence until we know we have our answer or we actually see the
answer. This also is a matter hearing God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another part of the mystery of intercession is that God looks for human
partners to join Jesus and the Holy Spirit in intercession. What a
privilege to be able to partner with God in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Romans 8:27) It is about the transforming and healing nature of love,
for intercession is about the expression of our love and our willingness
to share in the transformation and healing of the world that is the will
of God. And it is about patience and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 8 assumes that generally we do know what to pray. God puts on our
hearts those things he wants us to join with him in intercession for.
His sheep hear his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solitary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lengthy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily with understanding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sophisticated. Elijah, Moses&lt;/p&gt;

God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-38-commands-of-jesus&#34;&gt;The 38 Commands of Jesus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;relationship-with-god&#34;&gt;Relationship with God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-must-be-born-again&#34;&gt;You must be born again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You must be born again.&amp;quot; (John 3:7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;remain-in-me-and-i-will-remain-in-you&#34;&gt;Remain in Me and I will remain in you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by
itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless
you remain in me.&amp;quot; (John 15:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-then-is-how-you-should-pray&#34;&gt;This, then, is how you should pray&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, then, is how you should pray: &#39;Our Father in heaven, hallowed be
your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in
heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also
have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver
us from the evil one.&#39; (Matt 6:9-15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-this-in-remembrance-of-me&#34;&gt;Do this in Remembrance of Me&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them,
saying, &#39;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.&#39;
In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, &#39;This cup is
the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.&#39;&amp;quot; (Luke
22:19-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;love-one-another&#34;&gt;Love One Another&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-one-another-1&#34;&gt;Love One Another&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.&amp;quot; (John
15:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wash-one-anothers-feet&#34;&gt;Wash One Another&#39;s Feet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also
should wash one another&#39;s feet.&amp;quot; (John 13:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-not-despise-childlike-believers&#34;&gt;Do not Despise Childlike Believers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell
you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in
heaven.&amp;quot; (Matt 18:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-not-oppose-other-believers&#34;&gt;Do not Oppose Other Believers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Teacher,&amp;quot; said John, &amp;quot;we saw a man driving out demons in your name
and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.&amp;quot; &amp;ldquo;Do not stop
him,&amp;quot; Jesus said. &amp;quot;No one who does a miracle in my name can in the
next moment say anything bad about me, for whoever is not against us is
for us.&amp;quot; (Mark 9:38-40)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-merciful&#34;&gt;Be Merciful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.&amp;quot; (Luke 6:36)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-not-judge&#34;&gt;Do not Judge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge
others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be
measured to you.&amp;quot; (Matt 7:1-2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;forgive----as-you-are-forgiven&#34;&gt;Forgive &amp;ndash; as you are forgiven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone,
forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.&amp;quot;
But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven
forgive your sins.&amp;quot; (Mark 11:25-26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;care-for-those-in-distress&#34;&gt;Care for Those in Distress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then the King will say to those on his right, &#39;Come, you who are
blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for
you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me
something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I
was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed
me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to
visit me.&amp;quot; (Matt 25:34-36)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-a-good-samaritan&#34;&gt;Be a Good Samaritan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The expert in the law replied, &#39;The one who had mercy on him.&#39; Jesus
told him, &amp;quot;Go and do likewise.&amp;quot; (Luke 10:30-37) (In reference to the
&amp;quot;Good Samaritan&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-your-enemies&#34;&gt;Love Your Enemies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have heard that it was said, &#39;Love your neighbour and hate your
enemy.&#39; But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who
persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes
his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the
righteous and the unrighteous.&amp;quot; (Matt 5:43-45)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;turn-the-other-cheek&#34;&gt;Turn the other Cheek&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have heard that it was said, &#39;Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.&#39;
But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on
the right cheek, turn to him the other also.&amp;quot; (Matt 5:38-39)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;go-the-extra-mile&#34;&gt;Go the extra mile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your
cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two
miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one
who wants to borrow from you.&amp;quot; (Matt 5:40-42)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;settle-disputes-between-believers-in-this-manner&#34;&gt;Settle Disputes Between Believers in this Manner...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just
between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother
over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that
&#39;every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three
witnesses.&#39; If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and
if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a
pagan or a tax collector.&amp;quot;(Matt 18:15-17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;settle-matters-quickly-with-your-adversary&#34;&gt;Settle matters quickly with your adversary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court.
Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over
to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you
may be thrown into prison.&amp;quot; (Matt 5:25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;trust-god&#34;&gt;Trust God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;put-god-first&#34;&gt;Put God First&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all
these things shall be added to you.&amp;quot; (Matt 6:33)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-not-store-up-treasures-on-earth&#34;&gt;Do not Store up Treasures on Earth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust
destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for
yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and
where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is,
there your heart will be also.&amp;quot; (Matt 6:19-21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-not-worry-about-your-needs&#34;&gt;Do not Worry about Your Needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat
or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more
important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at
the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns,
and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable
than they?&amp;quot; (Matt 6:25-26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-not-worry-about-tomorrow&#34;&gt;Do not Worry about Tomorrow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about
itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.&amp;quot; (Matt 6:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ask-seek-and-knock&#34;&gt;Ask, Seek, and Knock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the
door will be opened to you.&amp;quot; (Matt 7:7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-complete-faith-in-god&#34;&gt;Have Complete Faith in God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Have faith in God,&amp;quot; Jesus answered. &amp;quot;I tell you the truth, if anyone
says to this mountain, &#39;Go, throw yourself into the sea,&#39; and does not
doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will
be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer,
believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.&amp;quot; (Mark
11:22-24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;holiness&#34;&gt;Holiness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;get-rid-of-whatever-causes-you-to-sin&#34;&gt;Get rid of whatever causes you to sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away.
It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole
body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin,
cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of
your body than for your whole body to go into hell.&amp;quot;(Matt 5:29-30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-not-swear-at-all&#34;&gt;Do Not Swear at All&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is
God&#39;s throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by
Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. And do not swear by
your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. Simply let
your &#39;Yes&#39; be &#39;Yes,&#39; and your &#39;No,&#39; &#39;No&#39;; anything beyond this
comes from the evil one.&amp;quot; (Matt 5:34-37)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enter-through-the-narrow-gate&#34;&gt;Enter Through the Narrow Gate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the
road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is
the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find
it.&amp;quot; (Matt 7:13-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-must-be-ready&#34;&gt;You Must be Ready&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour
when you do not expect him.&amp;quot; (Luke 12:40)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;watch-out-for-false-prophets&#34;&gt;Watch out for false prophets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep&#39;s clothing,
but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.&amp;quot; (Matt 7:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;guard-what-is-sacred&#34;&gt;Guard what is Sacred&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If
you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear
you to pieces.&amp;quot; (Matt 7:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;witness&#34;&gt;Witness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;let-your-light-shine-before-men&#34;&gt;Let your light shine before men&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. &amp;quot;
In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your
good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.&amp;quot; (Matt 5:14;16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heal-the-sick&#34;&gt;Heal the Sick&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive
out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.&amp;quot; (Matt 10:1)
&amp;quot;Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive
out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.&amp;quot; (Matt 10:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;go-and-make-disciples&#34;&gt;Go and Make Disciples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching
them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you
always, to the very end of the age.&amp;quot; (Matt 28:19-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obey-god-without-fanfare&#34;&gt;Obey God without fanfare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;obey-what-i-command&#34;&gt;Obey What I Command&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you love me, you will obey what I command.&amp;quot; (John 14:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;give-to-please-god-not-to-be-seen&#34;&gt;Give to Please God, Not to be Seen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Be careful not to do your &#39;acts of righteousness&#39; before men, to be
seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in
heaven.&amp;quot; (Matt 6:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pray-privately-not-to-be-seen-of-men&#34;&gt;Pray Privately, Not to be Seen of Men&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to
pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by
men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But
when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your
Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in
secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like
pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.&amp;quot;
(Matt 6:5-7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fast-without-fanfare&#34;&gt;Fast Without Fanfare&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When you fast, do not look sombre as the hypocrites do, for they
disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the
truth, they have received their reward in full.&amp;quot; (Matt 6:16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-not-exalt-yourself&#34;&gt;Do not Exalt Yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But you are not to be called &#39;Rabbi,&#39; for you have only one Master
and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth &#39;father,&#39;
for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called
&#39;teacher,&#39; for you have one Teacher, the Christ. The greatest among
you will be your servant. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled,
and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.&amp;quot; (Matt 23:8-12)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-american-awakening-script&#34;&gt;The American Awakening Script&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is &amp;hellip;. What&amp;rsquo;s your name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Name] I&amp;rsquo;ve just got to tell you two things real quick; that God loves
you and He has an awesome plan for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Befire I go, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to ask you a real quick question. If you were to
die today, do you know for sure, without a shadow of a doubt, that you
would go straight to heaven?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[if &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; say] Great! Why would you say yes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[If they don&amp;rsquo;t say they are born again, carry on&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! Let me tell you three things the bible says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The wages of sin is death, but the FREE gift of God is eternal life
through Jesus Christ&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;ldquo;whosoever&amp;rdquo; right? Of course you are, we all are. So before I
go, I&amp;rsquo;m going to say a quick prayer for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lord, I pray that you bless [name] and his / her family with long and
healthy lives. Make yourself so real to him / her and if [name] has
never received Jesus Christ as his / her Lord and Saviour, I pray that
he/she would do so right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[name] If you would like to receive this free gift; Jesus Christ as
your Lord and Saviour, just say this with me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus come into my heart. // Forgive me of my sins // Wash me // change
me // and set me free. // Let me never be the same again. // Jesus, I
believe you died for me. // Help me to live for you. // And fulfil
everything You have called me to do. // I thank you that I&amp;rsquo;m now
forgiven // and on my way to heaven. // In Jesus name, Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Name] I have the best news anyone will ever tell you. As a minister
of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I tell you that all your sins are
forgiven right now! And you can know for sure that you&amp;rsquo;re on your way to
heaven. Remember, when you make a mistake, don&amp;rsquo;t run from God, run to
Him, because He loves you and He does have an awesome plan for your
life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Gospel in 1 Corinthians</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/the-gospel-in-1-corinthians/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/the-gospel-in-1-corinthians/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-gospel-in-1-corinthians&#34;&gt;The Gospel in 1 Corinthians&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapters 1-3 Paul uses the cross as an illustration of the
&amp;quot;foolishness&amp;quot; of the Gospel in order to challenge the behaviour of the
Corinthians who are arguing with on another. His answer is that the
Gospel is a Gospel of power, not of [human] words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul&#39;s occasional references to Christ&#39;s death in  the letter are
actually to His resurrection rather than to the cross, for instance 1
Cor 6:14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ch 10 and 11 Paul uses the last-supper as an appeal to unity, but
without any reference to the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not until Ch 15 that Paul offers any glimpse of his Gospel, and
here His focus is on the Resurrection. Even when he describes our death,
he relates it to Adam rather than the cross (v22). Paul seems to be
entirely focused on our Life in Christ; His resurrection and ours with
Him.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Gospel in Acts</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/the-gospel-in-acts/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-in-acts&#34;&gt;The Gospel in Acts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proclamation&#34;&gt;Proclamation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 2:10 &amp;quot;we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own
tongues!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 2:17, 21, 23, 36, 38 &amp;lsquo;In the last days, God says, I will pour out
my Spirit on all people.&amp;hellip; And everyone who calls on the name of the
Lord will be saved. ... You put him to death by nailing him to the
cross. But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of
death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on
him.&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made
this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah. ... &amp;ldquo;So repent
and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the
forgiveness of your sins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 5:41 Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house,
they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus
is the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 7 &amp;ndash; Stephens Sermon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 10:36-38, 42-43 You know the message God sent to the people of
Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is
Lord of all. You know what has happened throughout the province of
Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached&amp;mdash;
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and
how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power
of the devil, because God was with him.&amp;hellip; He commanded us to preach
to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as
judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him
that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through
his name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 13:32, 38-39 &amp;ldquo;We tell you the good news: What God promised our
ancestors he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus
... I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is
proclaimed to you. Through him everyone who believes is set free from
every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law
of Moses.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 14:15, 22 We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from
these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the
earth and the sea and everything in them&amp;quot; ... They strengthened the
disciples encouraging them to remain true to the faith. &amp;ldquo;We must go
through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,&amp;rdquo; they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 16:30-31 &amp;ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&amp;rdquo; They replied,
&amp;ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved&amp;mdash;you and your
household.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 17:7, 16, 18, 30-31 &amp;quot;They are all defying Caesar&amp;rsquo;s decrees,
saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.&amp;quot;... While Paul
was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that
the city was full of idols.&amp;hellip; Paul was preaching the good news about
Jesus and the resurrection. ... &amp;quot;He commands all people everywhere
to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with
justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to
everyone by raising him from the dead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 18:5 Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to
the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 19:8 Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three
months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 20:21 I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn
to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 26:17-18 &amp;quot;I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn
them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so
that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who
are sanctified by faith in me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 28:23, 31 He witnessed to them from morning till evening,
explaining about the kingdom of God, and from the Law of Moses and
from the Prophets he tried to persuade them about Jesus. ... He
proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demonstration&#34;&gt;Demonstration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 4:29-31 Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your
servants to speak your word with great boldness. Stretch out your hand
to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy
servant Jesus.&amp;quot; After they prayed, the place where they were meeting
was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke
the word of God boldly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 8:5-7, 12 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed
the Messiah there. When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he
performed, they all paid close attention to what he said. For with
shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed
or lame were healed.&amp;hellip; when they believed Philip as he proclaimed
the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they
were baptized, both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 14:3 &amp;quot;the Lord confirmed the message of his grace by enabling
them to perform signs and wonders ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 28:8-9 The chief official&#39;s father was sick in bed, suffering
from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer,
placed his hands on him and healed him. When this had happened, the
rest of the sick on the island came and were cured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disciples-who-did-not-heal&#34;&gt;Disciples who did not heal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 9:32-43 In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha ... who became
sick and died, ... so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda,
they ... urged him, &amp;ldquo;Please come at once!&amp;rdquo; ... Turning toward the dead
woman, Peter said, &amp;ldquo;Tabitha, get up.&amp;rdquo; She opened her eyes, and sat up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Gospel Jesus Preached</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/the-gospel-jesus-preached/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/the-gospel-jesus-preached/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-gospel-jesus-preached&#34;&gt;The Gospel Jesus Preached&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-before-the-cross&#34;&gt;The Gospel before the cross&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought about the fact that the Gospel Jesus proclaimed
and acted out all took place before Jesus went to the cross? We may not
be able to imagine preaching the Gospel without reference to the cross,
yet the Gospel Jesus proclaimed did not include, as far as we can tell,
references to Him paying the penalty for our sins on the cross!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might think that Jesus could not speak of the His atoning death
because it had not yet happened, yet we find that Jesus made numerous
references to His coming death and resurrection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem! O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I
have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her
chicks under her wings, but you were not willing! Look, your house is
left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you
say, &amp;lsquo;Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&#39;&amp;rdquo; (Lk 13:33-35)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, &amp;lsquo;We are going up to
Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the
Son of Man will be fulfilled. He will be handed over to the Gentiles.
They will mock him, insult him and spit on him; they will flog him and
kill him. On the third day he will rise again.&amp;rsquo; (Lk 18:31-33)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge
fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the
heart of the earth.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 12:40)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t
tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised
from the dead ... But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they
did not recognise him, but have done to him everything they wished. In
the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.&amp;rdquo; (Matt
17:9-12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Gospel record, the only time Jesus explained His coming
death as an atonement was during the Last Supper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for
the forgiveness of sins.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 26:28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one occurrence proves that Jesus understood His coming death as
atonement, yet before the Last Supper He chose not to explain this when
He spoke of His death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Jesus referred to His death in various ways He never took the
opportunity to explain its role in paying for our sin. He either simply
spoke about the event or used it to teach that suffering and persecution
was to be expected as the cost of following Him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders,
chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on
the third day be raised to life. If anyone would come after me, he
must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. (Lk
9:22-23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then the owner of the vineyard said, &amp;lsquo;What shall I do? I will send my
son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.&amp;rsquo; But when the tenants
saw him, they talked the matter over. &amp;lsquo;This is the heir,&amp;rsquo; they said.
&amp;lsquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.&#39;... He will come
and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 20:13-16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are so used to explaining the Gospel in terms of the cross as an
atonement that we may fail to stop and consider the Gospel that Jesus
Himself preached. The purpose of this study is to explore Jesus&amp;rsquo; Gospel
and consider how His example might influence the way we share the
Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-gospel&#34;&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; Gospel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel is announced by Jesus very simply, as recorded in Mark 1:15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The time has come,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The kingdom of God is near. Repent and
believe the good news!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the Gospels and the person and mission of Jesus we need to
understand what this simple statement meant to Jesus and his hearers.
There are three parts we need to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time has come&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of God is near&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repent and believe the good news&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-time-has-come&#34;&gt;The time has come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s preaching made people expectant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their
hearts if John might possibly be the Christ. (Lk 3:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&#39; announcement &amp;ldquo;The time has come&amp;rdquo; builds on this expectation which
was based on many prophecies, spanning the entire period of the Old
Testament, concerning a coming new Kingdom of God. Here is a small
selection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among
your own brothers. You must listen to him.&amp;rdquo; (De 18:15 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last days the mountain of the LORD&amp;rsquo;s temple will be established
as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and
all nations will stream to it. Many peoples will come and say, &amp;ldquo;Come,
let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of
Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.&amp;rdquo;
(Isa 2:2-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government
will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counsellor,
Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of
his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on
David&amp;rsquo;s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it
with justice and righteousness from that time on and for ever. (Isa
9:6-7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem!
See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle
and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will take
away the chariots from Ephraim and the war-horses from Jerusalem, and
the battle-bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations.
His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of
the earth. (Zech 9:9-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophecies like these gave the Israelites an unquenchable expectation
that one day God would visit His chosen people and restore their
fortunes under a Godly king in David&amp;rsquo;s line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-kingdom-of-god-is-near&#34;&gt;The kingdom of God is near&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophecies did not just point to a new king, but to a whole new
covenant with God in a new Kingdom under God&amp;rsquo;s rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The time is coming,&amp;rdquo; declares the LORD, &amp;ldquo;when I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. It will
not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took
them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my
covenant, though I was a husband to them,&amp;rdquo; declares the LORD. This is
the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after that
time,&amp;rdquo; declares the LORD. &amp;ldquo;I will put my law in their minds and write
it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
No longer will a man teach his neighbour, or a man his brother,
saying, &amp;lsquo;Know the LORD,&amp;rsquo; because they will all know me, from the least
of them to the greatest,&amp;rdquo; declares the LORD. &amp;ldquo;For I will forgive their
wickedness and will remember their sins no more.&amp;rdquo; (Jer 31:31-34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one
shepherd. They will follow my laws and be careful to keep my decrees.
They and their children and their children&amp;rsquo;s children will live in the
Promised Land for ever, and David my servant will be their prince for
ever. I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an
everlasting covenant. ... My dwelling-place will be with them; I will
be their God, and they will be my people. Then the nations will know
that I the LORD make Israel holy&amp;rdquo; (Ezek 37:24-28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is on me, because the LORD has
anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up
the broken-hearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release
from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the LORD&amp;rsquo;s
favour and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,
and provide for those who grieve in Zion&amp;mdash;to bestow on them a crown
of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be
called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the display
of his splendour ... You will feed on the wealth of nations, and in
their riches you will boast. (Isa 61:1-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;repent-and-believe-the-good-news&#34;&gt;Repent and believe the good news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these prophecies were given to a disobedient people of God who
needed to repent of their waywardness and respond in obedience to the
prophet&amp;rsquo;s message. The expectation produced by the wealth of prophecies
was that God would send a Messiah who would turn the hearts of the
people back to God in heartfelt repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and
pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I
hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.&amp;rdquo;
(2Ch 7:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the LORD their
God, and David their king, and they shall come in fear to the LORD and
to his goodness in the latter days. (Hosea 3:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astonishing thing was that not only did Jesus call for repentance he
also announced forgiveness -something only a priest could do, and that
only in the temple in God&amp;rsquo;s presence.  Jesus made Himself that presence
by declaring forgiveness. It is important for us to note that although
Jesus did not explain the atonement, He did announce forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anticipating-the-kingdom&#34;&gt;Anticipating the Kingdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&#39; announcement of the Kingdom had been anticipated by numerous
notable events recorded by Matthew and Luke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The angelic visit to Zachariah:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the
name John ... Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the
Lord their God. And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and
power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children
and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous&amp;mdash;to make ready a
people prepared for the Lord.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 1:16-17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The angelic visit to Mary:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give
him the name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the
Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; his kingdom will
never end.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 1:31-32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zechariah&amp;rsquo;s prophecy at Johns birth:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come and has
redeemed his people. He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in
the house of his servant David (as he said through his holy prophets
of long ago), salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who
hate us&amp;mdash; to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy
covenant, the oath he swore to our father Abraham: to rescue us from
the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear in
holiness and righteousness before him all our days.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 1:67-75 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The angelic visit to the shepherds:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for
all the people. Today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to
you; he is Christ the Lord.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 2:10-11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simeon&amp;rsquo;s prophecy about Jesus:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in
peace. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared
in the sight of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and
for glory to your people Israel.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 2:29-32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The testimony of the Magi:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star
in the east and have come to worship him.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 2:2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John the Baptist&amp;rsquo;s preaching:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Desert of Judea
and saying, &amp;ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 3:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;John said to the crowds coming out to be baptised by him, &amp;ldquo;You brood
of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit
in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, &amp;lsquo;We
have Abraham as our father.&amp;rsquo; For I tell you that out of these stones
God can raise up children for Abraham. The axe is already at the root
of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be
cut down and thrown into the fire.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What should we do then?&amp;rdquo; the
crowd asked. (Lk 3:7-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their
hearts if John might possibly be the Christ. (Lk 3:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 1:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;announcing-the-good-news&#34;&gt;Announcing the Good News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus started his ministry by preaching in the synagogues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about
him spread through the whole countryside. He taught in their
synagogues, and everyone praised him. (Lk 4:14-15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke provides us with an example of this early ministry, where Jesus
reads a prophecy of the coming Kingdom and announces that this prophecy
is now fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom, and
he stood up to read. The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to
him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: &amp;ldquo;The Spirit
of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news
to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and
recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim
the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favour.&amp;rdquo; Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it
back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the
synagogue were fastened on him, and he began by saying to them, &amp;ldquo;Today
this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 4:16-21 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new age Jesus preached consisted of victory over Satan as
demonstrated by healing and deliverance, and a new relationship with God
as demonstrated through the pronouncement of forgiveness and Jesus&#39;
teaching on prayer. Everywhere Jesus preached He also &lt;em&gt;demonstrated&lt;/em&gt; the
presence of the New Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact Jesus summarised His mission very simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and
tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 13:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we pray the Lord&amp;rsquo;s prayer, saying &amp;ldquo;Your Kingdom come and your will
be done on earth as it is in heaven&amp;rdquo; this is what we are praying for;
the present reality of the Kingdom that Jesus preached and demonstrated
in healing and deliverance. Without that we can hardly claim to have the
Gospel, and without demonstrating it we can hardly claim to be
proclaiming the Gospel. Jesus&#39; Gospel was not primarily about going to
heaven when we die, but about bringing Heaven&amp;rsquo;s rule here and now on
earth. The miracles were not to prove who Jesus was but the simple
outworking of His Gospel announcement, &amp;ldquo;The Kingdom of God has come&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of
God has come upon you.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 11:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&#39; ascension was the climax for the disciples seeing the kingdom
coming; Jesus&#39; enthronement to rule the Kingdom He had begun to
demonstrate; Jesus now in the heavenly realm from where He would
continue to rule on earth, both directly and also through all those who
believed in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel that Jesus preached was the Kingdom of God here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-himself-is-the-good-news&#34;&gt;Jesus Himself is the Good News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus very clearly presented Himself as the Good News:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;he-is-the-prophet-like-moses&#34;&gt;He is the &amp;ldquo;prophet like Moses&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among
your own brothers. You must listen to him. (De 18:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.&amp;rdquo; (Isa 2:
3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the ancient prophecy Jesus placed Himself above Moses
in authority. Six times in Matt 5:21-48 Jesus quoted from Moses and
replaced the Law with His own instruction. &amp;ldquo;Moses said ... but I say
...&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus made claims to knowing the Father beyond anything Moses could
claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Moses said, &amp;ldquo;Now show me your glory.&amp;rdquo; And the LORD said, &amp;ldquo;I will
cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my
name, the LORD, in your presence... But you cannot see my face, for
no-one may see me and live.&amp;rdquo; (Ex 33:18-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD
knew face to face. (De 34:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is this prophet who has known the Lord face to face; able to speak
from having seen God&amp;rsquo;s face, not just His back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself
God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him
known.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 1:18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;the Father knows me and I know the Father&amp;rdquo; (Jn 10:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I and the Father are one.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 10:30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the
world and going back to the Father.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 16:28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No-one knows the Son except the Father, and no-one knows the Father
except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.&amp;rdquo; (Matt
11:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;he-is-the-anointed-one&#34;&gt;He is the anointed one&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have come from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him
who sent me.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 6:38)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he
sent me.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 8:42)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No-one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I
will raise him up at the last day.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 6:44)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in
me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the
Father, living in me, who is doing his work.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 10:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;he-is-the-prince-of-peace&#34;&gt;He is the Prince of Peace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from
your suffering.&amp;rdquo; (Mk 5:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as
the world gives.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 14:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you
rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and
humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is
easy and my burden is light.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 11:28-30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;he-is-the-eternal-king&#34;&gt;He is the Eternal King&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All things have been committed to me by my Father.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 11:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.&amp;rdquo; (Jn
3:35)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Father judges no-one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son&amp;rdquo;
(Jn 5:22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was
born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.
Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 18:37)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him,
he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be
gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another
as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 25:31-32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jesus-is-how-we-know-god&#34;&gt;Jesus is how we know God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No longer will they teach their neighbour, or say to one another,
&amp;lsquo;Know the LORD,&amp;rsquo; because they will all know me, from the least of them
to the greatest,&amp;rdquo; declares the LORD. &amp;ldquo;For I will forgive their
wickedness and will remember their sins no more.&amp;rdquo; (Jer 31:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus presented Himself as the way we can know God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am the way and the truth and the life. No-one comes to the Father
except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as
well.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 14:6-7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 14:9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit
will take from what is mine and make it known to you.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 16:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jesus-is-the-victor-over-our-enemy&#34;&gt;Jesus is the victor over our enemy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first act of Jesus&#39; mission was to confront Satan in the
wilderness. All the synoptic gospels record the Holy Spirit leading
Jesus to face the temptations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led
by the Spirit in the desert, where for forty days he was tempted by
the devil. (Lk 4:1-2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mission was to invaded Satan&amp;rsquo;s territory and set people free. First
He needed to overcome Satan and bind him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of
God has come upon you. How can anyone enter a strong man&amp;rsquo;s house and
carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then
he can rob his house.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 12:28-29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did this by His obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Away from me, Satan! For it is written: &amp;lsquo;Worship
the Lord your God, and serve him only.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Then the devil left him, and
angels came and attended him. (Matt 4:10-11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&amp;rsquo; obedience to His Father gave Him full authority and power over
Satan and his demons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you
authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the
power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 10:18-19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept
bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from
what bound her?&amp;rdquo; (Lk 13:16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this
world will be driven out.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 12:31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jesus-can-forgive-us-our-sins&#34;&gt;Jesus can forgive us our sins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to
forgive sins&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; He said to the paralysed man, &amp;ldquo;I tell you, get up,
take your mat and go home.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 5:24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so
the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 5:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-summary-of-the-gospel&#34;&gt;A Summary of the Gospel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brief exploration of the Gospel Jesus preached has taken us five
pages! If we are to be able to share the gospel Jesus preached without
referring to a book we need to summarise it in a few words. When we look
for such a summary in the Gospels we find that Jesus provided many
different summaries, each tailored for a different need (look for
example at Matthew 13). We need to learn from Jesus and offer short
relevant summaries according to the need of the person we are talking
to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament nearly always describes the Gospel as the &amp;ldquo;Gospel of
the Kingdom&amp;rdquo;. Any Gospel summary we present should also be about the
Kingdom of God, and not just about individual forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least 17 descriptions of the Gospel in the Acts. Here is
the complete list with the sermons in bold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 2:10; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 2:17, 21, 23, 36, 38;&lt;/strong&gt; Acts 4:29-31; Acts 5:41;
&lt;strong&gt;Acts 7;&lt;/strong&gt; Acts 8:5-7, 12; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 10:36-38, 42-43;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 13:32,
38-39;&lt;/strong&gt; Acts 14:3; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 14:15&lt;/strong&gt;, 22; Acts 16:30-31; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 17:7, 16,
18, 30-31;&lt;/strong&gt; Acts 18:5; Acts 19:8; Acts 20:21; Acts 26:17-18; Acts
28:8-9; Acts 28:23, 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, at least 11 emphasise Jesus as Messiah or King. Only three
descriptions of the Gospel include forgiveness of sins! The others
emphasise turning to God in faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the most illuminating examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that &lt;strong&gt;he is the
one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead&lt;/strong&gt;. (Acts
10:42-43)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They are all defying Caesar&amp;rsquo;s decrees, saying that &lt;strong&gt;there is
another king, one called Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;... Paul was &lt;strong&gt;preaching the good
news about Jesus and the resurrection&lt;/strong&gt;. ... &amp;quot;He commands all people
everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when &lt;strong&gt;he will judge the
world with justice&lt;/strong&gt; by the man he has appointed. He has given proof
of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.&amp;quot; (Acts 17:7, 16, 18,
30-31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 13:32, 38-39 &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;We tell you the good news:&lt;/strong&gt; What God promised
our ancestors he has fulfilled for us, their children, &lt;strong&gt;by raising up
Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; ... I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of
sins is proclaimed to you. &lt;strong&gt;Through him everyone who believes is set
free from every sin&lt;/strong&gt;, a justification you were not able to obtain
under the law of Moses.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 14:15 &lt;strong&gt;We are bringing you good news&lt;/strong&gt;, telling you to &lt;strong&gt;turn from
these worthless things to the living God&lt;/strong&gt;, who made the heavens and the
earth and the sea and everything in them&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 26:17-18 &amp;quot;I am sending you to them to open their eyes and &lt;strong&gt;turn
them from darkness to light&lt;/strong&gt;, and from the power of Satan to God, so
that they may &lt;strong&gt;receive forgiveness of sins&lt;/strong&gt; and a place among those
who are sanctified by faith in me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 10:42-43 and Acts 26:17-18 are especially illuminating as they both
tell us directly what Jesus told the disciples to preach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the six occasions where we get more detail the gospel is presented as
a story of God acting in His world to reveal Himself to mankind. In each
case Jesus&#39; resurrection is the climax of the story. Jesus is the King
of God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom and the rightful judge of all mankind. His desire and
invitation is for us to believe and come into His Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our gospel preaching to be authentic, it must focus on the Kingdom
of God and not on personal sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;presenting-the-gospel-as-jesus-did&#34;&gt;Presenting The Gospel as Jesus did&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-is-good-news&#34;&gt;The Gospel is Good News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point we must remember is that the Gospel is, by definition, Good
News! (At least it is to those who respond in trusting obedience to
Jesus.) Good news, again by definition, is something that makes people
cheerful and gives them hope. That in turn means it must connect with a
need or concern that makes sense to the person. That is why Jesus
tailored His message to the needs and concerns of the person he was
addressing. We should do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; four-part gospel message goes something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created you for relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are alienated from God because of your sin and destined for
eternal hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus died to pay the penalty for your sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only by faith and obedience to Jesus can we be restored to
friendship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this be described as the Gospel of the Kingdom? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. It
is focused on an individual&amp;rsquo;s sinful acts rather than dealing with the
Kingdom of which they are part. The Kingdom and Jesus&#39; resurrection are
not key features and may not be mentioned at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with this way of presenting the Gospel is that most
people don&amp;rsquo;t readily relate to it as good news; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t scratch where
they itch. You therefore have to first work hard at getting a person to
&amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; that they have a problem in their relationship with God that
really matters. Only then does this gospel sound like good news. You
might be able to get them to pray a prayer asking for forgiveness but
probably by the next day they will have forgotten all about it. The
simple fact is that more than 90% of people who &amp;ldquo;respond&amp;rdquo; to this
version of the gospel do not go on to become disciples of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet in three short years, without first explaining the atonement,
Jesus raised up more than 500 disciples to whom he appeared after His
resurrection (1Cor 15:6). It seems likely that on the road to Emmaus
after the resurrection Jesus gave a full explanation of His death as
atonement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his
glory?&amp;quot;^ ^And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained
to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. (Lk
24:26-27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I think we have a significant point. An explanation of the Gospel
in terms of our sin separating us from God is probably not generally the
best approach. That can come later when a person has already met Jesus
and they are curious to understand the scriptures. Let us learn from
Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not have any difficulty drawing a crowd because He spoke about
things that mattered to His hearers. But more than that, He healed and
delivered them and even fed them! But there is one thing Jesus never
did...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-appeal&#34;&gt;No Appeal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not a single record of Jesus following His teaching with an
appeal for people to become disciples. No one is invited to pray a
sinner&amp;rsquo;s prayer. In fact when we examine Jesus&#39; approach to
&amp;ldquo;soul-winning&amp;rdquo; it is rather shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example His preaching in Nazareth which Luke tells us about in
some detail. Jesus had already gained a reputation in Capernaum and the
people gathered in the synagogue are eager to hear Him for themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about
him spread through the whole countryside. He taught in their
synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he
had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the
synagogue, as was his custom ... All spoke well of him and were
amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this
Joseph&amp;rsquo;s son?&amp;rdquo; they asked. (Lk 4:14-22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is full of the power of the Spirit; He has their rapt attention;
they are hanging on His every word. All Jesus needs to do is to urge
them to turn their hearts to God, confess their sin and ask for
forgiveness. Jesus Himself can forgive them there and then. What a
harvest to celebrate at the start of His ministry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no. With no provocation from the congregation Jesus first accuses
them of scepticism and then provokes them to fury with a pointed telling
of a couple of stories from the scripture. As a result He is thrown out
and their hearts are turned against Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any evangelist that behaves like this deserves to be thrown out and can
be sure they will not get a repeat invitation! But isn&amp;rsquo;t Jesus supposed
to be our model? John the Baptist did the same, baiting the Pharisees
saying &amp;ldquo;who warned you to flee the wrath to come? &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Jesus and John were more likely to provoke an adverse reaction from
their congregation than make an emotional appeal to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-says-go-home-not-come-follow-me&#34;&gt;Jesus says &amp;ldquo;Go home&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;Come follow me&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this example from Nazareth is more dramatic than the other
examples recorded for us, it is nevertheless fairly typical. We assume
that if someone actually came to us asking for healing, deliverance or
to obtain peace with God, we should urge them follow Jesus. But Jesus
never seemed to do so. Usually, after Jesus has engaged with someone in
healing, or forgiveness, He tells them to go on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus asked her, &amp;ldquo;Has no-one condemned you?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;No-one, sir,&amp;rdquo; she said.
&amp;ldquo;Then neither do I condemn you,&amp;rdquo; Jesus declared. &amp;ldquo;Go now and leave
your life of sin.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 8:10-11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Go,&amp;rdquo; said Jesus, &amp;ldquo;your faith has healed you.&amp;rdquo; (Mk 10:52)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the woman, &amp;ldquo;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.&amp;rdquo; (Lk
7:50)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do know that Jesus called the Twelve to follow Him, but apart from
them we are more likely to see Jesus putting people off from following
Him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And
he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he
who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.&amp;rdquo;
(Matt 10:37-38)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, &amp;ldquo;I will follow
you wherever you go.&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;Foxes have holes and birds of
the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.&amp;rdquo;
He said to another man, &amp;ldquo;Follow me.&amp;rdquo; But the man replied, &amp;ldquo;Lord, first
let me go and bury my father.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Let the dead bury
their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo; Still
another said, &amp;ldquo;I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and
say good-bye to my family.&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;No-one who puts his hand
to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of
God.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 9:57-62)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. &amp;ldquo;Good teacher,&amp;rdquo;
he asked, &amp;ldquo;what must I do to inherit eternal life?&amp;rdquo; ... Jesus
answered ... &amp;ldquo;You know the commandments: &amp;lsquo;Do not murder, do not
commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not
defraud, honour your father and mother.&#39;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Teacher,&amp;rdquo; he declared, &amp;ldquo;all
these I have kept since I was a boy.&amp;rdquo; Jesus looked at him and loved
him. &amp;ldquo;One thing you lack,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Go, sell everything you have and
give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come,
follow me.&amp;rdquo; (Mk 10:17-21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus seemed to simply trust the Holy Spirit to take the words He had
sown through His teaching and to water them until a person decided they
had to seek Jesus out and become a disciple. Jesus did all He could to
prevent people making spur-of-the-moment emotional responses to the
Gospel. If a person did not seek Jesus out and make an effort to become
a disciple, they would not become a disciple at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;change-your-ways&#34;&gt;Change your ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we to conclude then that Jesus preached a wishy-washy feel-good
Gospel and didn&amp;rsquo;t bother with sin and repentance? Not at all. Jesus was
quite clear that He came to save sinners, and that repentance was
required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.&amp;rdquo;
(Lk 5:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus even sought out people He had previously healed to warn them to
turn from sin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, &amp;ldquo;See, you are
well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.&amp;rdquo; (Jn
5:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them&amp;mdash;do
you think they were more guilty than all the others living in
Jerusalem? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all
perish.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 13:4-5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that Jesus&amp;rsquo; Gospel was not a wishy-washy &amp;ldquo;God loves you all.
Just smile at the cat and you will get to heaven&amp;rdquo;. Far from it. Jesus&amp;rsquo;s
Gospel was so challenging that it led his disciples to ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?&amp;quot; And He said to
them, &amp;quot;Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you,
will seek to enter and will not be able.&amp;quot; (Lk 13:23-24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-proper-response-to-the-gospel&#34;&gt;The Proper Response to the Gospel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John baptised those who repented as did Jesus&#39; disciples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptising more
disciples than John although in fact it was not Jesus who baptised,
but his disciples. (Jn 4:1-2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Gospels and Acts tell us that baptism is the appropriate
response to the message, not praying some prayer. If a person will not
follow up their response to the Gospel with baptism then what is the
response worth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;purpose-not-method&#34;&gt;Purpose, not Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hundreds of disciples that followed Jesus before his death knew
nothing about Jesus dying to save them from their sins. They simply
believed that Jesus was sent by God to usher in the new age of the
kingdom of God and were baptised on that basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying mechanism of this new age was not something that Jesus
mentioned until the Last Supper. It required Paul in applying his great
biblical knowledge and remarkable intellect along with spiritual
revelation to bring an explanation of how the good news of the kingdom
was brought about by the death and resurrection of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to have become fixated on this explanation of the means of our
salvation rather than following the focus that Jesus and the rest of the
New Testament gives to the Gospel. That focus is on the relationship we
can have with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s as if we were fixated on the engine under the bonnet of a car,
rather than on the car itself. The whole point of a car is to get you
from A to B. Of course it is perfectly true that without a reliable
engine it won&amp;rsquo;t get you there, but the engine is not the focus. In fact,
you don&amp;rsquo;t have to know anything about the engine, nor do you ever have
to see it to benefit from its power. The Cross is the essential power of
the gospel, but not its point. When we focus on the cross instead of on
our relationship with God, we focus on something that Jesus did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipleship is all about relationship with God and a driving desire to
develop that relationship. There is no way a person is going to go on
with God unless that relationship is an all-important desire. No amount
of teaching about heaven and hell will cause a person to deny themselves
and follow Jesus. If it is not enough to make a Christian share the
Gospel with their friends how could it convince an unbeliever to refocus
their entire life around obedience to Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusion from this study is that evangelism should consist mostly
of demonstrations of the Kingdom through healing, deliverance and
prayers of blessings for people. We should tell people that Jesus came
to deliver us from the power of Satan who seeks to destroy our lives and
tell them that they can have a personal relationship with God. We should
also tell them something of the cost and difficulties of discipleship.
If they are interested we can tell them more or invite them to join a
Growth Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that if people do not ask, &amp;ldquo;How then can anyone be saved&amp;rdquo; or
&amp;ldquo;Are only a few saved?&amp;rdquo; then we are not preaching as Jesus did! (See Lk
14:26-33 &amp;hellip; unless you &amp;hellip; you cannot be my disciple)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should follow the teaching of the New Testament in offering baptism
as the way a person expresses their commitment to Christ, and NOT use
the sinner&amp;rsquo;s prayer until the moment of baptism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our evangelistic meetings, having explained about the New Kingdom, we
should try to put people off rather than try to persuade them to follow
Jesus. We should tell them how they are blinded by Satan and how
half-hearted followers make Jesus sick (this should help to put off the
proud and arrogant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should warn them that following Jesus in a selfish and corrupt world
is a big challenge that most Christians find difficult. Jesus Himself
died on the cross and most of the apostles also died horrible deaths as
martyrs. Christians in every age have suffered terrible persecution and
shared the common fate of man in the trials and troubles of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to be truthful and honest about the realities of our
relationship with Jesus. It is not an easy relationship to develop; it
takes discipline, determination and courage. We also need to be clear
about the joys of that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not ask people to respond to the gospel by praying a prayer of
commitment. By all means offer a prayer asking God to convict them of
their sin and of their need for Him (that is something Jesus said the
Holy Spirit would do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should offer baptism soon after the evangelistic meeting (perhaps the
next day or the following week) as a means for people who continue to
want to follow Jesus to respond and receive the Holy Spirit. Prior to
baptism we should again attempt to put the person off and ensure they
understand that coming to Jesus means renouncing all other spirits,
ancestor worship, secret societies, attempts to contact the dead,
African signs and superstition. Jesus represents the Kingdom of Light
where nothing in our lives or hearts is hidden from Him.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Gospel of the Kingdom</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/evangelism/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/evangelism/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-gospel-of-the-kingdom&#34;&gt;The Gospel of the Kingdom&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus and the apostles preached and demonstrated a Gospel centred on the
Kingdom of God. The cross was &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the focus of their Gospel; their
focus was the announcement that God&#39;s Kingdom had come, and that Jesus
was God&#39;s appointed and anointed King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-jesus-proclaimed&#34;&gt;The Gospel Jesus Proclaimed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was particularly clear, that He had come to overthrow the kingdom
of darkness and establish His Kingdom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt; is the time for judgment on this world; &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt; the prince of
this world will be driven out.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 12:31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be no doubt that Jesus considered healing and deliverance to
be central to His mission. He could have talked about forgiveness, about
God&#39;s love or God&#39;s priority for relationship with Him rather than
religious observance. But this is how Jesus described His mission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and
tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 13:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important for us to understand &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Jesus healed the
sick and drove out demons. Many people have assumed that it was to prove
that He was God&#39;s Son. But that is not the reason Jesus gives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of
God has come upon you.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 11:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a fuller understanding of Jesus&#39; Gospel, look at His announcement
at the start of His ministry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach
good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the
prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the
oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favour.&amp;rdquo; ... he began
by saying to them, &amp;ldquo;Today this scripture is fulfilled in your
hearing.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 4:16-21 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see clearly that the Gospel is about setting people free from
the oppression of Satan. It is the announcement of Satan&#39;s defeat and
God&#39;s favour towards His children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice, that the Gospel is NOT the announcement of warfare against
Satan, but the bold assertion and demonstration that he has been bound
and defeated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.&amp;quot; (Mark
1:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you
authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the
power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.&amp;rdquo; (Lk 10:18-19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the
kingdom of God has come upon you. Or again, how can anyone enter a
strong man&amp;rsquo;s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties
up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.&amp;quot; (Matt 12:28-29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important for us to see that Jesus did not claim to be
healing and delivering by His own power, as the Messiah, but that it was
the Father working in Him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in
me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, &lt;strong&gt;it is the
Father, living in me, who is doing his work&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 10:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we see clearly that Jesus views the Good News &amp;ndash; the Gospel &amp;ndash; as
God&#39;s victorious Kingdom now being established on earth, in the lives
of God&#39;s children. And because of this Jesus makes a wonderful
invitation and promise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you
rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and
humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is
easy and my burden is light.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 11:28-30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this invitation we see a call to repentance (&amp;quot;Come to me...&amp;quot;
involves turning away from ones past) and a call to discipleship (&amp;quot;Take
my yoke upon you and learn from me&amp;quot;). A Growth Group is the ideal place
for someone to respond to this invitation and become a disciple. It is
also a very &amp;quot;light burden&amp;quot; compared to telling someone they must go to
church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-the-apostles-proclaimed&#34;&gt;The Gospel the Apostle&#39;s Proclaimed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least 17 descriptions of the Gospel in the Acts. Here is
the complete list with the sermons in bold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 2:10; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 2:17, 21, 23, 36, 38;&lt;/strong&gt; Acts 4:29-31; Acts 5:41;
&lt;strong&gt;Acts 7;&lt;/strong&gt; Acts 8:5-7, 12; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 10:36-38, 42-43;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 13:32,
38-39;&lt;/strong&gt; Acts 14:3; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 14:15&lt;/strong&gt;, 22; Acts 16:30-31; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 17:7, 16,
18, 30-31;&lt;/strong&gt; Acts 18:5; Acts 19:8; Acts 20:21; Acts 26:17-18; Acts
28:8-9; Acts 28:23, 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, at least 11 emphasise Jesus as Messiah or King. Only three
descriptions of the Gospel include forgiveness of sins! The others
emphasise turning to God in faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice in Acts we hear what Jesus instructed the apostles to proclaim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that &lt;strong&gt;he is the
one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead&lt;/strong&gt;. (Acts
10:42-43)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am sending you to them to open their eyes and &lt;strong&gt;turn them from
darkness to light&lt;/strong&gt;, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they
may &lt;strong&gt;receive forgiveness of sins&lt;/strong&gt; and a place among those who are
sanctified by faith in me.&amp;quot; (Acts 26:17-18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again we see a strong Kingdom emphasis. Jesus is the ruler and judge,
and people need to turn from the kingdom and power of darkness to the
Kingdom of Light and forgiveness. Further insight comes from Paul&#39;s
preaching in Greece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They are all defying Caesar&amp;rsquo;s decrees, saying that &lt;strong&gt;there is
another king, one called Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;... Paul was &lt;strong&gt;preaching the good
news about Jesus and the resurrection&lt;/strong&gt;. ... &amp;quot;He commands all people
everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when &lt;strong&gt;he will judge the
world with justice&lt;/strong&gt; by the man he has appointed. He has given proof
of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.&amp;quot; (Acts 17:7, 16, 18,
30-31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the cross of Christ was vital to the Kingdom of God, the focus
of Gospel proclamation is on Jesus as the Messiah/King and the
resurrection as the proof that Jesus is alive and reigning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 5:41 Day after day from house to house, they never stopped
proclaiming &lt;strong&gt;the good news that Jesus is the Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 8:5-7, 12 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and &lt;strong&gt;proclaimed
the Messiah&lt;/strong&gt; there ... when they believed Philip as &lt;strong&gt;he proclaimed
the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ&lt;/strong&gt;,
they were baptized, both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts 28:23, 31 He witnessed to them from morning till evening,
&lt;strong&gt;explaining about the kingdom of God&lt;/strong&gt;, ... he tried to persuade
them about Jesus. ... He &lt;strong&gt;proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught
about the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-is-the-cross&#34;&gt;Where is the Cross?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament letters make it abundantly clear that the Cross of
Christ is how we are forgiven and brought into God&#39;s family. Yet the
cross rarely appears in the New Testament descriptions or preaching of
the Gospel to unbelievers. One way to understand this is to think of the
Gospel as a car that can rescue people from a fire or a flood. The Cross
is like the engine in the car. Without an engine, a car is useless, no
matter how nice it looks inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that we arrive at the scene of disaster and urge people to get
into the car so we can take them to safety. We don&#39;t need to lift the
hood and show them the engine before they get in the car. They don&#39;t
need to know how the engine works, or anything about it. But without the
engine they cannot be saved. After they have been driven to safety, they
might want to know what made the car go so fast. Then we can show them
the engine and explain how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel would be empty and pointless words without Jesus&#39; death on
the Cross and His resurrection. But people don&#39;t need to know anything
about the Cross in order to be saved. All they need to know is that
Jesus is King and Judge and that He loves them and can save them if they
repent and put their trust in Him. Later they can learn about the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an engine needs fuel to power it. Without fuel, the engine is
useless. The Holy Spirit is the fuel that powers the Cross. It is by the
Holy Spirit that we are Born Again and made into God&#39;s children. It is
the Holy Spirit that changes people&#39;s cold and rebellious hearts and
enables them to believe and trust in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel is completely dependent upon both the Cross of Christ and the
work of the Holy Spirit. But when we share the Gospel with an
unbeliever, we do not need to explain either the Cross or the working of
the Holy Spirit. Remember that the Gospel is the power of God for
salvation (Romans 1:16), not the theological explanation of how God
enabled salvation to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-of-power&#34;&gt;The Gospel of Power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospels and Acts are united in presenting the Gospel as &amp;quot;Jesus has
bound Satan and His Kingdom of freedom and forgiveness is here now for
those who believe&amp;quot;. When we listen to the Gospels and to Acts we must
conclude that the Gospel cannot be separated from healing and
deliverance. Paul was insistent that a powerless gospel was no gospel at
all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words,
but with a demonstration of the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s power, so that your faith
might not rest on human wisdom, but on God&amp;rsquo;s power.&amp;quot; (1 Cor 2:4-5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.&amp;quot; (1 Cor
4:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, when the disciples are praying for effective Gospel witness,
they pray for healing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak
your word with great boldness. &lt;strong&gt;Stretch out your hand to heal and
perform signs and wonders&lt;/strong&gt; through the name of your holy servant
Jesus.&amp;quot; After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was
shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the
word of God boldly. (Acts 4:29-31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God answered their prayer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Lord confirmed the message of his grace by &lt;strong&gt;enabling them to
perform signs and wonders&lt;/strong&gt; ... (Acts 14:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-foolishness-of-the-gospel&#34;&gt;The Foolishness of the Gospel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given us intelligence and minds that like to understand the
world we live in. It is natural that we try to proclaim the Gospel in a
way that makes sense to people, and that sounds reasonable. But our
reasoning and intelligence has been corrupted by the fall, so that what
is reasonable to God looks like foolishness to us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not
know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached
to save those who believe. (1 Cor 1:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This very important scripture tells us that people do not get to know
God through understanding a reasonable Gospel, but through faith in what
seems to be a foolish Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is writing about Jesus being crucified as appearing foolish to the
Jews and Greeks. But that is not the only aspect of the Gospel that
appears foolish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses
their life for me will find it.&amp;quot; (Matthew 16:25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you
have no life in you.&amp;quot; (John 6:53)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If anyone says to this mountain, &amp;lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,&amp;rsquo;
and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will
happen, it will be done for them.&amp;quot; (Mark 11:23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said many things that appear foolish to the natural mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come
from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot
understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. (1
Cor 2:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen in this study that Jesus instructs us to preach healing for
the sick as the starting point for the Gospel, but this appears foolish
to us because not everyone we pray for is healed immediately &amp;ndash; they may
not be healed at all. Preaching sight for the blind when the blind
remain blind makes us appear foolish. But we must accept that Jesus&#39;
wisdom is greater than our foolishness. We must continue to proclaim the
gospel Jesus gave us, because that foolish Gospel is the power of God
for salvation to those who are being saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-explained&#34;&gt;The Gospel Explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having highlighted the foolishness of the Gospel, we must not deny the
importance of explanation. Jesus almost certainly spent more time
talking and explaining than healing, as did the apostles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews
that Jesus was the Messiah. (Acts 18:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months,
arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. (Acts 19:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young man named Eutychus sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked on
and on. (Acts 20:9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking and explaining things clearly are very important. Understanding
the things of God is important. But &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; is not defined by what seems
reasonable to us. &amp;quot;Let God be true, and every man a liar.&amp;quot; (Romans
3:4). We must remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.&amp;quot; (1 Cor
4:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-gospel&#34;&gt;Our Gospel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us? We must be honest and admit that we have
mostly reversed Pauls&#39; claim and said, &amp;quot;The kingdom of God is not a
matter of power but of talk.&amp;quot; This is surely our biggest challenge &amp;ndash;
for pastors and for every disciple of Jesus. Will we commit ourselves to
pursuing the Gospel of the Kingdom &amp;ndash; the &amp;quot;foolish&amp;quot; Gospel of Powerful
deliverance and healing and transformation? Or will we settle for a
&amp;quot;reasonable&amp;quot; gospel of words and well-wishing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must NOT fall into the trap of thinking that understanding and
explaining the gospel is the same as genuine proclamation. We are only
being obedient to Jesus&#39; command and commission if we proclaim the
Gospel of the Kingdom with healing and deliverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said this, we must continue to be honest and admit that most of
us experience a great deal of frustration and failure in this respect.
That is why this question is so important. Will we give up and accept
defeat, or keep trying because obedience and trust is more important to
us than our own comfort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where leadership and fellowship are so important. Let us commit
together to proclaim the Gospel of the Kingdom, with healing and
deliverance and to keep at it until we hear Jesus say, &amp;quot;Well done, good
and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of your Master.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-in-four-words&#34;&gt;The Gospel in Four Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freedom:&lt;/strong&gt; God wants to break the power of evil over your life and set
you free to know His love for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus:&lt;/strong&gt; He sent His Son Jesus to show us the way and make this
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repentance:&lt;/strong&gt; He invites you to turn from your own ways and put your
trust completely in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baptism:&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to make this complete change in your life, you
must die to what you have been and let God give you His new life. We
call this baptism...&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/evangelism/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom-for-gentiles/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-gospel-of-the-kingdom&#34;&gt;The Gospel of the Kingdom&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;grasping-for-hope&#34;&gt;Grasping for hope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all hope for a better future. That is why we educate ourselves. It is
why people want to go to university. It is why people vote in elections.
It is why we take risks. Without hope we would just give up and die!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every culture offers its own pathway to a better future. In traditional
rural cultures it often involves ancestor worship and sacrificial
offerings. In tribal cultures it often involves obtaining a dominant
position over competing tribes. In religious cultures it usually
involves some sort of self-cleansing and penance. In secular cultures it
often involves the accumulation of wealth and the domination of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that there are many different ways in which people seek to
improve their lives. God is also interested in this. He created us,
loves us and wants our lives to be fruitful and blessed. He wants your
life to be fruitful and blessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frustrated-by-sin&#34;&gt;Frustrated by Sin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our lives are made difficult because of sin. The sin of countless
generations before us has created great injustice and imbalance in the
world. The sin of our governments has resulted in broken economies and
widespread injustice. Sin in our communities results in people being
cheated and ill-treated. Sin in our families results in arguments and
fights and deep emotional pain. We have individually and corporately
messed up our world and our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do we turn for help and guidance? We look to our own reason &amp;ndash;
trying to make sense of the situation and work out a way forward. We
turn to our family and friends for advice. We turn to our culture and
traditions for wisdom. We look both inward and outward to the things we
can perceive and try to make the best choice we can. But God is not far
from any of us. And He sees what we can never see. He also sees the
big-picture; how our actions affect those around us and those who will
come after us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;light-from-above&#34;&gt;Light from Above&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Good News of the Gospel is that God has broken into our dark and
confused world by sending His Son Jesus to live and die as a man. He was
rejected by many and suffered terrible injustice, resulting in His
murder by being nailed to a tree and left to die. But God raised Him up
from death and Jesus is now alive and reigns over the Kingdom of God all
over the world today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can choose to continue to try and find our own way, as we always have
done, or we can put our trust in God and follow Jesus&#39; way. But we
cannot pick and choose. Jesus does not just offer a few other choices we
can pick from. If we want the light of Jesus in our lives we need to
turn our backs on all other voices and listen only to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is Jesus&#39; call &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Repent; turn around. Believe the Truth that is
Jesus Christ. Turn your back on all other claims of wisdom and light and
trust only in Jesus as your Light.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;becoming-a-child-of-god&#34;&gt;Becoming a child of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God welcomes all who put their whole trust in Jesus. We need to become
God&amp;rsquo;s children through being baptised in water and baptised in the Holy
Spirit. In the water we die to our old way of living and thinking and
all the sin and curses of our past are cut off forever. Then we rise up
as a new person, God&amp;rsquo;s holy child, and receive the transforming and
empowering Holy Spirit. He becomes our teacher and guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-narrow-way&#34;&gt;The Narrow Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in the Light of Jesus is counter-cultural. It often leads to
great blessing but it also leads to great challenges; Jesus was rejected
and killed! This is not the easy path, but it is God&amp;rsquo;s way of love which
brings freedom and healing to our broken world. God dwells in His
children to enable them to bring Jesus&#39; love and healing to others. He
sends us to love one another and to go and make disciples&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Gospel of the Kingdom for Jews</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/evangelism/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom-for-jews/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-gospel-of-the-kingdom&#34;&gt;The Gospel of the Kingdom&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-for-the-jews&#34;&gt;The Gospel for the Jews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout human existence, people have mostly either worshipped false
gods, or tried to ignore God, but it seems that God has always revealed
Himself to a few people. Then, about 4000 years ago, God revealed
Himself to a man called Abraham and gave him a promise, that God would
bless him and through Abraham, God would bless the whole world. The
story of what happed to Abraham and his descendants is very interesting
and important because God used them to create a story which shows us how
we too can come to know God and share in the promise God gave to Abraham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that God will bless us and make us a blessing to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told Abraham to leave his home and travel to a distant land which God
would give to his descendants - that was the land we now call Israel.
Abraham had a son, Isaac and Isaac had a son called Jacob and Jacob had
twelve sons who became the fathers of the twelve tribes of Israel. Then
because of a great famine the whole family moved to Egypt where there
was fertile farmland, and there they became a great people. But because
of their number and prosperity they were enslaved by the Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So God revealed Himself to a man called Moses and used him to lead the
people out of slavery. Their enslavement had been a gradual process
which they had adjusted to and many were prepared to accept in return
for the security it gave them. Moses had quite a task to persuade his
fellow Israelites that they should leave all this behind and risk an
uncertain journey to an unknown destination for the promise of a better
future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God planned for this historical physical journey to be a picture of the
spiritual journey each of us is invited to make from living in the
&amp;quot;kingdom&amp;quot; of the world to becoming one of God&#39;s people, living here
on earth as part of God&#39;s Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, pursued by the Egyptian army. God
miraculously parted the Red Sea to let the Israelites through, but the
Egyptian army was drowned. By going through the Red Sea the people were
cut off from their past and their slavery was ended. From there, Moses
led the people into the land God had originally promised to Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the people were now free from the Egyptians and living in their
own land, they were not free from the corruption of their human nature.
The strong and powerful took advantage of the poor and weak. Selfishness
and greed played their familiar part and for the most part they ignored
God and lived lives that were just as messed up and unhappy as they had
been in Egypt. The people had many religious practices but none of these
impressed God. God wanted His people to love one another and provide
justice for the oppressed and mercy for those who had messed up but
wanted to reform their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the years since Abraham, God had sent prophets saying that
one day God would send a special messenger who would give us a new way
of knowing God. That messenger was Jesus, and the new way of knowing God
was through having our hearts changed by God. With changed hearts
obedience to God&#39;s good ways would become natural for us and we would
have the courage to stand against wrong. Wonderful as this message
sounded, it was not going to be well received by the rich and powerful
leaders of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus&#39; life and His message would mirror the journey of the Israelites
fleeing Egypt. Jesus preached very boldly about things which made people
feel very uncomfortable - and they still do. Jesus said that this world
was under the influence of the Devil; He called it the &amp;quot;Kingdom of
Darkness&amp;quot; and contrasted it with God&#39;s kingdom, the &amp;quot;Kingdom of
Light&amp;quot;. Jesus came as Light from God to show people the way out of
Darkness into God&#39;s Kingdom, of Light, just like Moses had led Israel
out of slavery in Egypt into the Promised Land. Jesus also spoke often
about a coming day of Justice, like a global court-hearing when everyone
of us, whether living or long-since dead, would be called to answer to
God for how we have lived our lives. Jesus said that those who love
Truth need have no fear of coming to Jesus and becoming part of God&#39;s
Kingdom, but those who want to hide their lives from God would flee His
presence. Jesus made it very clear that it was not religious people that
pleased God, but obedient people; people who believed that Jesus was God
Himself come as a man, and who allowed Jesus the King to influence and
direct their lives for the blessing of others. It was through Jesus and
those who become His disciples today that God would fulfil the original
promise He made to Abraham; that God would bless him and through him
bless the whole world. And that, in a nut-shell is what it means to be a
Christian; to become one of God&#39;s people through obedience to Jesus, so
that we can receive God&#39;s abundant blessings and share those blessings
with those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the religious leaders of Jesus&#39; day did not like the way He
was challenging their cosy self-serving hypocrisy and they staged a
kangaroo court with trumped-up charges and had Jesus executed by nailing
Him to a cross. But God raised Jesus from the grave and after meeting
with more than 500 people over a period of 40 days, Jesus was taken into
God&#39;s presence where He lives and reigns as the King of the Kingdom of
God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have nearly, but not quite reached the end of the story. The prophets
had said that when God&#39;s special messenger came, He would also change
people&#39;s hearts. Jesus said this would happen after He returned to
Heaven when God would pour the Holy Spirit into the hearts of those who
lived with Jesus as their King. This happened to the first disciples,
transforming them from fearful nobodies into bold witnesses to the
resurrection of Jesus and of His power to heal and transform lives.
Sadly, countless people have misrepresented Jesus by turning his message
into one of joyless religious observance. Nevertheless, the transforming
power of the Holy Spirit is still available for all who want to turn
from the kingdom of Darkness to God&#39;s Kingdom of Light. Jesus said that
in order to live in God&#39;s light we must leave behind our old way of
living (just like the Israelites leaving Egypt), put our trust in Jesus
(like the Israelites following Moses), be baptised in water (like the
Israelites passing through the Red Sea) and then be baptized in the Holy
Spirit. He promises then to set us free from our past (like the Egyptian
Army drowning in the Red Sea) and lead us by His empowering Spirit into
an adventure with Jesus (like the Israelites entering the Promised
Land), where we learn to live like Him and do what He did.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Letter to the Galatians</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/nt-wright/the-letter-to-the-galatians/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Letter to the Galatians: Exegesis and Theology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Originally published in &lt;em&gt;Between Two Horizons: Spanning New Testament
Studies and Systematic Theology&lt;/em&gt; Joel B. Green and Max Turner, eds.,
2000, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 205&amp;ndash;36. Reproduced by permission of the
author.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N. T. WRIGHT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dense and dramatic argument of Galatians excites and baffles by
turns.  Sometimes perceived as a flamboyant younger sister of the more
settled and reflective letter to Rome, this epistle has provoked endless
controversy at all levels, from details of exegesis to flights of
systematic theology.  Nobody reading it can be in any doubt that it all
mattered very much indeed to Paul.  But what it was that mattered, and
why, and why it should matter to anyone two thousand years later &amp;mdash;
these are far harder questions to answer.  Nor can this chapter do more
than restate the questions and hint at possible answers.  Our aim here
is not to solve the problems in question but to discuss and illustrate
the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to discuss, particularly, what might happen when we allow
questions of exegesis and theology to stare each other in the face.  It
is of course generally recognized that anyone grappling with the
exegesis of Galatians must do business with &amp;ldquo;theological&amp;rdquo; questions. 
One must, that is to say, know something of the grammar of theological
concepts, how God-language works (particularly, how it worked in the
first century), how justification might relate to law and faith, and so
on.  One must, in particular, be familiar with how Paul uses similar
ideas in other letters, in this case especially Romans.  It is not that
one should allow Paul&amp;rsquo;s meaning in one place to determine ahead of time
what he might have said elsewhere, but that even if development, or a
change of mind, has occurred, we are still dealing with the same person
talking about more or less the same things.  Equally, no systematic or
practical theology that would claim to be Christian can ignore the
central and foundational texts of the NT.  Particularly, anyone offering
a theological account of, say, justification would feel bound at least
to make a visit to Galatians and to fit it somehow into the developing
scheme.  And anyone wanting to offer a serious Christian account of
central topics on contemporary applied theology &amp;mdash; liberation, for
instance, or postmodernity &amp;mdash; ought, if such theology is to be fully
Christian, to ground their reflections in the NT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a good deal of historical and exegetical scholarship on this
letter, as on others, has in fact proceeded in recent decades with only
minimal attention to theological discussion &amp;mdash; an omission sometimes
justified on the grounds of maintaining historical neutrality, though
sometimes in fact masking the historian&amp;rsquo;s unawareness of the deeper
issues involved.  Likewise, many systematic theologians, in this and
other fields, have become impatient with waiting for the mountain of
historical footnotes to give birth to the mouse of theological insight,
and have proceeded on the basis of an understanding of the text that
simply reflects, it may not be too unkind to say, either the commentary
that was in vogue when the theologian was a student or the pressing
contemporary issues that condition a particular reading of the
text.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[1]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend in this essay to approach the problem from both ends, and to
examine the bridge that might be thrown between these two now
traditional positions.  This task is not to be thought of as one element
in the wider project of bridging Lessing&amp;rsquo;s Ugly Ditch. Such a project
presupposes that which ought to be challenged &amp;mdash; namely, the existence
of such a ditch in the first place.  To be sure, a ditch between the
historical and the theological task does indeed exist within Western
consciousness, and the rise of historical scholarship owes something to
it, since in that context the ditch has acted as a moat, protecting the
historian from the prying eye and the heavy hand of the theological
censor.  But the question always arises as to who is being protected
from whom.  The ditch is equally useful to those who want to maintain a
traditional faith within a pure ahistorical vacuum.  But the idea that
there is a great gulf fixed between historical exegesis and Christian
theology &amp;mdash; this Enlightenment presupposition is precisely what ought
to be challenged, not least when commenting on a biblical text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of hinting at answers to the wider problems is to read a
particular text without bracketing off any of these questions &amp;mdash; or, to
put the matter another way, one might propose putting to the text the
questions that have accrued, and those that are newly emerging, out of
the long history of the church&amp;rsquo;s engagement with its own faith (and, one
should say, with its God) &amp;mdash; and giving the text a chance to answer
them, or at least to insist on their rewording.  With this in mind, I
offer here (1) a brief account of the major exegetical issues that meet
us in Galatians; (2) a suggestion of which major theological questions
might profitably be put to the letter, and what answers might arise; and
(3) some proposals about how these two tasks might be brought into
fruitful interaction with one another through the work of a commentary
and the further work (not least preaching) that a commentary is supposed
to evoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Exegetical Issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic task of exegesis is to address, as a whole and in parts, the
historical questions: What was the author saying to the readers; and
why?  These questions ultimately demand an answer at the broadest level
in the form of a hypothesis to be tested against the verse-by-verse
details.  One may, perhaps, allow the author some imprecision,
particularly in such a heated composition, but if even a small number of
details do not fit the hypothesis, it will be called into question. 
Exegetes of course have ways of making things fit.  A puzzling verse can
be labeled as a pre-Pauline fragment or an interpolation, or perhaps a
mere &amp;ldquo;topos&amp;rdquo; in which a well-worn phrase, whose history-of-religions
ancestry can be shown with an impressive footnote, should not be pressed
for precise or powerful meaning.  (As though Paul, of all people, would
be content to write a letter that was merely a set of conventional
noises whose meaning could thus be reduced to a set of evocative
grunts!)  Failing that, one can suggest that a puzzling verse simply
reflects a moment where either Paul or his amanuensis lost the train of
thought.  But I take it as a general rule, consonant with the wider
rules for hypotheses and their verification, that the more moves like
this one makes, the more one&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis stands condemned for lack of
appropriate simplicity.  One must assume that there is a train of
thought, &amp;ldquo;that the text has a central concern and a remarkable inner
logic that may no longer be entirely comprehensible to
us.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[2]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; One
must get in the data, and one must do so without undue complexity,
without using that brute force which swaggers around the byways of a
text arm-in-arm with ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the level of large-scale exegesis, this problem meets us when we ask
the questions normally thought of under the heading &amp;ldquo;Introduction.&amp;rdquo; 
What was going on in Galatia that made Paul write the letter?  Which
&amp;ldquo;Galatia&amp;rdquo; (north or south) are we talking about anyway?  When did Paul
write the letter?  What relation, if any, did the episode have to the
so-called &amp;ldquo;apostolic conference&amp;rdquo; of Acts 15?  Who were Paul&amp;rsquo;s opponents,
the shadowy &amp;ldquo;agitators&amp;rdquo; who flit to and fro through the undergrowth of
the epistle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One well-worn path through these thickets has been made by those who
insist that the agitators are legalists: proto-Pelagians who are trying
to persuade the Galatians to seek justification by performing good moral
deeds.  Among the many problems this view faces is the question, Why
then does Paul spend so long, in chapter 5 in particular, warning the
Galatians against what looks like antinomianism?  It will scarcely do to
say (though many have) that he has suddenly focused on a quite different
problem, with perhaps a quite different set of opponents or agitators. 
A different basic analysis seems called for &amp;mdash; one that will hold the
two emphases of the letter (if that is what they are) in a single larger
context, and that will perhaps question whether what appear to our
post-Enlightenment and post-Reformation eyes as two separate, almost
incompatible, emphases, would have appeared like that to either Paul or
his readers.  And any such analysis must face the question from the
theologian, and from those (such as preachers) who look to theologians&#39;
work for help: Of what use are these &amp;ldquo;introductory&amp;rdquo; questions for
theology?  Since two hundred years of research has failed to solve them,
is there not something to be said for bracketing them and going straight
into reading the text?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similarly large-scale question to be addressed is, Why does Paul spend
so long recounting his early visits to Jerusalem and his meeting with
the apostles there?  Almost one-quarter of the letter (1:10-2:21, 36
verses out of 149) is devoted to this subject, and there may be further
echoes of the subject elsewhere (e.g., 4:25).  Many readers have, of
course, bypassed this question, regarding material prior to 2:11 as
&amp;ldquo;introduction&amp;rdquo; and seeing what follows as the beginning of a systematic
theological exposition of the doctrine of justification.  But Paul at
least reckoned it necessary to preface the body of the letter
with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; introduction rather than something else; and, since his
introductions are normally good indicators of the main thrust of the
letter, we should at least make the attempt to investigate the possible
integration of the first two chapters with what follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question that relates to this but has recently taken on a life of its
own (particularly since the appearance twenty-five years ago of the
commentary by H.-D. Betz) is, To what rhetorical genre does the letter
belong?&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[3]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; Is
it deliberative, apologetic, or
what?&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[4]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
It has, I believe, been good for Pauline exegetes to be reminded that
Paul wrote from within the wider world of Greco-Roman late antiquity,
where there were well-known literary forms and genres that would, in
themselves, give off clues as to what the writer thought he (or, less
likely, she) was doing.  But it is important not to let the literary
tail wag the epistolary dog.  Paul was an innovator, living in two or
more worlds at once, and allowing them &amp;mdash; in his own person, his
vocation, his style of operation, and his writing &amp;mdash; to knock sparks
off each other (or, as it might be, to dovetail together in new
ways). Consideration of literary genre must always remain in dialogue
with the question of what the text actually says.  Neither can claim the
high ground and dictate to the other.  The same is true of the various
forms of structural, or structuralist, analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar points need to be made about the current burgeoning of
social-scientific reading of Paul&amp;rsquo;s
letters.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[5]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
To be sure, Paul and his readers lived within a social context in which
all sorts of pressures and presuppositions operated that are quite
unlike those in modern Western society.  A good many things that have
traditionally been read as abstract ideas or beliefs did in fact come
with heavy agendas attached in the areas of social grouping,
organization, and culture, and we ignore this at our peril. Equally,
recognizing the existence and nonnegotiable importance of the
social-scientific dimension of Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters does not mean denying that
these same letters set out a train of thought that cannot, or at least
cannot &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, be reduced to terms of cryptic social agendas.  Just
because every word and phrase carries a social context and dimension
does not mean that Paul is not setting out a train of thought, a
sequence of ideas.  We must beware, here as elsewhere, of false
antitheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are exactly the sorts of questions, once more, that will tend to
make the theologian impatient.  Of what relevance, people sometimes say
and often think, are these questions for the major and urgent issues
that crowd in upon the church and its proclamation to the world?  The
answer is that each of them demonstrably affects how we read the key
texts for which the theologian or preacher is eager.  The question of
justification by faith itself is intimately bound up with them. Ernst
Käsemann&amp;rsquo;s caustic remark, that those eager for &amp;ldquo;results&amp;rdquo; should keep
their hands off exegesis, comes uncomfortably to
mind.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn6&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[6]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of social context upon exegesis and theology is most
obviously the case with the passage where many will feel that the letter
finally &amp;ldquo;gets going&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; namely, 2:11-21.  The brief and dense statement
about justification in 2:15-21 is part of Paul&amp;rsquo;s description of what
happened between Peter and himself at Antioch; we cannot assume, as many
have done, that because we think we know ahead of time what Paul meant
by &amp;ldquo;justification,&amp;rdquo; we can deduce that precisely this was the subject of
the quarrel (imagining, for instance, that Peter was arguing for a
semi-Pelagian position on the question of how people go to heaven after
death).  Paul&amp;rsquo;s description of the altercation pushes us in quite
another direction.  The question at issue was not, How can individual
sinners find salvation? but rather, Are Christian Jews bound, by the
Jewish kosher laws, to eat separately from Christian Gentiles, or are
they bound by the gospel to eat at the same table with them?  We may and
must assume, indeed, that reflection on these questions would not only
be influenced, in the minds of Peter and the others, by &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo;
intellectual and theological arguments; Paul was asking them to break
the habits not only of a lifetime but of a tightly integrated social
grouping that had survived, precisely by maintaining these habits, for
hundreds of years.  The detailed exegetical debates that have swirled
around these verses have, as often as not, been caused by a sense that
the traditional reading does not quite work, does not quite fit the
words that Paul actually used.  Attention to the wider context on the
one hand, and to theological issues of how the basic concepts function
in general and in Paul in particular, may provide fresh ways forward. 
And if that is so, a Careful reading of this passage in Galatians might
well send shock waves through the reading of other Pauline texts, such
as Romans 3-4 and Philippians 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long argument of 3:1-5:1, which forms the solid center of the
letter, offers almost endless puzzles for the exegete, down to the
meaning of individual words and particles and the question of implicit
punctuation (the early manuscripts, of course, have for the most part
neither punctuation nor breaks between words).  And it is here that the
larger issues of understanding Galatians, the questions that form the
bridge between exegesis, history, and theology, begin to come to light. 
Where does Paul suppose that he stands in relationship to the covenant
that Israel&amp;rsquo;s God made with Abraham?  And to that with Moses?  And to
the Torah, the Jewish law, which, though giving substance to the
historical Mosaic covenant, seems to have taken on a life of its own? 
What, in short, does Paul wish to say about what he himself,
surprisingly perhaps, calls &amp;ldquo;Judaism&amp;rdquo; (1:13)?  Does he see it as a
historical sequence of covenants and promises that have now reached
their fulfillment in Jesus?  Or does he see it as a system to the whole
of which the true God is now saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; in order to break in, through
the gospel, and do a new thing? A further important question, not
usually considered sufficiently: Does Paul&amp;rsquo;s actual handling of the
Jewish Scriptures, in terms of quotation, allusion, and echo, reflect
the view he holds, or do the two stand in
tension?&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[7]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions can, of course, only be resolved by detailed examination
of the text, verse by verse and line by line.  But it is important to
notice here the way in which, classically within the discipline of
Pauline scholarship, two questions, in principle separable, have in fact
been fused together in uncomfortable coexistence. (1) What is
Paul&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;theological&lt;/em&gt; relationship to Judaism? (2) What is
Paul&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;historical&lt;/em&gt; relationship to Judaism?  The two have often been
allowed to spill over into each other.  Thus, if Paul is perceived to
have criticized &amp;ldquo;Judaism&amp;rdquo; (e.g., for its belief in justification by
works of the law), it is assumed that he cannot have derived his basic
ideas from Judaism &amp;mdash; and that therefore the historical origin of his
theology is to be found not in Judaism at all, but either in the Christ
event as a totally new and essentially non-Jewish irruption into the
world or in the pagan systems of religion, cult, and moral philosophy. 
Conversely, if Paul is perceived to stand in a positive relation to
Judaism at the historical level &amp;mdash; i.e., if one supposes that Paul&amp;rsquo;s
basic thought structure and beliefs remained Jewish after his conversion
&amp;mdash; it is often assumed that therefore he can have had no real critique
of &amp;ldquo;Judaism.&amp;rdquo;  Both of these questions, of course, need integration with
wider issues, not least Paul&amp;rsquo;s actual practice in its social setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wishes thus to skate to and fro between history of religions
and theological analysis should be warned that the ice here is
dangerously thin.  Among the key characteristics of Paul&amp;rsquo;s Judaism were
precisely critique from within on the one hand and confrontation with
paganism on the other.  The fact that Paul criticized some aspects of
his native Judaism and that he announced a gospel to the Gentiles does
not mean that he broke with Judaism in order to do so.  On the contrary;
by his own account (to hint for a moment at the solution that I prefer),
he claimed to be speaking as a true Jew, criticizing &amp;mdash; as did many who
made similar claims &amp;mdash; those who embraced other construals of Judaism,
on the basis that Israel&amp;rsquo;s God had now acted climactically and
decisively in Jesus, the Messiah.  For the same reason, he was now
announcing to all the world that the one true God was addressing,
claiming, and redeeming it by the Jewish Messiah, the Lord of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion should be sufficient to show the way in which the
exegetical and theological issues that arise from Galatians 3 and 4 are
bound so closely together that it is impossible to separate them.  But
we should also note the way in which such deliberations have also
invoked, from various angles, the wider contexts both of theology and of
contemporary meaning.  In the church&amp;rsquo;s preaching, the assumption that
Paul was straightforwardly distancing himself from &amp;ldquo;Judaism&amp;rdquo; has had,
notoriously, disastrous effects at social, cultural, political, and
theological levels.  Equally, if it is supposed for a moment that Paul
simply saw himself as a good Jew who merely knew the name of the
Messiah, but otherwise had nothing to add to his Jewish heritage, all
chance of understanding him is lost.  The only way of dealing with
Galatians 3 and 4 is for all these issues to be on the table at the same
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exegetical problem(s) of Galatians 5 and 6 grow out of, and
contribute further to, these questions, but add extra ones of their
own.  Lulled perhaps by a belief that Paul follows the Enlightenment&amp;rsquo;s
division of theory and practice, of theology and ethics, many have
simply supposed that the &amp;ldquo;theology&amp;rdquo; of the letter is now finished and
that all that remains are some guidelines as to how to behave.  But to
approach the chapters thus is to be further puzzled.  Paul does not say
quite what (from this perspective) we would expect.  His key statements
are not of the form &amp;ldquo;this, then, is how to behave,&amp;rdquo; but instead things
like &amp;ldquo;if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law&amp;rdquo; (5:18)
and &amp;ldquo;those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh&amp;rdquo; (5:24).  The
detailed instructions of 6:1-10 (which, if they have a connecting theme,
are still not so tightly sewn together as the previous argument)
continue to refer not to a general need for the Galatians to behave in a
proper fashion, but rather to a particular social situation within which
certain styles of behavior are particularly appropriate.  And the letter
closes with a strong statement of the basic point that, arguably, Paul
has been making all through: Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
matters, since what matters is new creation.  What, then, does Paul&amp;rsquo;s
&amp;ldquo;ethics,&amp;rdquo; if we should call it that, have to do with the fundamental
thrust of the letter as a whole?  This exegetical problem is of course
of huge interest to theologians, but it will not be solved by broad
generalizations that sit loose to the detail of the text, or to its
historical and social origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Contributions to Systematic Theology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this brief review of the exegetical problems of the letter, it is
now time to approach the matter from the other end.  What theological
issues might we hope to see advanced by the study of this text, and what
problems face us as we press such questions?  We shall maintain, for the
purpose of this article, a traditional distinction between &amp;ldquo;systematic&amp;rdquo;
and &amp;ldquo;practical&amp;rdquo; theology, although in today&amp;rsquo;s practice such things are
increasingly merged together.  In both cases all we can do is to note
some possible questions out of the many that could arise, and to suggest
some possible answers.  The object of the exercise here is to be
exemplary rather than in any way exhaustive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already mentioned justification, and the interrelation of
theology and ethics (with its subset, the interrelation between
justification by faith and life in the Spirit).  These are not the major
questions that systematic theologians have struggled with throughout the
history of the church; indeed, Paul himself is capable of writing
letters in which one or both play little or no role.  But we cannot
imagine Paul writing a letter in which Jesus Christ played no part, or
in which the purpose and nature of the one true God were not under
consideration; and these are of course the central subject matter of
traditional Christian systematic theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, first, does Paul have to say in Galatians that will address the
traditional questions about God?  Such questions concern, for instance,
the identity and description of God, or a god; how knowledge of this god
is to be had (whether innate in humans, specially revealed, or
whatever); the relationship of this god to the world; the power and
operation of the god, not least his or her activity within the world;
what one can say about evil in the world, and what (if anything) this
god might be doing about it; the nature of human being and existence;
the question of appropriate human behavior.  Allowing Paul to address
these questions from his own angles, we can at once make the following
observations, which, though quite obvious, are not always highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the god of whom Paul speaks is without question the one God of
Israel, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  This God is the creator
of the world, and pagan idols are shams, or demons in disguise.  Even if
Paul sometimes seems to be saying that the God of Israel has behaved in
an unforeseen, perhaps an unpredictable, maybe even an unprincipled,
fashion, it is still the God of Israel he is talking about.  We should
expect Paul therefore to be on the map of first-century Jewish thought
about God &amp;mdash; and this is indeed the case, though not always in the ways
one might imagine.  When we glance across at the other Pauline letters,
and out into the rest of the NT, we find at this point a remarkable
unanimity.  Despite two millennia of Jewish protest to the contrary, the
NT writers, with Paul leading the way chronologically, firmly believe
themselves to be writing about, worshiping, and following the will of
the one God of Israel, and rejecting paganism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, in line with this, Paul believes that this God has a purpose for
the created world.  More specifically, he believes that &amp;ldquo;the present
evil age&amp;rdquo; will give way, in God&amp;rsquo;s good time, to &amp;ldquo;the age to come,&amp;rdquo; in
which Israel and the world will be redeemed from the power of the false
gods.  This apocalyptic belief was widespread in Paul&amp;rsquo;s Jewish world,
certainly in sectarian Judaism but also in groups that would not have
thought of themselves in that way.  This belief is not, or at least not
necessarily, &amp;ldquo;dualistic&amp;rdquo;; indeed, insofar as it envisages the present
world being set to rights rather than being abandoned, it emphasizes the
goodness and God-givenness of creation, while allowing fully, perhaps
too fully sometimes, for creation&amp;rsquo;s having been invaded, taken over,
distorted, and deceived by forces of evil and destruction.  Paul&amp;rsquo;s
understanding of God in Galatians includes the belief that the true God
has broken into the world, in the person of Jesus and the power of the
Spirit of Jesus, to usher in the long-awaited new age and so to redeem
Israel and the world (cf. esp. 1:4).  Here too Paul is in fundamental
agreement with the other NT writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, this God is revealed and known in the Jewish Scriptures, in
actions within history through which the scriptural promises are
fulfilled, and climactically in the coming of the Messiah.  The
apocalyptic intervention of God in Israel and the world, sweeping aside
all that stands in the way of the dawning new day, is paradoxically for
Paul the completion, the fulfillment, and the climax of all that God had
done and said to and for Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[8]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
The dense and difficult discussions of the Jewish law in Galatians owe
their very existence to the fact that Paul is unwilling to declare, as
many theologians since his day have done, that the Jewish law was shabby
or second-rate, or even demonic and dangerous.  He is determined to
insist, despite the problems he is storing up for later
readers, &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; that God gave the law and accomplished his purposes
through it &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that the Galatians must not submit to it, &lt;em&gt;since it was
given a specific role for a certain period of time that has now come to
an end&lt;/em&gt;.  Eschatology, not religious critique, is what counts.  To
dissolve the resultant paradox one way or another is a sure way of
misunderstanding Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes said that Galatians has a negative view of the law, and
Romans a positive one; it would be truer to say that in both letters
Paul wrestles mightily with this paradox, to address very different
situations and contexts.  It would be truer, thus, to find a deep
compatibility within the two that, when discovered, will reach out
further to embrace such other statements as 2 Corinthians 3 and
Philippians 3.  This eschatological reading of Paul&amp;rsquo;s understanding of
the Scriptures in general and the law in particular is the necessary
corrective to any idea that Paul is speaking in the abstract, either
about &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo; in general or about the Jewish law in a timeless way.  His
thought is controlled throughout by the sense of God&amp;rsquo;s purpose within
and beyond history, and of where he and his readers belong within that
story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this leads, of course, to the second area of major importance for
systematic theology to which Galatians might be supposed to make some
contribution.  What does Paul say about Jesus?  Merely collecting the
relevant isolated verses does not address the question.  We need to
discover what role Jesus plays within Paul&amp;rsquo;s ongoing &lt;em&gt;arguments&lt;/em&gt;.  As I
have urged elsewhere, the basic answer for Paul is that Jesus is the
Messiah of Israel, in whom the promises made to the patriarchs have
finally come
true.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[9]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
In particular, his death has solved the problem of evil that lay heavily
upon the world in general and, because of the warnings and curses of the
covenant, upon Israel in particular.  Though Paul mentions the death of
Jesus dozens of times in his writings, he never says exactly the same
thing twice (though the phrase &amp;ldquo;died for us&amp;rdquo; or something similar is a
regular refrain); he allows the specific needs of each argument to
determine what particular meaning he will draw out in each case. 
Underlying each of these, however, is Paul&amp;rsquo;s deeper meaning of
messiahship, visible in (for instance) Galatians 2:17-21: The Messiah
represents his people, so that what is true of him becomes true of
them.  His death becomes their death, and they find their new life
within his.  Underlying this, and I believe foundational for Paul&amp;rsquo;s
thinking about what we call &amp;ldquo;atonement&amp;rdquo; theology, is the belief that
what God does for Israel is done not for Israel only, but for the whole
world. Israel&amp;rsquo;s Messiah is the world&amp;rsquo;s Lord; the crucified, saving
Messiah who brings Jews out of their real exile is the crucified Lord
who by the same means rescues pagans from their bondage to nongods. 
This, I suggest, is the clue to that &amp;ldquo;incorporative&amp;rdquo; Christology that is
so frequently discussed, and of which 3:23-29 provides such a good,
though complex, example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hidden within the category of messiahship, in Paul&amp;rsquo;s construction of it,
is a deeper belief about Jesus which, so far as we know, was not held by
any non-Christian Jews in relation to any of the would-be Messiahs who
make their brief appearances in the tragic story of first-century
Judaism.  Drawing on the occasional but important biblical statements
about the Messiah being the adopted son of Israel&amp;rsquo;s God (e.g., Pss. 2:7;
89:27; 2 Sam. 7:14).  Paul describes Jesus as the unique son of God,
sent from God to effect the divine purpose &amp;mdash; i.e., the purpose that in
Scripture Israel&amp;rsquo;s God reserves to himself &amp;mdash; of redeeming his people
and thereby saving the whole world from destructive demonic powers. 
Thus, almost casually within this letter, written within at most
twenty-five years of Jesus&#39; crucifixion, we come upon what with
hindsight we may see as the first steps toward trinitarian language
(4:1-11).  The God whom Christians worship is the Jewish God, the God of
Abraham, of the exodus (exodus language, and the retelling of the exodus
story, permeate this context), and of Wisdom (the figure of &amp;ldquo;wisdom&amp;rdquo; is
of course in some Jewish texts &amp;mdash; e.g., Wis. 10:15-21 &amp;mdash; a way of
talking about the God of the exodus); but this God is now to be known as
the God who sends the Son. and who then sends the Spirit of his Son. 
And it is to this God alone that the Galatians must give full
allegiance; otherwise they will slide back to a state similar to what
they were in before.  You must either have the triune God, Paul is
saying, or you must have a form of paganism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This early form of proto-trinitarian theology thus appears &lt;em&gt;as a variant
within Jewish monotheism&lt;/em&gt;, not a form of crypto-paganism.  Exactly like
classic Jewish monotheism, it stands opposed both to paganism and to
dualism.  Just as Israel&amp;rsquo;s God made himself known as such in the exodus,
fulfilling the promises to Abraham and calling Israel his son, so this
same God has now revealed himself fully and finally in the new exodus of
Jesus&#39; death and resurrection, fulfilling the promises to Abraham in
their widest sense, challenging and defeating the pagan powers that had
kept humanity as a whole under lock and key.  To go back to allowing
one&amp;rsquo;s self-understanding, corporately or individually, to be determined
by ethnic boundary markers rather than by the new life given in the
Messiah is therefore to embrace again a form of paganism, however
paradoxical this may seem when what one thought one was doing was taking
on the yoke of the Jewish Torah.  A good case can be made for seeing
this critique underlying many of Paul&amp;rsquo;s other statements about the
Torah, not least in Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about God and Jesus in relation to Galatians has thus inevitably
embroiled us in talking about the plight of Israel and the world. Paul,
in this letter and everywhere else, takes it as axiomatic that all human
beings are under the power and rule of sin, and that the Jewish Torah,
so far from releasing people from this state, merely exacerbates it.  It
is quite wrong to say, as has often been done in recent scholarship,
that Paul&amp;rsquo;s thinking about Jesus preceded his thinking about the plight
from which people needed rescuing.  To be sure, the revelation of the
risen Jesus on the road to Damascus gave new shape and direction to his
thinking, on this and on everything else; but the pre-Damascus Paul was
well aware that there was a &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; to be addressed.  This was not,
perhaps, the problem of an unquiet conscience wished on him by
theologians from Augustine to Luther and beyond, but it was, certainly,
the problem of the pagan world under the power of evil, and the problem
that so much of the Jewish world seemed hell-bent on compromising with
paganism.  For himself as a zealous Pharisee, there was the very
specific problem that, even if he and some others were &amp;ldquo;blameless
concerning the law&amp;rdquo; (Phil. 3:6), Israel&amp;rsquo;s God had so far not acted
within their history to send the Messiah, to fight the decisive battle
against evil, to reveal his &amp;ldquo;righteousness&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; that is, his
faithfulness to the covenant promises with Israel, to redeem his people,
to judge the wicked world, and to set up the long-awaited kingdom of
justice and peace.  That was the problem the pre-Christian Paul
possessed.  His conversion deepened it, pointing at himself the accusing
finger that he would formerly have pointed at almost everyone else; but
it did not create a problem out of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution Paul embraced, which emerges clearly though briefly in
Galatians, to be elaborated in different situations in the other
letters, can be summed up in two closely related words: &amp;ldquo;Christ&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;Spirit.&amp;rdquo;  In Jesus the Messiah Israel&amp;rsquo;s God has dealt with sin and
established the new world, the &amp;ldquo;age to come,&amp;rdquo; calling the Gentiles to
belong to his renewed people.  Paul&amp;rsquo;s theology of the cross, which
receives repeated emphasis in Galatians, stresses both the solidarity of
Jesus with his people and the unique weight of sin and its effects which
were borne by Jesus himself.  Though, as we saw, Paul never articulates
a single &amp;ldquo;theology of atonement,&amp;rdquo; his many rich statements of Jesus&#39;
death, in this letter and throughout his works, together form a
many-sided doctrine that must be seen as central to his whole thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the many ways Paul can refer to this whole achievement of Jesus
is in terms of Jesus&#39; &amp;ldquo;faithfulness&amp;rdquo; to the covenant; this, I think, is
the correct interpretation of the much-controverted &lt;em&gt;pistis
Christou&lt;/em&gt; problem.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn10&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[10]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
As with so many issues, linguistic study by itself will not solve the
problem of whether, when Paul says &lt;em&gt;pistis Christou&lt;/em&gt;, he means
&amp;ldquo;faith &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the Messiah&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the faith(fullness) &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; the Messiah.&amp;rdquo; Both
ideas play a role in his thought.  In Galatians 2:16, after all, he does
say &amp;ldquo;we believed in the Messiah, Jesus,&amp;rdquo; and in Romans 5:15-19 the
&amp;ldquo;obedience&amp;rdquo; of Jesus the Messiah is the key category that sums up all
that Paul said about Jesus&#39; death in 3:21-26 (Phil. 2:5-8 confirms that
this is the correct interpretation).  Romans is, indeed, the key to
understanding the concept; in Romans 3:1-8 the problem that faces God,
as well as the whole human race, is that Israel has been &amp;ldquo;faithless&amp;rdquo; to
the commission to be the light of the world (cf. 2:17-24).  How then is
God to reveal his own covenant faithfulness?  Paul&amp;rsquo;s answer is that
God&amp;rsquo;s faithfulness is revealed in and through the faithfulness of Jesus
the Messiah, the representative Israelite.  Confusion arises not only
because this is not the train of thought readers of Romans in much
church tradition have been expecting &amp;mdash; it is too Jewish by half for
that &amp;mdash; but also because Paul also says, sometimes in the same breath,
as in Romans 3:22 and Galatians 2:16; 3:22, that the beneficiaries of
this covenant faithfulness of the Messiah are precisely those who in
their turn &amp;ldquo;believe&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;are faithful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, this God has called and is
calling Jews and Gentiles alike to belong to the one family of Abraham,
and equipping them to believe the gospel (such faith being the one
identifying badge of membership within this family) and to live in love
one to another and in witness to God&amp;rsquo;s love to the world around.  Like
the texts from Qumran, Paul&amp;rsquo;s letters articulate an inaugurated
eschatology in which the new age has already begun but is yet to be
completed.  &amp;ldquo;We by the spirit and by faith wait for the hope of
righteousness&amp;rdquo; (5:5).  The Spirit is the power of the new age breaking
into the present, but future hope remains vital for the complete
picture.  This, though briefly stated in Galatians, points toward wider
statements of the same theology elsewhere in Paul (e.g., 1 Cor. 15) and
indeed, though sometimes differently stated, in the rest of the NT.  For
Paul, of course, as most Christian theology has always insisted, the
Spirit is the same Spirit through whom God spoke and acted in the
history of Israel; the key difference in the new thing that has come
about through Jesus is that the Spirit is now poured out on all God&amp;rsquo;s
people, Jew and Gentile alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, Jesus, Spirit, plight, and solution: the final question the
systematic theologian might want to put to Galatians would be about
theology and ethics.  Here again the letter restates the question, and
answers it in its own way.  Earlier readings of Galatians, particularly
in the Reformation tradition, had so emphasized the wrongness of
&amp;ldquo;justification by works,&amp;rdquo; understanding that phrase in a Pelagian or
Arminian sense, as to make it difficult to articulate any sense of moral
obligation or moral effort within the Christian.  There are signs that
Paul faced similar problems (e.g., Rom. 3:7-8; 6:1,15), but this does
not seem to be why, in the final two chapters of Galatians, he provides
such a lengthy discourse on Christian behavior (the term &amp;ldquo;ethics&amp;rdquo; is
itself loaded, belonging already to the too-sharp distinction between
theory and practice of which I spoke earlier). Though he undoubtedly
wants his converts to avoid what he calls &amp;ldquo;the works of the flesh&amp;rdquo; and
to exhibit what he calls &amp;ldquo;the fruit of the Spirit,&amp;rdquo; the actual argument
in which those phrases and the things they denote occurs is more subtle
than simply exhortation.  It has various overtones and echoes of that
classic passage on the law, Romans 7, and may, like that passage, be
deliberately doing several things at the same time (see, e.g., Gal.
5:17: &amp;ldquo;spirit and flesh fight against each other, so that what you wish
you cannot do&amp;rdquo;).  It is an argument about the law, and about how, though
the law is God&amp;rsquo;s law, it cannot give the thing to which it points, and
about how, nevertheless, those who discover that to which it points are
in line with what the law intended, even though they may be neither
possessors nor, in its boundary-marking sense, keepers of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is saying, in effect, &amp;ldquo;If you insist on embracing the Jewish law, and
particularly on getting circumcised, you are declaring that you belong
in the realm of the &amp;lsquo;flesh&amp;rsquo;; but if you go and live in that realm, you
must look at the company you will be keeping, and the sort of life into
which you will be drawn.&amp;rdquo;  (The only sort of &amp;ldquo;fleshly&amp;rdquo; behavior he
thinks the Galatians are actually exhibiting is factional fighting, as
5:15,26 suggests; these angry divisions in their community, he is saying
in effect, are a sign that they are in fact living according to the
flesh, confirming the analysis he is offering of their desire to get
circumcised.)  The pagans who live in that fashion are heading for
destruction, but those who live and walk by the Spirit, whose first
fruit is love, find that although they are not behaving this way in
order to conform to the Jewish law, so that they may thereby be defined
as ethnically the people of God, they are not condemned by the law. 
&amp;ldquo;Against such there is no law&amp;rdquo; (5:23).  With this we are back once more
at 2:17.  Just because we have come out from under the rule of the Torah
through baptism and faith, through dying and rising with Christ, this
does not mean that the Torah (by which Paul presumably means the God who
gave the Torah) is displeased with us.  That Paul is working with this
same train of thought is indicated in 5:24: those who belong to the
Messiah have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires (compare
2:19-20; Rom 7:4-6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ethics,&amp;rdquo; then, understood as Paul&amp;rsquo;s arguments about Christian behavior.
function within Galatians not as an appendix to &amp;ldquo;theology,&amp;rdquo; nor simply
(as in Luther) as a &lt;em&gt;tertius usus
legis&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn11&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[11]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; nor
as an awkward concession after an antilegalistic &amp;ldquo;justification by
faith,&amp;rdquo; but rather as part of the inner working of the gospel itself. 
Through the gospel events of Jesus&#39; messianic death and resurrection,
the God of Israel delivers Israel and the world from the rule of evil
and the &amp;ldquo;powers&amp;rdquo; who perpetrate it.  Through the Spirit-inspired
proclamation of the good news of Jesus as Messiah and Lord, this same
God calls into being the redeemed family he had promised to Abraham,
whose distinguishing mark, over against those of Judaism, is &amp;ldquo;the
faithfulness of Jesus&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; i.e., Jesus&#39; own faithfulness, reflected now
in the faith/faithfulness (would Paul have distinguished these two?) of
Christians. Precisely because this family is the Christ-and-Spirit
people, they are set free from the destructive powers and solidarities
(including social solidarities) of evil, and are under the obligation of
freedom, namely, to sustain this life by Spirit-given love for one
another.  That they are free to do so is given in the fact that they
have been crucified with the Messiah (5:24; 6:14; 2:20).  This is Paul&amp;rsquo;s
answer in Galatians to the question of &amp;ldquo;ethics,&amp;rdquo; and it conforms well to
his other similar treatments elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Galatians, the Church, and the World&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then has Galatians to say to the large debates that concern
Christian theologians today, living often at the interface of church and
world?  Again, we can present some sample questions only, with some
tendentious possible answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that hangs over all contemporary intellectual discourse in
the Western world concerns the very foundations of all knowing and
being.  The great project of the last two or three hundred years,
sometimes known as &amp;ldquo;modernity,&amp;rdquo; has given way in many quarters to
&amp;ldquo;postmodernity.&amp;rdquo;  Modernism claimed to know things objectively, at least
in principle; postmodernism applies a ruthlessly suspicious
understanding to all such claims, showing in case after case that, as
Nietzsche argued a century ago, claims to knowledge are in fact claims
to power.  The correlate of this was that modernism claimed that there
was a real world independent of the knower.  Postmodernism collapses
this claim; all we are left with are the prejudices of the would-be
knower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, modernism told a great story of progress, enlightenment, and
development, and insisted that this story &amp;mdash; in which, of course, the
Western world of the eighteenth century and subsequently was the hero
&amp;mdash; be imposed on the rest of the world, in a secular version of the
Christian missionary enterprise that was burgeoning at exactly that
time.  Postmodernity declares that all such large stories &amp;mdash;
&amp;ldquo;metanarratives&amp;rdquo; is the word usually employed to denote the stories that
stand behind or above the smaller stories people tell and live &amp;mdash; are
destructive and enslaving, and must be deconstructed.  All we are left
with are the various smaller stories by which individual communities
order their lives, and even they are constantly under suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the individual himself or herself?  Modernity vaunted the
great individual, the lonely and lofty &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; the master of my fate,
the captain of my soul.  Postmodernity has deconstructed this figure,
too.  Each of us, we are now reminded, is a shifting mass of impulses
and feelings, without a stable center that can be held up and inspected.
Impressions to the contrary are just so much posturing.  These are the
main elements of postmodernity, which filter through into popular
consciousness in thousands of ways even among those who know nothing of
the technical terms of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a Christian theologian, with Galatians open before her or him,
address these questions? Galatians is. after all, concerned with truth
(2:5. 14; 4:16; 5:7); with claims and counterclaims to knowledge,
including knowledge of God (e.g., 4:8-9); with a great story that began
with Abraham, climaxed in Jesus the Messiah, and is moving outward to
embrace the world (3:6-4:11; etc.).  The most fundamental answer, I
believe, is that in Galatians Paul is concerned precisely with the
breaking of the bonds of slavery and the setting free of captives.  He
retells the exodus narrative, in 4:1-7 in particular, showing how in
Jesus the Messiah and by the Spirit those who were enslaved to nongods
have been liberated (4:8; cf. 1:4).  The story he tells certainly is a
grand overarching narrative, beginning with Israel and reaching out to
embrace the world, but it is a story that leaves no human being,
organization, or ethnic group in a position of power over others.  It is
the Jewish story, but it is not the typical Jew who says, &amp;ldquo;I am
crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives
in me.&amp;rdquo;  This is the story precisely of how those who were kept as
second-class citizens are now welcomed in on equal terms.  This is a
metanarrative like no other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same text (2:19-21) is Paul&amp;rsquo;s answer to those who would see the
individual deconstructed into various shifting forces and impulses. 
Paul goes further.  The individual, especially individuals who pride
themselves on their status, must die in order to live.  And the new life
they are given is not their own, is nothing to be proud of, is nothing
to give them status over others; it is the life of the crucified and
risen Messiah.  This is an individuality like no other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the result of the gospel is that those who are liberated from
slavery have come &amp;ldquo;to know God&amp;rdquo; (4:9) &amp;mdash; or rather, as Paul quickly
modifies it, to be known by God (cf. 1 Cor. 8:1-6).  Just as the
Israelites were granted a fresh revelation of the true God in the
exodus, so the events of the new exodus have truly revealed this same
God in a new way.  But the whole idea of &amp;ldquo;knowledge,&amp;rdquo; and with it of
truth itself, is hereby set on a new footing.  No longer is it the
brittle and arrogant knowledge of the post-Enlightenment world, making
the hard sciences its primary paradigm and &amp;ldquo;relationships&amp;rdquo; simply a
matter of &amp;ldquo;feeling.&amp;rdquo;  Nor is it the soft and fuzzy knowledge of the
postmodern world, where &amp;ldquo;feeling&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;impression&amp;rdquo; are all that there
is.  The primary knowledge, declares Paul, is the knowledge of God &amp;mdash;
God&amp;rsquo;s knowledge of you, and yours of God in grateful answer.  This is a
relationship, one that produces the deepest feelings ever known, but it
is true knowledge nonetheless &amp;mdash; both in that it is knowledge of the
truth and in that it constitutes the truest mode of knowing.  All other
knowing is first relativized and then, when and as appropriate,
reaffirmed in new ways from that point.  This is a knowing like no
other, because it is knowledge of a reality like no other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This account is, of course, so brief as to be no more than a signpost. 
But it makes the point that the issues Paul is addressing in Galatians
can provide us with starting points to address the major issues of our
own day. The opponents, after all, whoever they were, were seeking to
establish a way of being, a grand story, a form of knowing, a type of
identity, upon the converts.  The pressure to get circumcised was
precisely an insistence on establishing one kind of ethnic or
para-ethnic identity over against others.  Paul deconstructs these
claims, showing that they themselves are dehumanizing, based on &amp;ldquo;the
flesh.&amp;rdquo;  In particular, he shows &amp;mdash; a point that must be reemphasized
both in the clash between modernity and postmodernity and in the dawning
of a new millennium &amp;mdash; that the single moment by which history was
changed forever was the moment when Jesus the Messiah died and rose
again.  Modernity, postmodernity, and various sorts of millennial
speculation all offer their own counter-eschatology, but to take
Galatians seriously is to insist that the real turnaround, the real
moment of liberation, occurred not with some great cultural shift in the
Western world of the last few centuries, but when Jesus of Nazareth rose
from the dead, having &amp;ldquo;given himself for our sins&amp;rdquo; (1:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is fatally easy for Christians to embrace Paul&amp;rsquo;s gospel as
a new way of being in control of the world, a new power game, a new way
of establishing one&amp;rsquo;s identity as a matter of pride.  To what extent
this has happened and does happen in different churches and their claims
is a question that cannot be ignored.  But the key thing about Paul&amp;rsquo;s
gospel is not power, but love: the Son of God &amp;ldquo;loved me and gave himself
for me&amp;rdquo; (2:20); &amp;ldquo;faith working through love&amp;rdquo; is the sign of true life
(5:6); love is the first fruit of the divine Spirit, a love that leads
to mutual service (5:22,13).  Paul offers no encouragement to those who
want to go back to modernity.  He agrees with the postmodern critique of
all human pride; but when all is said and done, God is creating in
Christ a new world built on love and characterized by love. 
Postmodernity preaches a stern and judging law against all human pride,
but those who walk by the Spirit &amp;ldquo;are not under the law&amp;rdquo; (5:18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great crises in the contemporary world, which brings to a
head the sense of uncertainty within the formerly all-too-certain
Western world, is the situation of global security on the one hand and
long-running tribal or geographical conflict on the other.  A century
ago many in the West believed that war was a necessary part of human
development, leading through conflict at the societal level to the
survival of the fittest, on a loose analogy with Darwin&amp;rsquo;s theory of
evolution.  Two world wars and hundreds of smaller ones later, few
believe this anymore; and the &amp;ldquo;Cold War&amp;rdquo; that hung over the world for
nearly half a century reflected this growing uncertainty.  But the
modernist paradigm still remained in place, and when the West
effectively won the Cold War, a victory symbolized by the destruction of
the Berlin Wall, there was a widespread assumption that this would mean
the worldwide triumph of so-called &amp;ldquo;Western&amp;rdquo; values.  What has happened,
of course, is very different.  The Balkans, the Middle East, many
African countries, and many other parts of the world are a grim reminder
that hatred and violence based on tribe, race, and geography have not
disappeared overnight, and remain deep-rooted.  The world is full of
evidence for Paul&amp;rsquo;s warning: &amp;ldquo;If you bite and devour one another, take
care that you are not destroyed by each other&amp;rdquo; (5:15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will not do simply to say that into this world must be spoken the
gospel of Jesus Christ, the gospel Paul articulates and defends in
Galatians.  This is of course true, but what will it say to the Serb and
the Croat, to the Tutsi and the Hutu, to the Palestinian and the
Israeli?  Will it simply say, If only you would all believe in Jesus,
none of this would be necessary?  (If it did, it might find further
problems: the Serb and the Croat, the Catholic and Protestant in
Northern Ireland, all in theory believe in Jesus; and to modify the
statement to say &amp;ldquo;if only you would believe &lt;em&gt;in Jesus the same way I
do&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; would stand revealed as a new sort of tribalism.)  The most
powerful statement it can make must be made symbolically, through the
coming together in a single worshiping family, eating at the same table,
of all those who belong to Jesus the Messiah, despite their apparently
irreconcilable racial, tribal, or other tensions.  That is the powerful
message of Galatians 2:15-21.  That is a first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But second, the gospel as articulated in Galatians points to the hard
double-task described brilliantly in a recent book by Miroslav
Volf.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn12&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[12]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
Himself a Croatian, reflecting on the conflict in his native land, Volf
wrestles mightily with the gospel imperative toward forgiveness,
reconciliation, and inclusion, on the one hand, and the absolute need to
name and expose evil, and to deal with it, on the other.  One cannot
have the embrace of reconciliation without also having the exclusion of
evil.  The older liberal agendas that insisted only on the former, and
the tribal agendas that name as &amp;ldquo;evil&amp;rdquo; all that the other tribe does or
seeks to do, must be challenged by a larger vision, a harder agenda. 
And those who read Galatians must, I suggest, be in the forefront of
those presenting this agenda and vision to governments and policy
makers, often at a loss as they are to know where to turn for guidance
now that the old rules of modernity have let them down.  The church must
not only symbolize in its own life God&amp;rsquo;s victory over all the powers of
evil, the powers that keep peoples locked in their own separate stories,
fighting all others.  The church must present the world and its rulers
with ways of &amp;ldquo;excluding&amp;rdquo; that will lead to &amp;ldquo;embrace&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; just as Paul,
confronting Peter and the others at Antioch, and the opponents in
Galatia, named as clearly as he could the antigospel forces to which he
saw them succumbing, with the aim that all those who named the name of
Jesus should be able to share in the one family meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particular conflict in our world to which Galatians must be
addressed is, of course, that which disfigures to this day the land of
Jesus&#39; birth.  The story is so complex, presenting analysts with a huge
tangled ball of wool to unravel before a coherent solution can even be
thought of, that it is presumptuous, almost dangerous, even to raise the
question in a context like
this.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn13&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[13]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
Yet there are two points on which Galatians would insist, and which
could have a profound effect on the way people regard the situation and
act, individually and corporately, in relation to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the insistence, once again, that all Jesus&#39; followers
belong together in worship and table fellowship.  In the Middle East, at
the moment, it is sadly true that most indigenous Christianity seems to
be dying out.  The old monasteries, many of which have maintained
unbroken their traditions of worship for fifteen hundred years or more,
are almost empty, and many have been demolished by hostile
authorities.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn14&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[14]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
The small Palestinian Christian communities, which trace their roots
back to the first century and have lived in the land ever since, find
themselves caught between the self-righteous &amp;ldquo;settlers&amp;rdquo; on the one hand
&amp;mdash; Paul would, I think, have called them &amp;ldquo;unsettlers&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; and the
increasingly strident Islamic militants on the other.  Many have simply
left, and do not expect to return.  The tiny Israeli Christian
communities live, theoretically, in daily risk of losing their
citizenship for renouncing their Judaism.  There are reports of many
meeting in secret.  But there are few, very few, places where Israeli
and Palestinian Christians can meet and worship together and share in
trusting fellowship.  And the immigrant Christians &amp;mdash; the Protestant,
Catholic, and Orthodox, with their multiple subdivisions &amp;mdash; are no
better, but instead play similar territorial and other battles with one
another.  How can one even glance at Galatians and shrug one&amp;rsquo;s shoulders
at this situation?  Jesus is not Lord where churches divide along
ethnic, tribal, or geographical lines.  That was &amp;ldquo;the truth of the
gospel&amp;rdquo; for which Paul contended in the first century, and it remains
the truth of the gospel today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point is that, despite the extravagant claims of some, there
is no biblical warrant whatsoever for the suggestion that the
reestablishment of the state of Israel in the 1940s constituted the
fulfillment of biblical prophecy and that, as such, it should be
supported by right-thinking Christians.  Galatians is one of the
biblical books that most strongly gives the lie to this.  Paul is at
pains throughout to distance himself from any geographical or
territorial claim; these things are done away with in Christ.  &amp;ldquo;The
present Jerusalem is in bondage with her children; but the Jerusalem
that is above is free, and she is the mother of us all&amp;rdquo; (4:25-26).  Nor
is this a mere assertion.  Paul&amp;rsquo;s whole argument is that &amp;ldquo;the Israel of
God&amp;rdquo; (6:16) consists of all those, Jew and Gentile alike, who believe in
Jesus the
Messiah.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn15&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[15]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
&amp;ldquo;If you belong to the Messiah, you are Abraham&amp;rsquo;s seed, heirs according
to the promise.&amp;rdquo;  How then can the &amp;ldquo;inheritance&amp;rdquo; of the &amp;ldquo;heirs&amp;rdquo; be
translated back into terms of a few square miles of sacred land, kept
for the descendants of Abraham &amp;ldquo;according to the
flesh&amp;rdquo;?&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn16&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[16]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest question, of course, which hangs over all Christian
thinking and speaking in our day, and which poses an equal challenge to
systematic and practical theology, is: How can we speak truly and
appropriately of God within a world that has forgotten most of what it
thought it knew about God and has distorted much of the rest?  And what
weight, what &amp;ldquo;authority,&amp;rdquo; can such speaking command?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may remind ourselves of the problem.  Most people rooted in
contemporary Western culture assume, unless they have been specifically
shaken out of this way of thinking, that the word &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; refers, more or
less univocally, to a being who is detached from the world, living at
some great ontological remove (most know that Christians and others do
not believe in God as a being literally &amp;ldquo;up in the sky,&amp;rdquo; but most assume
a similar detachment in some other mode of being).  They then tend to
assume that when Christians talk about God becoming human in Jesus,
about God addressing individuals or the world, or about God active
within the world, this must be a matter of God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;intervening&amp;rdquo; from a
distance.  They assume, moreover, that all religions are basically
trying to be about the same thing; this idea is frequently supposed to
be a very recent innovation or discovery, but was of course the common
coin of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and indeed has roots much
further back in some aspects of classical paganism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they assume that this general thing &amp;mdash; which may as well be called
&amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; for want of a better term, though that word is so over- and
ill-used that one wonders if a moratorium would not be a good idea &amp;mdash;
has basically failed. It has collapsed, so it is thought by those who
think about these things, under the critique of Marx, who said that
talking about God was what those in power did to keep the rest quiet; of
Darwin, who said that we were all descended from the apes anyway, and
that the world could be understood successfully without a creating or
sustaining God, since it works on the basis of competition; of Freud,
who said that God-language was projection of a latent father image; and
of Nietzsche, who despised Christianity for being wet and wimpish while
also exposing its truth claims as power games.  Of course, as C. S.
Lewis used to say, if people really &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; about these things, it
might become clear that the attacks, though sometimes interesting and
important, are not ultimately valid.  But most people in western Europe,
and many in North America, do not think very hard about such issues. 
They assume, not least because the media tell them so, that &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; and
&amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; are somehow out of date.  Within the postmodern world it is
feelings that count, not arguments; and there is a general feeling,
widespread in much (though not all) Western culture, that all that sort
of thing has had its day &amp;mdash; certainly in any form that the culture has
known for the last several hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not the only side of the story.  New Age movements
have brought &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; of a sort back into fashion; and the oldest form
of Christianity in Britain at least, that of the Celts, who evangelized
much of Britain before the Romans arrived and effectively took over, has
had a revival as well.  Celtic Christianity was earthier, less
authoritarian, more in tune with the created order than the Roman
variety, and this has made its appeal powerful.  But at a time when
hardly anybody thinks about the niceties of theology (they are prepared
to think about nuclear physics, about economics, about anything the
media bombard them with, but not usually about theology), it is
difficult for many to sort out the difference between the God-language
of the New Age movement and the God-language of mainstream Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The God of whom Paul speaks in Galatians, of whom I have already written
at the start of the previous section, is not a private God, to be
worshiped by initiates but kept secret from the outside world.  This God
must be spoken of in the public arena.  This God claims the allegiance
of all, because this God is both creator and lover of all.  This God is
the reality of which the idols of the world are the parodies (4:8-11). 
But how can one speak of this God without being instantly
misunderstood?  If one uses the word &amp;ldquo;God,&amp;rdquo; people will suppose one is
speaking of the detached, deist God of popular supposition.  If one even
pronounces the name and title &amp;ldquo;Jesus Christ,&amp;rdquo; one will at once send half
one&amp;rsquo;s hearers off down the wrong street.  Among those to whom the phrase
is not simply a meaningless swearword, many will simply hear it as
another signal of that &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; which is assumed to be out of date and
irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, we know from Acts, faced similar problems, and he got around them
by telling the story of Jesus, perhaps with visual aids to show what he
was talking about (&amp;ldquo;You before whose eyes Jesus the Messiah was publicly
portrayed as crucified&amp;rdquo; [3:1]; did Paul draw one of the first-ever
&amp;ldquo;crucifixes&amp;rdquo; as an aid to
evangelism?).&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn17&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[17]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
The story itself, climaxing with Jesus&#39; death and resurrection, and his
enthronement as Lord of the world, carries its own power (Rom. 1:17; 1
Cor. 1:18-2:5).  The story must be told faithfully, accurately, and
Jewishly (it only makes the sense it does in its Jewish
context).&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn18&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[18]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
However, even this needs a hearing. Paul seems to have obtained his not
least because of his original appearance in Galatia, which aroused their
sympathy and showed them that he was already living by a different way
when compared to other teachers and wandering philosophers they might
have
met.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[19]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
Paul was &lt;em&gt;embodying&lt;/em&gt; the message he was announcing.  The story of Jesus
was being recapitulated through his own actual life &amp;mdash; which was why,
Paul would quickly have said, the power of the Spirit of Jesus was at
work when he told them of the Jewish Messiah, the Lord of the world.  If
there is a lesson for Christians today in all this, it is the one that
is both obvious and also still sorely needed.  Those who name the name
of Jesus must be seen to be living the life that results from worshiping
the true God.  Their own genuine humanity, resulting from worshiping the
God in whose image they are made, must be recognizable.  The fruits of
the Spirit, when we meet them, are impressive, particularly in our
cynical age.  If we are to get a hearing to tell the story of Jesus,
this is the only way to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is more.  The church must be active at the places where the
world is in pain.  The church must be in the forefront of work in the
world to alleviate hunger and poverty, to remit major and unpayable
international debt, to make peace and prevent war.  The church must be
on the front line in the fight against crime and the fight for proper
punishment and rehabilitation of those convicted of crime, as well as
for the rights of the victims of crime.  Christians must be active not
only in advocacy of the moral standards in which all are treated as full
human beings, not as toys or as trash, but also to stand alongside and
help those who, having been treated like that themselves, treat others
the same way because that is the only way they know.  In these and many,
many other ways, those who would tell the story of Jesus must first live
it, bearing a measure of the world&amp;rsquo;s pain as they do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process, though the words of the story remain important and
ultimately nonnegotiable, the actions themselves will speak.  They will
provide, as it were, the grammar book and the dictionary that will
enable people to understand that when we speak of God today we are not
using the word in the normally accepted sense; that when we speak of
Jesus we speak of a real human being in whom the living God was and is
personally present, in whom the love of God was fully acted out.  If the
story is told with those lexical aids to back it up, it will be
understood.  People may not like it, but the message will be plain. And
to those who respond, the challenge will come to continue with this God:
&amp;ldquo;Then, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to beings that by
nature are not gods.  But now that you know God, or rather have come to
be known by God, how can you turn back?&amp;rdquo; (4:8-9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Galatians: Exegesis and Theology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have now arrived back at the point where the detailed historical
exegesis of Galatians and the wider theological reflections may, in some
measure and very briefly, be joined together.  My overall contention, as
will by now be obvious, is that they belong closely with each other,
need each other, and are mutually illuminating.  It will take an entire
commentary to demonstrate this point, but four major features may at
least be outlined in conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let me raise a point of method. Galatians offers itself to the
reader as a text emerging from, referring constantly to, and intending
to have serious effect upon a highly complex and many-sided social
situation.  At no point can we abstract Paul&amp;rsquo;s ideas from this setting;
and this, within an incarnational religion such as Christianity, has
almost always been and is undoubtedly a strength, not a weakness.  To
suppose that one must boil off doctrinal abstractions from the
particularities of the letters in order to gain material that can be
usable in different situations is at best a half-truth; it always runs
the risk of implying that the &amp;ldquo;ideas&amp;rdquo; are the reality, and that the
community in which they are embodied and embedded (Paul&amp;rsquo;s community on
the one hand, ours on the other) is a secondary matter.  Those who, like
the present writer, work as theologians within actual ecclesial
communities for which they have pastoral, organizational, and teaching
responsibilities know otherwise.  It is in taking seriously Paul&amp;rsquo;s
struggles with authority, with other apostles, with agitators in a
congregation, with division and reconciliation within a community, that
we discover what the &amp;ldquo;doctrines&amp;rdquo; he seems to hold actually mean.  This
in no way reduces theology to sociology.  Nor does it suggest that
theological argument is shadowboxing, pretending to reason something out
when what is going on is in fact disguised power play.  It is a way of
doing justice to Paul&amp;rsquo;s intention not least, but not only, in the first
two chapters of Galatians: to enable his readers to understand what the
gospel is, what his own relation to it is, and where they, his converts,
belong on this map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This intention, second, is expressed in Paul&amp;rsquo;s major concern throughout
the letter but particularly in its central two chapters, 3 and 4.  Here
he tells the story of Israel, the people of God, as the story of Abraham
and exodus.  God made promises to Abraham, promises that (as in Gen. 15,
to which, here and in Rom. 4, Paul refers repeatedly) envisaged God&amp;rsquo;s
future rescue of his people from Egypt.  God has now fulfilled those
promises, Paul says, in Jesus Christ.  His aim throughout is to persuade
his hearers to understand themselves within this narrative structure,
which I have elsewhere characterized as &amp;ldquo;covenantal.&amp;rdquo;  He wants them,
that is, to think of themselves as the children of Abraham, the heirs of
the entire Jewish
narrative.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn20&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[20]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
A good example is 1 Corinthians 10:1-13, written of course to an
ex-pagan congregation; the foundation of the argument is Paul&amp;rsquo;s
reference to the wilderness generation as &amp;ldquo;our fathers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His deep-rooted negation of the Jewish Torah as the mode or badge of
membership in this family is, of course, the central problem he faces,
and hence the central problem of the letter; this rejection of the
Mosaic covenant has influenced many contemporary writers to deny that
Paul held any &amp;ldquo;covenantal&amp;rdquo; theology at
all.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn21&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[21]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
This, I am persuaded, is a radical mistake.  Paul utterly discarded the
ethnic and Torah-based shape of Judaism in which he had been so deeply
involved before his conversion, and to this extent his theology is
radical, apocalyptic, innovative, dialectic, and so forth.  But all this
is held within his conviction that the God whom he now knows in Jesus
Christ and the Spirit is the God of Abraham, whose purposes have now
taken a decisive turn in which the character of the community as defined
by Torah is left behind (not, it should be noted, criticized as
theologically repugnant).  He tells the story of Abraham, Israel, Moses,
Jesus, and himself&amp;mdash;Paul himself becomes a character in the narrative,
since he is the unique apostle to the Gentiles, a point that is
foundational for Galatians&amp;mdash;in order to help his readers understand
where they in turn belong within the same narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the letter indicates this as a very basic aim of Paul all
through, I am persuaded that he has not simply introduced Abraham, and
allusions to other biblical passages and stories, in order to meet
points raised by his opponents.  Indeed, even if his opponents had never
mentioned Abraham, perhaps especially if they had not, Paul would have
wanted to tell this story to address and controvert the point the
agitators were urging, that Gentiles who wanted to join the people of
Israel had to be circumcised.  His way of telling the story of Abraham
makes it abundantly clear that the promises God made to the patriarch
cannot be fulfilled through Torah. According to Galatians 3:10-14, God
promised Abraham a worldwide family, but the Torah presents Israel, the
promise bearers, with a curse.  God deals with the curse in the death of
Jesus, so that the promise may flow through to the world, renewing the
covenant with Israel as well.  According to 3:15-22, God promised
Abraham a single worldwide family, but the Torah would forever keep Jews
and Gentiles in separate compartments (exactly the problem of 2:11-21
and, we may assume, of the Galatian congregations).  God has done in
Christ and by the Spirit what the Torah could not do (3:21-22; 4:1-7;
cf. Rom. 8:3-4), so that there now exists the single promised
multiethnic monotheistic family, God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;sons&amp;rdquo; and
heirs.&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Galatians_Exegesis_Theology.htm#_edn22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[[22]]{.ul}&lt;/a&gt; 
According to Galatians 4:21-31, insofar as Abraham has two families,
they can be characterized as the slave family and the free; and it is
the multiethnic people defined by faith, the people formed through
Christ and the Spirit, who are the Isaac children, the free people of
God.  Paul has other ways of telling the story of Abraham and his family
as well (e.g., Rom. 9:6-10:4), but it is this narrative, however
articulated, that provides the theological grounding for the formation
and maintenance of the community he believes himself called to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we can now see that the regular theological dichotomies that have
been used in debates about Paul for the last hundred years are in fact
inadequate to the task.  Schweitzer and Wrede insisted on &amp;ldquo;being in
Christ&amp;rdquo; as a more central category than &amp;ldquo;justification by faith.&amp;rdquo; 
Sanders, similarly, prioritized &amp;ldquo;participationist&amp;rdquo; categories in Paul
over &amp;ldquo;juristic&amp;rdquo; ones.  More recently, Martyn and others have urged
&amp;ldquo;apocalyptic&amp;rdquo; readings of Paul against &amp;ldquo;covenantal&amp;rdquo; ones.  Granted that
these broad-brush categories are imprecise, there is clearly a strong
feeling among Western readers of Paul that one is faced again and again
with different kinds of emphases, which may not always be strictly
compatible.  This works out in Romans, for instance, in terms of the
playing off of one of its clear sections (chaps. 1-4, 5-8, 9-11, 12-16)
against the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe, and I hope that detailed exegesis will support this
hypothesis, that in each case these dichotomies have failed to grasp the
more fundamental structures of Paul&amp;rsquo;s socially contextualized and
literarily structured theological thought.  Once we grasp the covenantal
narrative that Paul sets out in Galatians as the world he invites his
readers to inhabit, we discover that these elements &amp;mdash; which appear
disparate when seen from a post-Reformation, post-Enlightenment, or
postromantic viewpoint &amp;mdash; belong together within the much richer
tapestry he is weaving.  The story of the new exodus in Christ, and the
homeward journey of God&amp;rsquo;s people led by the Spirit, provides the setting
for incorporative and participationist language to have its full meaning
and weight simultaneously with the juristic meaning of justification. 
Because of sin, and the distortion of Torah by the people to whom it was
given, the fulfillment of the covenant cannot but come about as an
apocalyptic event, declaring God&amp;rsquo;s judgment on what has gone before and
God&amp;rsquo;s new creation of what is now beginning.  But when the dust settles
and God&amp;rsquo;s renewed people look around them, they discover that this
apocalyptic event is indeed the fulfillment of God&amp;rsquo;s promises to
Abraham.  This is how God is faithful to the covenant.  It will take all
of the letter to the Romans to set this out in full detail and most of
the rest of the NT to explore the point from a variety of other angles,
but the major components of the argument are already complete in
Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, fourthly and finally, about justification by faith?  This is the
subject that most expositors of Galatians have found to be central to
the argument of the letter itself.  But what is it actually about? 
There is no space here for a full exposition of the doctrine. Rather, I
wish to pose the question thus: What particular emphases does Galatians,
read historically and exegetically, provide in this central matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first point we have already noted. Paul&amp;rsquo;s initial introduction of
the topic is embedded within, and seems to be the sharp edge of, the
question that was at issue between himself and Peter in Antioch and, we
may assume, bears some close relation to the dispute between himself and
the &amp;ldquo;agitators&amp;rdquo; in Galatia.  This was not the general, abstract
theological issue of, shall we say, how to go to heaven when one dies. 
It was not part of a theory of soteriology, understood in this way.  It
was the question of whether Christian Jews ought or ought not eat with
Christian Gentiles.  In other words, it addressed the question of
the &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;demarcation&lt;/em&gt; of the people of God, now redefined in
Jesus Christ &amp;mdash; a question that is both sociological, in the sense that
it has to do with a community and its behavior, which can itself be
understood by the proper application of sociological methods, and
theological, in the sense that this community believes itself to be the
people of a God who has drawn up quite clear conditions precisely for
its communal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul&amp;rsquo;s answer to the question is complex and dense, but its heart is
simple.  Because he, and all Jewish Christians, have &amp;ldquo;died to the law&amp;rdquo;
through sharing the messianic death of Jesus, their identity now is not
defined by or in terms of the Jewish law, but rather in terms of the
risen life of the Messiah.  The boundary marker of this messianic
community is therefore not the set of observances that mark out Jews
from Gentiles, but rather Jesus the Messiah, the faithful one, himself;
and the way in which one is known as a member of this messianic
community is thus neither more nor less than (Christian) faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this account (Gal. 2:15-21) is not itself about soteriology per
se, it carries, of course, huge soteriological implications.  If one has
already died and risen with the Messiah, and if one has been grasped by
the grace of God and enabled to come to faith and (by implication,
brought into daylight in) baptism (3:26-28), then one is marked out
thereby precisely as a member of the renewed, eschatological community
of Israel, one for whom the act of God in the Messiah has dealt finally
with one&amp;rsquo;s sinful past, one who is assured of God&amp;rsquo;s salvation on the
Last Day.  But the point of justification by faith, in this context, is
not to stress this soteriological aspect, but to insist that all those
who share this Christian faith are members of the same single family of
God in Christ &lt;em&gt;and therefore belong at the same table&lt;/em&gt;.  This is the
definite, positive, and of course deeply polemical thrust of the
first-ever exposition of the Christian doctrine of justification by
faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already provided a summary account of Galatians 3 and 4, seen as
a narrative, or part of a larger implicit narrative, about the promises
of God to Abraham and the way in which these are fulfilled in Jesus the
Messiah. It remains here simply to note the way in which justification
emerges within this structure of thought, which itself is grounded in
Paul&amp;rsquo;s sense of the community he is addressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His emphasis throughout is that the true people whom God promised to
Abraham are defined by their faith.  He is not here concerned with how
one enters the family, but with how, once one has entered, the family is
then defined, assured of its status as God&amp;rsquo;s people.  The arguments in
chapter 3 about the curse of the law, and how it is exhausted in the
death of Jesus, and about the apparent tension between the promise and
the law, are not primarily abstract statements about the atonement on
the one hand and about the existential or spiritual superiority or
preferability of trusting promises rather than keeping moral codes on
the other.  No doubt they contribute to discussions at these more
abstract levels, but such matters were not what Paul was basically
talking about.  And in the great climactic passage at the end of chapter
3 and the start of chapter 4, the question of justification is set
within the narrative about slavery and sonship &amp;mdash; that is, the exodus
story, in which the key interlocking categories for the present status
of Christians are incorporation into Christ and the indwelling of the
Spirit.  These are not &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; something other than justification.
Rather, justification by faith itself, in the letter to Galatia, is all
about the definition of the community of the people of the true God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, a puzzling conclusion for those who have learned the
word &amp;ldquo;justification&amp;rdquo; as a technical term for the way in which someone
becomes a Christian.  But it is noticeable that when Paul discusses that
question (e.g., 1 Thess. 1), he does not use the language of
justification.  He talks about the way in which, through the gospel
proclamation of the crucified and risen Jesus as Messiah and Lord of the
world, God&amp;rsquo;s Spirit is at work to bring people to faith, a faith
specifically in the God now known in this Jesus.  &lt;em&gt;This process, though,
is not what Paul means by &amp;ldquo;justification.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  Justification, to offer a
fuller statement, is the recognition and declaration by God that those
who are thus called and believing are in fact his people, the single
family promised to Abraham, that as the new covenant people their sins
are forgiven, and that since they have already died and been raised with
the Messiah they are assured of final bodily resurrection at the last. 
This, of course, is the argument of (among other passages) Romans 5-8,
and in a measure also Philippians 3.  In Galatians it is hinted at but
never spelled out, for the good reason that Paul&amp;rsquo;s eye is on one thing
principally &amp;mdash; namely, the unity of the single Jew-plus-Gentile family
in Christ and the consequent impossibility of that family being in
anyway defined by the Jewish Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully to grasp this, I realize only too well, will demand of those who
wish to be in tune with Paul, on the one hand, and to continue to preach
the gospel and thereby to evoke and sustain Christian faith, on the
other, that they think through afresh the language they use, the
passages upon which they draw to make their point, and the detailed
theology they are presupposing.  But I am quite convinced that this
essentially &amp;ldquo;new-look&amp;rdquo; reading of justification in Galatians does not
undermine the traditional theology and spirituality that former
generations, and other ways of reading Paul, have for so long built upon
this text.  Indeed, when the bricks of the house are taken down,
cleaned, and reassembled in the right order, there is every hope that
the building will be more serviceable and weather-proof than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course many other issues that cry out to be discussed.  I
have said very little, for example, about the Spirit in Galatians, and
the relation of what Paul says on this topic to other NT evidence.  But
I hope to have shown that the task of bringing together exegesis and
theology is valid and fruitful, if demanding, and that a commentary
series that attempts such a task has every chance of providing fresh
stimulation and insight to a new generation for whom neither dry
historical exegesis nor flights of theological fancy will do by
themselves.  Galatians is a wonderful example of a text that needs
history and theology to be working at full stretch and in full harmony. 
But there is every reason to suppose that the rest of the NT will
respond excellently to the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts from Luke</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/thoughts-from-luke/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/thoughts-from-luke/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-baptism&#34;&gt;Jesus Baptism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When all the people were being baptised, Jesus was baptised too. And as
he was praying, heaven was opened&amp;rdquo; (Lk 3:21 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus went under the waters bearing the sins of the world. His baptism
anticipated the cross, which he also referred to as a baptism and
associates with Jonah&amp;rsquo;s baptism in the sea (Jonah 1:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know what you are asking,&amp;rdquo; Jesus said. &amp;ldquo;Can you drink the cup
I drink or be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with?&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; (Mk 10:38
NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;temptation&#34;&gt;Temptation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we attempt to use our human powers to establish God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom
or allow faith to become the servant of human power we have succumbed to
the third temptation &amp;ldquo;All these I will give if you bow to me...&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Jesus&#39; trial the crowd had to choose Jesus of Nazareth whose kingdom
was not of this world, or Jesus Barabbas, a human messianic
rebel-fighter. They chose the fighter. Even Peter wanted to choose to
fight rather than suffer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jesus turned and said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;Get behind me, Satan! You are a
stumbling-block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but
the things of men.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; (Mt 16:23 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people were anticipating a Messiah who would bring peace and
prosperity for Israel, if not for the whole world. In the absence of
this most Jews and Gentiles alike have rejected the claims of Christ.
But what He brought was God Himself. Now we know His face and can call
upon Him. We know the path we have to follow. We know our origin and our
destiny. It is only because of our hardness of hearts that we think this
too little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gospel-of-the-kingdom&#34;&gt;The Gospel of the Kingdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus knew that behind a seemingly positive response was often a heart
of stone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.
But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all
people. He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what
was in each person.&amp;rdquo; (Jn 2:24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Why do you follow Jesus? What makes you decide to be obedient to him
rather than go your own way? What makes you be disobedient? What do you
feel like after you have taken a big step of faith?  What do you feel
like after you have been disobedient? &lt;br&gt;
In all of these situations what matters is your relationship with God.&lt;br&gt;
Lk5:12-14 the most despised people had great faith in Jesus power to
heal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus sent the leper to the priest at the temple which presented him
with powerful evidence that mighty works were being performed by Jesus.
This brought Pharisees and other leaders from all over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu15 celebrations because sinners are repenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said three seemingly contradictory things about the Kingdom of
God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kingdom has come here and now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lk 11:20 the kingdom of God has come to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My kingdom is not of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jn 18:36 &amp;ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world ... But my kingdom is from
another place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king is yet to come&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt 24:30 &amp;ldquo;At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the
sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son
of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in
order to observe your own traditions!&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Mark 7:9&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are often blind to our own traditions and jump to defend them when
challenged. Let&amp;rsquo;s try asking a few questions about our common church
practices and see what emerges. Let us imagine the process for a person
coming to faith and becoming part of the church&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;presenting-the-gospel&#34;&gt;Presenting the Gospel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been taught to share the &lt;em&gt;Gospel of Christ&lt;/em&gt; by explaining how
sin has separated us from God and how Jesus paid our penalty by His
death on the cross. We need to confess our sins and ask for forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astonishing fact is that more than 90% of people who &amp;ldquo;respond&amp;rdquo; to
this version of the gospel do &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; go on to become disciples of
Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gospel of the Kingdom, not the Gospel of Christ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform
healing. &lt;strong&gt;Luke 9:2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of the Kingdom has mostly been replaced in our evangelism and
preaching with the Gospel of Christ. In other words, instead of talking
about the good news concerning the Kingdom of God, we talk about the
good news of Jesus dying for our sins on the cross. Yet even after the
cross, the apostles continued to preach the &lt;em&gt;Gospel of the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; and
the truth about Christ - even to the Gentiles, who did not have any
expectation or understanding of the Jewish concept of God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;God&amp;rsquo;s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!&amp;rdquo;
For two whole years Paul stayed there ... He proclaimed the &lt;strong&gt;kingdom
of God&lt;/strong&gt; and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ! &lt;strong&gt;Act 28:28&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-starting-point-for-the-gospel&#34;&gt;The starting-point for the Gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus instructed that the preaching of the Gospel should start with
healing. The apostles and Paul continued to make healing the
starting-point for presenting the Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus instructed the 70 how to share the Gospel he said, &amp;ldquo;Heal the
sick who are there and tell them, &amp;lsquo;The kingdom of God is near you.&#39;&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Luke 10:9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When describing His own ministry He said, &amp;ldquo;I will keep on driving out
demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I
will reach my goal.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Luke 13:32&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Peter describes Jesus&amp;rsquo; ministry he says &amp;ldquo;God anointed Jesus of
Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good
and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Ac 10:38&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Paul described his ministry he said, &amp;ldquo;My message and my preaching
were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the
Spirit&amp;rsquo;s power, so that your faith might not rest on men&amp;rsquo;s wisdom, but
on God&amp;rsquo;s power.&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but
of power.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;1Co 2:4-5, 1Co 4:20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having demonstrated God&amp;rsquo;s presence and power with healing and
deliverance from demons, the message preached was also about deliverance
&amp;ndash; deliverance from the kingdom of darkness into God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom of Light.
That is why it was called the Gospel of the Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus announced His mission He said &amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on
me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has
sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for
the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s
favour.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Lk 4:18-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of the Kingdom is good news to the poor and oppressed. It
does not require explanation as to why it is good news. But the
self-righteous and self-sufficient will not realise their need. Yet many
who are outwardly prosperous are oppressed by inner torment. The Gospel
of the Kingdom is not about going to heaven when we die, but being set
free to live in God&amp;rsquo;s good Kingdom now. It is a gospel of entering into
God&amp;rsquo;s Goodness now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repentance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and
believe in the gospel.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Mark 1:15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repentance called for in the Gospel of the Kingdom is focused on
turning from the kingdom of Darkness to the Kingdom of Light. It is
repentance from our rebellion and independence from God. It is about the
whole direction and focus of our lives. It is not really about the
individual sins that we might be able to recount &amp;ndash; such a focus
encourages a focus on our past and future performance, rather than the
underlying motivations in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never read of Jesus asking anyone to confess and repent of their
sins; He simply announces forgiveness as part of the Kingdom message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demonstration, not just explanation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clear emphasis of the Gospel Jesus has commanded us to preach is one
of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;delivering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; people from the power of Satan and healing them. The
Gospel Jesus commanded us to preach is not an &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; but a
&lt;em&gt;demonstration&lt;/em&gt; of the God who sets us free. Fear and powerlessness has
driven us to abandon the demonstration and rely upon explanation. The
rise of individualism has led us to abandon the Gospel of the Kingdom
and adopt an emasculated individualistic gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-response-to-the-gospel&#34;&gt;The response to the gospel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition-1&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been taught that the proper response to hearing the gospel is to
pray the sinner&amp;rsquo;s prayer: asking for God&amp;rsquo;s forgiveness and inviting Him
into their life as Lord and Saviour. We have been taught that when a
person prays this prayer, they are born again and belong to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command-1&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus taught that the proper response to the Gospel is &lt;em&gt;immediate&lt;/em&gt;
baptism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Nicodemus asked how he could be saved, Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;Very truly I
tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of
water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy Spirit).&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;John
3:5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter taught the same: &amp;ldquo;Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the
name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 2:38&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who accepted his message were baptized, &lt;strong&gt;Acts 2:41&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Philip had told him the good news about Jesus, the Ethiopian
eunuch said, &amp;ldquo;Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being
baptized?&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 8:35-36&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ananias said to Paul on his conversion, &amp;ldquo;And now what are you waiting
for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Acts 22:16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philippian gaoler asked, &amp;ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&amp;rdquo; The
response was &amp;ldquo;immediately he and all his household were baptized.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Acts 16:29-33&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person who wants to become a Christian does not say &amp;ldquo;I want to be
baptised&amp;rdquo; then we have not shared the Gospel as Jesus commanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;baptism&#34;&gt;Baptism&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition-2&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been taught that salvation is by faith alone, and not by any act
or merit on our part. We have been taught that baptism is a &lt;em&gt;symbol&lt;/em&gt; of
sharing in Jesus&#39; death on the cross and rising again with Him in His
resurrection. We have been taught that baptism must be undertaken
seriously and after proper instruction, so that a person properly
understands what they are doing. We have been taught that Baptism is a
public declaration of our commitment to follow Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command-2&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although salvation is occasionally described without mention of baptism,
the overwhelming evidence of the NT is that baptism was considered to be
an integral and necessary act in a person&amp;rsquo;s salvation. To separate
baptism from salvation is something that the Bible does not permit us to
do. No one who wishes to be obedient to Jesus can excuse themselves from
baptism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the NT presents baptism as the &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; of entering the Kingdom of
God, it is never separated from conversion, as a separate event. The
notion that someone can be saved, and then instructed in preparation for
baptism, is totally absent. If preparation classes are deemed necessary,
they should be re-classified as salvation classes, not baptism classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere does the NT teach that baptism should be a public event. On the
contrary, both the Philippian gaoler&amp;rsquo;s family and the Ethiopian eunuch
had private baptisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Jesus nor any New Testament writer ever says that baptism is a
symbol. It is always presented as the &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; by which a person enters
the Kingdom of God. The death of Jesus on the cross and His resurrection
from the dead is what &lt;em&gt;Jesus&lt;/em&gt; did so that we could be saved, but what
&lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; must do is be baptised in water and the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless
they are born of water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy
Spirit).&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;John 3:5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved. &lt;strong&gt;Mark 16:16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, salvation is by faith alone, but faith is expressed by obedience,
and Jesus commanded baptism in water and the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the waters of the Flood, Peter says, &amp;ldquo;this water
symbolizes baptism that now saves you also&amp;mdash;not the removal of dirt
from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves
you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 3:21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter doesn&amp;rsquo;t say that baptism symbolises our death and resurrection
with Jesus, but that the flood symbolises baptism. Baptism is the real
thing, and Peter twice says that &amp;ldquo;baptism saves you&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through baptism we are forgiven for our sins and set free from the
control of our old nature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ
for the forgiveness of your sins.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 2:38&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your whole self, ruled by the flesh was put off when you were
circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in
which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working
of God, who raised him from the dead. &lt;strong&gt;Col 2:11-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through baptism we die and rise again to become God&amp;rsquo;s children, clothed
with Christ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order
that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, we too may live a new life. &lt;strong&gt;Rom 6:4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-christ-jesus-you-are-all-children-of-god-through-faith-for-all-of-you-who-were-baptized-into-christ-have-clothed-yourselves-with-christ-gal-326-27&#34;&gt;In Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. Gal 3:26-27&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we profess faith in Christ and a desire to trust and obey Him, how
can we possibly say that we do not need to repent and be baptised for
the forgiveness of our sins? It is what the bible teaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;baptism-in-the-holy-spirit&#34;&gt;Baptism in the Holy Spirit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition-3&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been taught that everyone who repents of their sins and asks
Jesus into their lives is born-again and automatically receives the Holy
Spirit. Some who are hungry for more of God may later be baptised in the
Holy Spirit and receive various Spiritual gifts, such as speaking in
tongues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command-3&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said that without the HS we are orphans &amp;ndash; starved of love and
unable to relate properly to our Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit is not an optional-extra:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless
they are born of water (baptism) and the Spirit (baptism in the Holy
Spirit).&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;John 3:5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised,
which you have heard me speak about. For John baptized with water, but
in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit&amp;hellip; You will
receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 1:5,8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He saved us through the washing of rebirth (baptism in water) and
renewal by the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Titus 3:5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no assurance of salvation apart from the Holy Spirit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having believed, you were marked in Him with a seal, the promised
Holy Spirit, Who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 1:13-14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We know that we live in Him and He in us, because He has given us of
His Spirit.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;1 John 4:13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Spirit is promised, He is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; given automatically when we
believe in Jesus or are baptised. Jesus taught that we must ask the
Father to give us the Spirit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will
find; knock and the door will be opened to you. &amp;hellip; If you then, though
you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much
more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask
him!&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Luke 11:9-13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, such as for Cornelius (Acts 10:44) God baptises believers in
the Holy Spirit without them praying, but it is much more usual for
prayer to be required, even for baptised believers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy
Spirit, because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they
had simply been baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter and
John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;strong&gt;Acts 8:12-17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On hearing this, they were baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus.
When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and
they spoke in tongues and prophesied. &lt;strong&gt;Acts 19:2-6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere do we see any other understanding of receiving the Holy Spirit
in the New Testament, other than the baptism of the Holy Spirit which
was usually manifested by the recipients&#39; speaking in tongues. On what
authority can we teach baptism in the Holy Spirit as an optional extra?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;repentance-and-righteousness&#34;&gt;Repentance and Righteousness&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition-4&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been taught that in order to be forgiven we need to confess our
sins, and that we need to keep doing this as often as we are aware of
having sinned. We are taught that we are sinners, saved by grace and
will constantly fail in our struggle against temptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command-4&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to
all nations (&lt;strong&gt;Luke 24:47&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out
(&lt;strong&gt;Acts 3:19&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;God has granted repentance that leads to life.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 11:18&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus and the Apostles always associated both repentance and forgiveness
with conversion. Repentance was required for faith &amp;ndash; it is a change of
view about Christ and God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom, not repentance from wrongdoing.
Likewise, forgiveness is eternal saving forgiveness, not short-term
conscience-cleansing forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Acts
10:43&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confession of our sinful acts is never mentioned in connection with
salvation. Teaching about confession is often based upon a
misunderstanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is
not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will
forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1John
1:8-9&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this opening passage of his letter John is talking about the Gospel
he has proclaimed to them; the gospel through which they were saved; the
Gospel that demands repentance from the kingdom of darkness to the
Kingdom of light (v5-7). Those who deny their need for repentance are
deceived, but those who confess their previous deception are made
righteous (v8-10). That this is about salvation rather than our daily
lives as believers is shown in the verses that follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father&amp;mdash;Jesus
Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As believers we live in the wonder of continuing forgiveness because
Jesus&#39; death was sufficient for us. We are now to live in the joy of
knowing that Jesus is our righteousness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves
with Christ. (&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:27&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not supposed to live with a continuing reminder of our sin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 5:1&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being
made holy&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Heb 10:14,17&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with seeing repentance as a daily requirement for dealing
with sinful acts is that it takes our attention away from the major
repentance issue of the focus and direction of our lives and feeds
unbelief and self-righteousness concerning the effectiveness of the
Cross in dealing with our sin once and for all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;joining-a-church&#34;&gt;Joining a Church&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the hardest aspect of tradition for us to recognise is regarding
our concept of church. We readily see that there are a variety of
traditions in the various denominations, but really they are all small
variations on a very dominant theme &amp;ndash; maintaining an institution of
instruction and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest disconnects between the New Testament and church as
we know it must surely be the contrast between the modest attention to
church administration in the New Testament and the massive amount of
effort and resources that we pour into maintaining our church
traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament teaching about &amp;ldquo;church&amp;rdquo; (literally &lt;em&gt;assemblies&lt;/em&gt;) is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disciples of Jesus should assemble together to encourage one another&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and stir one another to love and good works (Heb 10:24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone should take part in this encouragement (1 Cor 14:26,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Thess5:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assemblies should rejoice in song and thanksgiving together (Eph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:18-21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They should share a meal of remembrance together (1 Cor 11:23&amp;ndash;26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus has given us all different gifts to serve the body of Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Rom 12:4-8, Eph 4:11-13, 1 Cor 12:7-11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assemblies in a town should have elders to oversee and correct any&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;false teaching that may arise (Titus 1:5-9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elders are to lead by example and not through control (1 Pet 5:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members are expected to submit to one another and to their overseers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(elders) (Eph 5:21, Heb 13:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assemblies should maintain holiness amongst the members (1 Cor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:12-13).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small and simple set of instructions for assemblies of
disciples which were generally small enough to meet in people&amp;rsquo;s homes
and function like extended families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition-5&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, Church has been transformed from a family into an
institution. The consequences of this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new believer is expected to be committed to attending Sunday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worship every week and to attend the week-day bible study and
prayer meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new believer is likely to be encouraged to get involved in some&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aspect of maintaining the church programs, perhaps helping set
things up before a service or welcoming people when they arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new believer will be encouraged to give financially for the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maintenance of the church programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new believer is likely to see conforming to the culture of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;church as more important than conforming to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command-5&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus spoke at length about what is required for a Christian to be
fruitful. Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t say to join a church, He said to join Him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by
itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless
you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain
in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do
nothing.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;John 15:4-5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus pointed to answered prayer, not progress up a church hierarchy, as
the measure of fruitful discipleship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you
wish, and it will be done for you. This is to my Father&amp;rsquo;s glory, that
you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples &amp;hellip; You did
not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go
and bear fruit&amp;mdash;fruit that will last&amp;mdash;and so that whatever you ask
in my name the Father will give you.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;John 15:7-8, 16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not command that we conform to church culture, but that we
love one another:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have
kept my Father&amp;rsquo;s commands and remain in his love. I have told you this
so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My
command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;John
15:10-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the primary experience within a &amp;lsquo;church&amp;rsquo; is not answered prayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and love for one another, then we have departed from God&amp;rsquo;s pattern
for church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the assembling together does not consist of each one sharing and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;encouraging the other, then we have departed from God&amp;rsquo;s pattern
for church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the assembling together does not include sharing a meal in which&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we celebrate the New Covenant, then we have departed from God&amp;rsquo;s
pattern for church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-truth-that-sets-us-free&#34;&gt;The Truth that Sets us Free&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition-6&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been taught that correct doctrine is of utmost importance; that
personal and corporate bible study is how we grow as disciples; that
&lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; is correct understanding, that knowledge is freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command-6&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.
Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free &amp;hellip; Very
truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin &amp;hellip; if the Son
sets you free, you will be free indeed.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;John 8:31-33&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin is really just another word for idolatry. All sin consists of
thinking that something other than God&amp;rsquo;s perfect will is more desirable.
It is a deceit, because the real truth is that there is never anything
more perfect, more truly satisfying, more comforting, more fulfilling,
more affirming, more exciting, more anything than God&amp;rsquo;s perfect will for
us. So if we sin, it is because we wrongly see something other than God
as better than God. Our &amp;ldquo;eyes&amp;rdquo; are wrong, and because of that we are
deceived and obey that idol - we are slaves to sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the truth that sets us free is not correct doctrine, but Jesus
Himself. I am not led into sin by mistaken or faulty understanding of
the atonement or by misunderstanding a parable or not being able to
expound the letter to the Romans. What I need is a new heart and new
eyes to see and love Jesus. I need to &amp;ldquo;abide&amp;rdquo; in Jesus and let His word
abide in me. The truth that sets us free is not doctrinal, it is
incarnational &amp;ndash; Jesus living in me. This happens through baptism in
water and baptism in the Holy Spirit followed by feeding on the word of
Jesus under the tutorship of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;peace-and-unity&#34;&gt;Peace and Unity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition-7&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are taught to maintain the unity and peace of the local church by
being kind and gentle and tolerant and understanding. Cultures vary
widely in the degree to which people are expected to say what a person
wants to hear, rather than to speak the truth, but we often feel that
the &amp;ldquo;loving&amp;rdquo; thing to do is to say something other than the truth. We
try not to do and say things that might upset others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command-7&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus commands us to love one another as he loves us. These are some of
the ways Jesus loved people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Rev 3:19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus turned and said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;Get behind me, Satan! You are a
stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God,
but merely human concerns.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Matt 16:23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You unbelieving and perverse generation,&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;how long
shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you?&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Matt
17:17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But He turned and rebuked them and said, &amp;ldquo;You do not know what manner
of spirit you are of.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Lk 9:55&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked
them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe
those who had seen him after he had risen. &lt;strong&gt;Mark 16:14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Martha, Martha,&amp;rdquo; the Lord answered, &amp;ldquo;you are worried and upset about
many things, but few things are needed&amp;mdash;or indeed only one. Mary has
chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Lk
10:41-42&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus would not have lasted long in most of our churches. He was far too
outspoken and divisive. But when He rebuked Peter He got to the heart of
the problem: &amp;ldquo;you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely
human concerns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are called to live with Kingdom Culture, not man-made culture. When
deciding what to do and say we should have the concerns of God in mind
and not the fear of man. We are called to love one another as Christ
loves us &amp;ndash; that implies that we need to learn from Jesus what love
truly looks like. In Jesus, love is never divorced from truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;discipleship&#34;&gt;Discipleship&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition-8&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have understood the Great Commission as &amp;ldquo;go and make disciples of all
nations, teaching them everything I have commanded you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We equate faith with doctrine. As a result of this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing and understanding &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; doctrine is our measure of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We equate disciple making with teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preaching and bible study are our primary, and often sole means of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discuss and teach and listen till the cows come home&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keen Christians go to conferences and do more bible study and go to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;theological college so they can become leaders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command-8&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said &amp;ldquo;teach them to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; everything I have commanded you.&amp;rdquo;
He said, &amp;ldquo;Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; it.&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Everyone who hears these words of mine and
does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his
house on sand.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Matt 28:20&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lk 11:28, Matt 7:26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is not understanding and agreeing with doctrinal truth. It is
trusting and obeying Jesus. That is how Jesus defines faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching has an important role to play, but only in conjunction with
demonstrating and practicing obedience. Discipling is an apprenticeship,
not a class-room exercise. The teacher says, &amp;ldquo;Come and follow me&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have abandoned the apprenticeship for the classroom because according
to Jesus, discipleship starts with demonstrating the Kingdom of God
through healing and deliverance. It is so much easier to talk about this
than to actually demonstrate it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mission&#34;&gt;Mission&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition-9&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are taught to bring our friends and neighbours to church so they can
hear the preaching of the Gospel and be saved. The pastor is the expert
and those few who are growing into leadership take a turn now and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command-9&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And as you go, preach, saying, &amp;lsquo;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&amp;rsquo;
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons.
Freely you received, freely give &amp;hellip; And whatever city or village you
enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay at his house until you
leave that city.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Matt 10:7-11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus never said to bring people to church so the pastor could minister
to them. He said to go into people&amp;rsquo;s homes and give away what you have
freely received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our replacement of the simple family assembly with the centralised
church organisation has reversed the focus of mission and ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;becoming-a-leader&#34;&gt;Becoming a Leader&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition-10&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are taught that the church needs leaders to perform all the various
functions and organise all its activities. Leadership positions are
often given (and even created) to reward faithfulness and commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking for leaders we look for people who agree with us, people
who have the skills to lead and organise others, people who are
knowledgeable and skilled in using the bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership is organised in a hierarchy under the lead pastor&amp;rsquo;s authority
and is used as a means of control. Obedience and submission is expected
of those being lead, and the sub-leaders serve the main leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command-10&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus turns leadership on its head. His church structure is flat rather
than hierarchical. He alone is the head, and everyone else reports
directly to Him. Leadership is a gift of service to the body of Christ,
along with all the other gifts that every member provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it
over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so
with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your
servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Mk
10:42-44&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members
do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form
one body, and each member belongs to all the others. &lt;strong&gt;Rom 12:4-5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdom leadership depends not upon authority and duty but on vision,
inspiration, example, empowerment and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have adopted the world&amp;rsquo;s model of leadership within the church,
thinking ourselves wiser than Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;sent-and-released&#34;&gt;Sent and Released&amp;hellip;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tradition-11&#34;&gt;Our Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are taught that if we feel the calling of God to start a new ministry
or leave the church to take the gospel to another place, we need to get
the blessing and release of the pastor. Yet the hardest thing for a
pastor to do is to release leaders or church members to leave the church
to obey their calling to go into all the world and make disciples. These
people are probably the keenest, hardest working, most generous givers,
closest friends and most ardent supporters of the pastor. The temptation
for a pastor is always to say, &amp;ldquo;Just wait a little longer, you are not
quite ready yet&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jesus-command-11&#34;&gt;Jesus&#39; Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Jn 20:21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of
the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.
Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Lk 10:2-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Freely you received, freely give&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Matt 10:8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that none of us are ever ready. There is always more to
learn, more to practice, more to be done before we go. We should always
seek the blessing of those who have been our Christian family, but in
the end we must obey and trust Jesus if he is calling us to go beyond
what our leaders are prepared to allow. Jesus was clear that family does
not trump obedience to Jesus. (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 12:47-50, John 2:3-4&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;union-with-christ----notes-from-rankin-wilbourne&#34;&gt;Union with Christ &amp;ndash; Notes from Rankin Wilbourne&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also my &amp;quot;In Christ&amp;quot; in /Salvation/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P24: Jn 17:3 Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true
God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Jn 1:3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you
also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father
and with his Son, Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eph 1:3-4 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in
Christ. For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be
holy and blameless in his sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Pet 1:3 His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly
life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and
goodness. 4Through these he has given us his very great and precious
promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature,
having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-living-in-the-gap&#34;&gt;1: Living in the Gap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p34: We struggle with the high promises of scripture, such as &amp;quot;greater
things than these will you do&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Whoever drinks of this water will
never thirst again&amp;quot;. If only!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may be more used to thinking of Christ as our Saviour outside of me
than the one who dwells within me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p37: John Murray: &amp;quot;Nothing is more central or more basic than union
with Christ... it is the central truth of the whole doctrine of
salvation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p38: If you have ever asked &amp;quot;Isn&#39;t there more to it than this?&amp;quot; The
answer is &amp;quot;Yes. Union with Christ is the &amp;quot;more to it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p40: Phil 3:12 Not that I have already obtained all this, or have
already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for
which Christ Jesus took hold of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-union-with-christ---what-is-it&#34;&gt;2: Union with Christ - What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p42: Col 3:3 For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in
God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p43: Paul constantly talks about us being &amp;quot;in Christ&amp;quot;. It is the
essence of Christian proclamation and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share in His life, obedience, death, resurrection and ascension:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p45: Gal 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live,
but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith
in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 6:4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in
order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of
the Father, we too may live a new life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Col 3:1 Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts
on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eph 2:6 And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the
heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p48: Our sin, shame, weakness - everything are covered in Christ. We
rest in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Jn 4:18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear,
because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made
perfect in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P49: Jn 14:16-17 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another
advocate to help you and be with you forever&amp;mdash;the Spirit of truth. The
world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But
you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P50: Col 1:27 To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles
the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jn 14:12 Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works
I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these,
because I am going to the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p51: 2 Cor 13:5 Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith;
test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in
you&amp;mdash;unless, of course, you fail the test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P52: Eph 1:18-19 I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened
in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the
riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people, and his
incomparably great power for us who believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P54: Union with Christ is not just an idea to be understood, but a new
reality to be lived, through faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p57: Jn17:26 I have made you known to them, and will continue to make
you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that
I myself may be in them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P58: Eph 4:13-15 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the
knowled 36:26ge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the
whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be
infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by
every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in
their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will
grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head,
that is, Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-why-we-need-it&#34;&gt;3: Why we need it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p60: Rom 12:2 Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be
transformed by the renewing of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezek 36:26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I
will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Cor 2:16 But we have the mind of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eph 4:24 put on the new self, created to be like God in true
righteousness and holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Cor 5:16 So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view.
Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil 2:15 that you may become blameless and pure, &amp;quot;children of God
without fault in a warped and crooked generation.&amp;quot; Then you will shine
among them like stars in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these verses suggest great transformation in our character. Yet the
reality is that we rarely see such wonderful transformation and most of
us feel stuck and unable to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both grace and obedience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P64: Every temptation challenges our belief that the Lord intends only
good for us. If we believed that we would never choose sin. Only those
who believe God is always full of love and goodness towards us can
choose obedience in the face of temptation. This grace changes our
perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P65: But knowledge of that grace, on its own, does not change us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jer 6:14 They dress the wound of my people as though it were not
serious. &#39;Peace, peace,&#39; they say, when there is no peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace without obedience is an inadequate dressing for the wound of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jn 14:15 &amp;quot;If you love me, keep my commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jn 15:14 You are my friends if you do what I command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt 7:21 &amp;quot;Not everyone who says to me, &#39;Lord, Lord,&#39; will enter the
kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who
is in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P67: Using grace as an excuse not to be obedient is utter folly and is
contrary to Jesus and the apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P71: Jesus exemplifies radical grace and radical obedience. We need
both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P72: Both justification and sanctification come from our union with
Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Cor 1:30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has
become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and
redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P73: Jesus provides grace to cover our sin and power to obey his
commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt 6:33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all
these things will be given to you as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil 3:12 Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already
arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ
Jesus took hold of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus we can be honest about our failures because of His grace, and
hopeful of change because of His power in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P75: Addiction to sin occurs when we seek to salve our pain with
anything other than Christ. When we reach for something other than Jesus
when our hearts are troubled, that something will steal life from us &amp;ndash;
with our permission!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P76: When we feel defeated and accused and full of shame we must
remember that Christ is my righteousness and we can boldly approach the
Father in confidence. There is no other way to overcome sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P77: But we must also remember that Christ is in me to break the power
of sin. We can choose to obey: &amp;quot;That is not who I am any more&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Jn 4:4 You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them,
because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the
world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-union-with-christ-in-the-bible&#34;&gt;4: Union with Christ in the Bible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P87: Paul frequently talks about us being &amp;quot;in Christ&amp;quot;. It is not just
a nice phrase, it changes everything about us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Cor 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come:
The old has gone, the new is here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P88: Union with Christ is a closer union than any that can be imagined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Cor 12:27 Now you are the body of Christ, and each of you is a member
of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Cor 3:16 Do you not know that you yourselves are God&amp;rsquo;s temple, and
that God&amp;rsquo;s Spirit dwells in you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eph 4:24 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true
righteousness and holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eph 5:31-32 Married to Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rom 8:39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,
will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus
our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P89: Abide is John&#39;s term for union with Christ: Jn 15:4-5 Remain in
Me, and I will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself
unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you
remain in Me. I am the vine and you are the branches. The one who
remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from Me you
can do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P90: Jn 10:10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have
come that they may have life, and have it to the full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Matthew, Mark and Luke, union with Christ is expressed as the
Kingdom of God. For instance the sermon on the mount describes the new
Kingdom life that union with Christ makes possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P92: Two most common complains about reading the bible are &amp;quot;I don&#39;t
get anything out of it!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I don&#39;t understand it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union with Christ give us the expectation that Jesus will speak to us
through His word and His spirit will help us to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P94: Jn 15:9-11 &amp;ldquo;Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you;
abide in My love. 10&amp;quot;If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My
love; just as I have kept My Father&amp;rsquo;s commandments and abide in His
love. 11&amp;quot;These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you,
and that your joy may be made full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-the-historic-tradition&#34;&gt;5: The Historic Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P104: Luther: Christ and the soul become one flesh as in marriage.
Everything they have they hold in common, the good as well as the evil.
The believing soul can boast of and glory in whatever Christ has as
though it were his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P105: Calvin: We do not therefore contemplate him outside ourselves from
afar in order that his righteousness may be imputed to us but because we
put on Christ and are engrafted into his body &amp;ndash; in short, because He
designs to make us one with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-whatever-happened-to-union-with-christ&#34;&gt;6: Whatever happened to union with Christ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P116: Union with Christ might be the most important doctrine you have
never heard of!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union with Christ can come across as obscure, or too heavenly minded to
be any earthly use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P120: Our culture feeds our self-centredness, encouraging us to enthrone
ourselves as the sovereign of our lives. Pride is now embraced and
cherished as essential to human flourishing: embrace yourself, express
yourself, promote yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P121: Union with Christ tells us that the most important part of our
identity comes from Christ, not ourself. Therefore we need a posture of
dependence, vulnerability, waiting and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A married couple must learn to replace &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; as their
primary frame of reference. The same applies to our union with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P124: We like easy soudbites and clear ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P125: Our desire for clarity can end up narrowing our view of the gospel
to the point where we end up at its centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P126: Col 1:16 For in him all things were created: things in heaven and
on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or
authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jn 17:21 May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you
have sent me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jn 14:21,23 &amp;ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who
loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will
love him and will disclose Myself to him... If anyone loves Me, he will
keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and
make Our abode with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P129: Union with Christ opens the door to a world larger and more
exciting, more mysterious and more dangerous, than you ever imagined.
Your imagination must be captured by a new story so you can keep
pressing onward and upward toward this new world, even as you walk with
both feet on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;walking-in-faith&#34;&gt;Walking in Faith&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is unwavering belief. In fact there is only one Greek word,
&lt;em&gt;pistis&lt;/em&gt;, which is sometimes translated belief and sometimes faith. To
have faith is to believe with all your heart. If you are born again then
you are a believer; that is God has given you faith; the ability to
believe Him and His word. This study is about putting our believing into
practice, exercising the faith God has given us for the very purpose He
has given it: that is to believe His word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Faith comes from hearing (or reading) the message and the message is
heard through the word of Christ.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 10:17&lt;/strong&gt;) But we should not
mistake faith for intellectual knowledge. We may have God&amp;rsquo;s word in our
mind and say we believe it, because we know we are supposed to believe
it, but we only truly believe when we believe with our hearts. We hear
with our ears, understand with our minds and believe with our hearts,
&amp;ldquo;for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom
10:10&lt;/strong&gt;). It is this last stage that we so often fail to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we know if we believe with our heart? Because we act on it. As
James said, &amp;ldquo;faith without works is dead.&amp;rdquo; When we truly and joyfully
believe God&amp;rsquo;s word we will eagerly and joyfully act on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s word is the most precious earthly possession we have. God has
given us &amp;ldquo;his very great and precious promises, so that through them you
may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the
world caused by evil desires&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;2Pet 1:4&lt;/strong&gt;). If we are to benefit from
these promises and participate in the divine nature, then we must read
and study and meditate on these promises until we believe them with all
our heart and so prove that &amp;ldquo;all the promises of God find their YES in
him.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;2Cor 1:20 RSV&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, &amp;ldquo;do not let this Book of the Law depart from your
mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do
everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.&amp;rdquo;
God assures us &amp;ldquo;Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do
not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be
with you wherever you go.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jos 1:8-9&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can be fully confident in God&amp;rsquo;s promises, for &amp;ldquo;God is not a man, that
he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he
speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfil?&amp;quot;(&lt;strong&gt;Num 23:19&lt;/strong&gt;)
No! God assures us &amp;ldquo;I am watching to see that my word is fulfilled&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Jer 1:12&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prayers-of-faith-please-god&#34;&gt;Prayers of faith please God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People always want to know, &amp;ldquo;What is the secret of your ministry?&amp;rdquo; I
think the big discovery for me was that God is pleased when I move out
in faith because I am believing His promises. It is this deep conviction
that it pleases God which carries me forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verse most Christians know about pleasing God is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who
comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who
earnestly seek him&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 11:6&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All through the scriptures we see that it is people putting their trust
in God for His protection and provision that pleases Him. And on the
other hand, it is plain that Jesus was frustrated by the faithlessness
of His disciples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How
long shall I suffer you? (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 17:17&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to please Jesus rather than frustrate Him then you need to
be courageous in your faith. The Devil tries to persuade us that God is
a distant and reluctant giver who needs to be &amp;ldquo;sweetened&amp;rdquo; by extra
effort at being righteous and cajoled with long and loud prayers. Satan
tells us that the more we pray the more likely God is to hear, and the
more people we get praying the more likely God is to answer. And even if
God does hear us and answer, then the answer will most likely be &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; or
&amp;ldquo;Wait&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;. These are lies we must resist. God has made us
righteous in Christ, loves to hear us pray and is eager to grant our
requests. Paul encourages us to believe that God&amp;rsquo;s answer is &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; when
we pray:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;all the promises of God find their YES in him.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;2Cor 1:20 RSV&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus assures us that coming to Him with our requests is not tiresome
for Him, but rather it gives Him great pleasure to answer our prayers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to
you. Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father&amp;rsquo;s good pleasure to
give you the kingdom. (&lt;strong&gt;Lk 12:31-32&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not only does it delight the Father when we come to Him with prayers
of faith, it also glorifies Him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish,
and it will be given you. This is to my Father&amp;rsquo;s glory, that you bear
much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. (&lt;strong&gt;Jn 15:7-8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus takes personal responsibility for our prayers being answered, so
that He may bring glory to the Father:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring
glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will
do it. (&lt;strong&gt;Jn 14:13-14&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motive Jesus gives us for asking is not only the Fathers pleasure,
and the Son&amp;rsquo;s pleasure, but our own pleasure as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may
be complete.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Joh 15:11&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth,
my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have
not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your
joy will be complete.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Joh 16:23-24&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that Jesus knew it would be difficult for us to accept that
God actually wants to hear and grant our requests. Again and again he
repeated His promise that God would not only answer our prayers, but
actually grant our requests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to
your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good
gifts to those who ask him!&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 7:11&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is even more reason than God&amp;rsquo;s pleasure for Him answering our
prayers. The Devil wants people to believe that the Christian faith is
just words and ideas with no present powerful reality; that its all just
&amp;ldquo;pie in the sky when you die.&amp;rdquo; That until we get to heaven Satan rules
and sin and sickness will remain our masters. But this is not the Gospel
Jesus preached. Jesus announced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;good news to the poor, freedom for the prisoners, recovery of sight for
the blind and release for the oppressed. To proclaim the year of the
Lord&amp;rsquo;s favour.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Lk 4:18-19&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil&amp;rsquo;s work.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;1Jo 3:8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul was insistent in His preaching that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but &lt;strong&gt;of power&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Co
4:20&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to please God then let us be sure that we proclaim the Gospel
of forgiveness and healing and that we pray in the full confidence that
in boldly asking God for the demonstration of His Kingdom here on earth,
we are pleasing Him and He will certainly grant our requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have inherited precious and very great promises, and God&amp;rsquo;s answer to
them is &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;. This is ground upon which we stand and from where we will
not be shifted. As Paul said, &amp;ldquo;Let God be true and every man a liar&amp;rdquo;.
(&lt;strong&gt;Rom 3:4&lt;/strong&gt;) Believing God in faith-filled prayers is fun and so much
nicer than struggling with unbelief!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in
him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy
Spirit.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ro 15:13&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1---the-authentic-gospel&#34;&gt;Part 1 - The Authentic Gospel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-power-of-the-gospel-in-a-challenging-context&#34;&gt;The power of the gospel in a challenging context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life as a Christian in this fallen world is often very challenging. Just
because we have inherited God&amp;rsquo;s precious and very great promises does
not mean that we will not suffer from the godless behaviour of others.
&amp;ldquo;Stephen, a man full of God&amp;rsquo;s grace and power, did great wonders and
miraculous signs among the people&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ac 6:8&lt;/strong&gt;) but he was martyred.
Paul likewise was full of grace and power but he suffered greatly from
physical attack at the hands of unbelievers, on at least one occasion
being stoned and left for dead (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 14:19&lt;/strong&gt;) Paul addresses the issue
of presenting the gospel in a challenging context at some length in
writing to the Corinthians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore, since through God&amp;rsquo;s mercy we have this ministry, we &lt;strong&gt;do not
lose heart&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we
&lt;strong&gt;do not use deception&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;nor do we distort the word of God&lt;/strong&gt;. On the
contrary, by &lt;strong&gt;setting forth the truth plainly&lt;/strong&gt; we commend ourselves to
every man&amp;rsquo;s conscience in the sight of God. &amp;hellip; But we &lt;strong&gt;have this
treasure in jars of clay&lt;/strong&gt; to show that this &lt;strong&gt;all-surpassing power&lt;/strong&gt; is
from God and not from us. We are hard pressed on every side, but not
crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned;
struck down, but not destroyed. We always carry &lt;strong&gt;around in our body the
death of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;, so that the &lt;strong&gt;life of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt; may also be &lt;strong&gt;revealed
in our body&lt;/strong&gt;. For we who are alive are always being given over to death
for Jesus&#39; sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body. So
then, &lt;strong&gt;death is at work in us, but life is at work in you&lt;/strong&gt;. It is
written: &amp;ldquo;I believed; therefore I have spoken.&amp;rdquo; With that same spirit of
faith &lt;strong&gt;we also believe and therefore speak&lt;/strong&gt;, because we know that the
one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with
Jesus and present us with you in his presence. All this is for your
benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may
cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God. Therefore &lt;strong&gt;we do
not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away&lt;/strong&gt;, yet inwardly we
are &lt;strong&gt;being renewed day by day&lt;/strong&gt;. For our light and momentary troubles
are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So
&lt;strong&gt;we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen&lt;/strong&gt;. For
&lt;strong&gt;what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;2Co
4:1-18&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of key points to notice here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must &lt;strong&gt;not lose heart&lt;/strong&gt;. Satan will try everything he can to
discourage us (lit. to take away our courage). This we must
determine not to allow. Nothing we face can undo the promises of
God, remove us from His love or disable God from watching over His
promises to perform them (&lt;strong&gt;Jer 1:12&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must &lt;strong&gt;not fake it&lt;/strong&gt;. It is tempting to pretend things are better
than they are or that something has happened when it hasn&amp;rsquo;t. We are
not as like Jesus as we should be and we understand in part the
unsearchable wisdom of God. Even Paul made definite plans which
never worked out (&lt;strong&gt;2Cor 1:17&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must &lt;strong&gt;not distort the word of God&lt;/strong&gt;. The preachers greatest
temptation is to distort the word of God to make it say what we want
it to say for the purpose of our sermon. It is very difficult to
avoid this completely however careful we are, but we must &amp;ldquo;Do your
best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does
not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;2Tim 2:15&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must &lt;strong&gt;set forth the truth plainly&lt;/strong&gt;. Our job is to tell the
truth of the Gospel that God gives us in the scriptures. The truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth. If Jesus says that the
kingdom is accompanied by healing, that is the Gospel we must
proclaim. If Jesus says that God acts in response to our faith, that
is the Gospel we must proclaim. If Jesus says that He Himself is the
judge of all mankind then we must not hesitate to say so. Jesus
defines the Gospel, not the sensibilities of our present society.
Jesus, not Caesar, is Lord of all the earth. If we plainly speak the
truth delivered to us by Jesus then we &amp;ldquo;commend ourselves to every
man&amp;rsquo;s conscience in the sight of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have this treasure in jars of clay.&lt;/strong&gt; The Gospel is amazing &amp;ndash;
we are not! Our frailty and imperfections are not a hindrance to the
gospel, but on the contrary, they make it all the clearer that it is
God&amp;rsquo;s power at work and not ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Gospel shows all-surpassing power&lt;/strong&gt;. If there is no power,
nothing is shown! There is to be a stark contrast between the clay
vessels and His all-surpassing power. The Gospel is not clay
vessels, it is the power of God for salvation. (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 1:16&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;body displays both the death and the life of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;.
Jesus died at the hands of sinners. The display of the death of
Jesus in our bodies is not in sickness and the frailty of old age
but in the cuts and bruises and broken bones received from others
because we have stood our ground in proclaiming God&amp;rsquo;s Gospel. Or
perhaps it is the lost promotion or opportunities because we refuse
to act corruptly in our work. Nowhere in the bible is sickness
spoken of as a way of sharing in Christ&amp;rsquo;s sufferings. Jesus was
never sick. The only way we share in Christ&amp;rsquo;s sufferings is when we
suffer as a result of our faith. But Paul is clear that it is not
just the death of Jesus that is displayed in his body, but also the
life of Jesus. Every time he suffered so terribly in persecutions,
God raised him up again. His body displayed both the scars of
persecution and the insuppressible healing life of Jesus &amp;ndash; also
&lt;strong&gt;in his mortal body&lt;/strong&gt;. Our mortal bodies, not just our hearts or
spirits, are supposed to display the life of Jesus. This is through
vitality and health, not sickness and decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that same spirit of faith &lt;strong&gt;we believe and therefore speak&lt;/strong&gt;.
Paul is very much in line with Jesus on the issue of faith. We
believe and therefore speak; not like the west-trained person, we
&lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; therefore we believe therefore we speak. The resurrection of
Jesus is enough to prove God&amp;rsquo;s power and passion for His word. Faith
enables us to speak out the truth because of our confidence in God
before ever we see the thing we are speaking of. That is what faith
does; it is how faith works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;
Unbelievers and those who have lost heart look at what is seen,
waiting to see the evidence of what is being hoped for. Believers do
not look at the present visible realities. Their eyes are fixed on
Jesus. They see the unseen realities of the promises of God being
fulfilled. They see the answer to their prayer which is about to
replace the temporary present visible reality. What is seen is
temporary. God has changed it in response to my prayer of faith. God
and His faithfulness is eternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the many challenges and considerable difficulties that Paul
faced as he preached the Gospel it is clear that he never shrank from
proclaiming the power of God in the gospel. In writing to the Romans
about his ministry he says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has
accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I
have said and done&amp;mdash; by the power of signs and miracles, through the
power of the Spirit.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 15:18-19&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;healing-is-a-part-of-the-authentic-gospel&#34;&gt;Healing is a part of the authentic Gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The miracle of rebirth &amp;ndash; a person being born-again and filled with the
Holy Spirit &amp;ndash; is received by faith. Part of God&amp;rsquo;s provision to help
unbelievers have faith in the Gospel of salvation is to accompany the
preaching of the gospel with signs and wonders &amp;ndash; usually healing
miracles. Healing has a two-fold role in proclaiming the gospel. Firstly
it demonstrates the reality of the salvation that God brings. It is not
just an &lt;em&gt;invisible&lt;/em&gt; salvation from God&amp;rsquo;s judgement of our sin, it is
also a &lt;em&gt;visible&lt;/em&gt; salvation from the sickness that has come as a result
of the fall, so that &amp;ldquo;your faith may not rest on the wisdom of men but
on the power of God&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Cor 2:5&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach
good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the
prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed,
to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favour.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Lk 4:18-19&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But secondly, healing is a demonstration of God&amp;rsquo;s approval of the
message being preached. As one gospel witness put it, &amp;ldquo;No-one could
perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Jn 3:2&lt;/strong&gt;). Jesus repeatedly pointed to the healing miracles as proof
that His message was authentic - people were being healed and delivered
from the power of Satan (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 11:4-5, John 14:11&lt;/strong&gt;). Jesus sent the
disciples off with the same message and the same authenticating signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus had called the Twelve together, &lt;strong&gt;he gave them power and
authority&lt;/strong&gt; to drive out all demons and &lt;strong&gt;to cure diseases&lt;/strong&gt;, and he
sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. (&lt;strong&gt;Lk
9:1&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these signs will accompany those who believe: &lt;strong&gt;In my name&lt;/strong&gt; they
will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up
snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not
hurt them at all; &lt;strong&gt;they will place their hands on sick people, and&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;they will get well&lt;/strong&gt;. (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 16:17-18&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples continued to preach the gospel with signs following after
Jesus&#39; ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone was filled with awe, and &lt;strong&gt;many wonders and miraculous signs
were done&lt;/strong&gt; by the apostles.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ac 2:43&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there.
When the crowds heard Philip and saw the &lt;strong&gt;miraculous signs&lt;/strong&gt; he did,
they all paid close attention to what he said. With shrieks, evil
spirits came out of many, and &lt;strong&gt;many paralytics and cripples were
healed&lt;/strong&gt;. So there was great joy in that city.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ac 8:5-8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has
accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I
have said and done&amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;by the power of signs and miracles&lt;/strong&gt;, through
the power of the Spirit.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 15:18-19&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive
&lt;strong&gt;words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s power, so that your
faith&lt;/strong&gt; might not rest on men&amp;rsquo;s wisdom, but on God&amp;rsquo;s power.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Co
2:4-5&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but &lt;strong&gt;of power&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;1Co 4:20&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to
us by those who heard him. God also testified to it by &lt;strong&gt;signs, wonders
and various miracles&lt;/strong&gt;, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed
according to his will.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 2:3-4&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be no doubt that it was and is Jesus&#39; intention that signs and
wonders and particularly healing should be a routine part of presenting
the gospel. Freedom from Satan&amp;rsquo;s power does not only relate to spiritual
matters, but also to the curse of the flesh &amp;ndash; sickness. These signs
authenticate the gospel and demonstrate that the Christian faith is not
just about ideas and words, but the power of God to change lives and
deliver people from the devils works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil&amp;rsquo;s work.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;1Jo 3:8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;healing-is-gods-will-for-christians&#34;&gt;Healing is God&amp;rsquo;s will for Christians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But healing is not just for authenticating the preaching of the gospel.
It is important to understand that healing and general blessing is God&amp;rsquo;s
declared will for us as Christians. When we pray for healing, depending
on God&amp;rsquo;s word, we are praying in accord with His will and pleasing Him
by our faith. &amp;ldquo;For without faith it is impossible to please God, because
anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards
those who earnestly seek him&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 11:6&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must not fall for the devils lies that obtaining healing requires
extracting something from God that He is reluctant or uncertain to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for
us, for it is written: &amp;lsquo;Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.&#39;&amp;rdquo; (The
curse of the law was poverty, sickness and death for disobedience.) &amp;ldquo;He
redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to
the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the
promise of the Spirit.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:13-14&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we
considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. But he
was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities;
the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we
are healed.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Isa 53:4-5&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: &amp;ldquo;He took
up our infirmities and carried our diseases.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mt 8:17&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die
to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;1Pe 2:24&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray
over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer
offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him
up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins
to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The
prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jas 5:14-16&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have discussed the application of Isa 53:4-5 and its NT quotations (Mt
8:17, 1Pe 2:24) in my notes &amp;ldquo;Jesus, the Kingdom and Healing, Part 5 -
The Biblical Foundations for healing&amp;rdquo;. Suffice to say here that the
apostles taught and practiced the expectation of divine healing in the
understanding that it was certainly God&amp;rsquo;s will. James does not encourage
prayer for healing because it sometimes helps but because God has
already promised. Notice how he mirrors Jesus&amp;rsquo; teaching on faith: &amp;ldquo;the
prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the condition
upon which healing depends is not God&amp;rsquo;s will, but the faith of the one
praying. In response to a faith-filled prayer, James has no hesitation
in declaring, &amp;ldquo;the Lord will raise him up&amp;rdquo; and then, as a bonus, &amp;ldquo;If he
has sinned, he will be forgiven.&amp;rdquo; Here we see the confident declaration
that God acts in grace towards sinners. Healing and forgiveness is given
to undeserving sinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can confidently declare with James that healing is certainly God&amp;rsquo;s
will and it is obtained by the prayer of faith. In the light of healing
being so much part of Jesus&#39; ministry, and his commission to the
disciples, healing is surely included in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in
you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your
mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ro 8:11&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all&amp;mdash;how will
he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ro
8:32&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life
of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. For we who are alive are
always being given over to death for Jesus&#39; sake, so that his life may
be revealed in our mortal body.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;2Co 4:10-11&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need have no doubt that it is God&amp;rsquo;s will for the life of the risen
Christ to be manifest through health in our mortal bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;our-superior-covenant-blessings&#34;&gt;Our Superior Covenant Blessings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament is bold in its proclamation that in Christ we are
brought into a new and better covenant than Moses&#39; covenant of Law which
constituted the Jewish faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the
covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, and it is
founded on better promises.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 8:6&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New covenant is even better! Under the Old Covenant God&amp;rsquo;s presence
was hidden away in the temple behind a great thick curtain where only
the high priest could go, and that, only once a year. But now, in
Christ&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is
in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were
bought at a price. Therefore honour God with your body.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Co
6:19-20&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are God&amp;rsquo;s temple, filled with the Holy Spirit. But note that Paul
does not say our spirit is the temple, but he specifically says &amp;ldquo;your
&lt;strong&gt;body&lt;/strong&gt; is a temple of the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo; Paul uses this fact to urge
his readers not to commit sexual sin. But it has wider implications.
Jesus said that His Kingdom was not of this world, but that certainly
did not mean that it has no implications or visibility in this world. On
the contrary, wherever the Kingdom of God was proclaimed its
implications broke into this present physical world &amp;ndash; the sick were
healed and the oppressed set free. So much so that Paul says that
creation is moved to jealousy awaiting the day when &amp;ldquo;creation itself
will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the
glorious freedom of the children of God&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 8:17-23&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are to honour God with our body we should ensure that healing,
not sickness, reigns in our body. Not only have our spirits been
purchased by Christ, but our bodies have too. We belong to the Kingdom
of God, which is not merely a matter of words, &amp;ldquo;For the kingdom of God
is not a matter of talk but of power.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Co 4:20&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Jesus&#39; kingdom is not of this world, we have been brought into
His kingdom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the
inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us
from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son
he loves,&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Col 1:12-13&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this kingdom we know we are under God&amp;rsquo;s blessing and recipients of
His many and great promises (&lt;strong&gt;2Pet 1:4&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For no matter how many promises God has made, they are &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; in Christ.
And so through him the &amp;ldquo;Amen&amp;rdquo; is spoken by us to the glory of God.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;2Co 1:20&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these promises, which Paul specifically applies to gentile
believers is blessing and long life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. &amp;lsquo;Honour
your father and mother&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;which is the first commandment with a
promise&amp;mdash; &amp;lsquo;that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long
life on the earth.&#39;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Eph 6:1-3&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is confident that we can take these promises given under the old
covenant and know that in Christ, when we bring these promises to God,
His answer is &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Amen&amp;rdquo;. Even David under the Old Covenant had
confidence in God for healing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD will sustain him on his sick-bed and restore him from his bed
of illness. (&lt;strong&gt;Ps 41:3&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits&amp;mdash; who
forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ps 103:2-3&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the nature of the blessings we have inherited? Abraham&amp;rsquo;s
blessing was threefold in nature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. It was a material or a financial blessing (&lt;strong&gt;Gen 13:2,15; Deut
28:4-12&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. It was a physical blessing (&lt;strong&gt;Gen 13:16; 17:16; Ex 15:26;
23:25-26&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. It was a spiritual blessing (&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:14&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These blessings were made conditional for Israel under the Law of Moses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;if you will diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD your god, and
do that which is right in his eyes, and give heed to his commandments
and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon you
which I put upon the Egyptians; for I am the LORD, your healer.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ex
15:26&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The LORD will send a blessing on your barns and on everything you put
your hand to. The LORD your God will bless you in the land he is giving
you.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;De 28:8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The LORD will grant you abundant prosperity&amp;mdash;in the fruit of your
womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your ground&amp;mdash;in the
land he swore to your forefathers to give you. The LORD will open the
heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send rain on your land in
season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many
nations but will borrow from none. The LORD will make you the head, not
the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD your God that
I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the
top, never at the bottom.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;De 28:11-13&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been delivered from the curse of the Law which, until Jesus
came, the people of God were under. We have been made righteous in God&amp;rsquo;s
sight and so now all the promises of God find their &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see how superior our covenant is and grow strong in your
faith, then I recommend you list all the scriptures in the epistles that
have the expression &amp;ldquo;in Him,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;in Christ,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;in whom,&amp;rdquo; referring to
Jesus (134 of them!). If you make a habit of confessing who you are and
what you have from these scriptures you will become mighty in faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-2---how-faith-works&#34;&gt;Part 2 - How Faith works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;god-answers-prayer-in-response-to-faith&#34;&gt;God answers prayer in response to faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus made it quite clear that miracles and answered prayer was God&amp;rsquo;s
will for us, yet it depends to a large extent on our faith; our
confident belief that we will get what we ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus taught this very plainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Everything is possible for him who believes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;hellip; I tell you the
truth, if anyone says to this mountain, &amp;lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the
sea,&amp;rsquo; and does not doubt in his heart but &lt;strong&gt;believes that what he says
will happen&lt;/strong&gt;, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever
you ask for in prayer, &lt;strong&gt;believe that you have received it, and it will
be yours&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 11:22-24&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He replied, &amp;ldquo;Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth,
&lt;strong&gt;if you have faith&lt;/strong&gt; as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this
mountain, &amp;lsquo;Move from here to there&amp;rsquo; and it will move. &lt;strong&gt;Nothing will be
impossible for you&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 17:20&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not
doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig-tree, but also you
can say to this mountain, &amp;lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,&amp;rsquo; and it will
be done. &lt;strong&gt;If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in
prayer.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 21:21-22&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that New Testament believers were taught to have this
confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all&amp;mdash;how will
he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ro
8:32&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask
anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he
hears us&amp;mdash;whatever we ask&amp;mdash;we know that we have what we asked of him.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;1Jo 5:14-15&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yet you do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive,
because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures. (&lt;strong&gt;Jas
4:2-3&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus healed people who had faith for healing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;According to your faith will it be done to you&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mt 9:29&lt;/strong&gt;) &amp;ndash;
healing the blind man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everything is possible for him who believes.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 9:23&lt;/strong&gt;) &amp;ndash; casting
out a demon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Daughter, your faith has healed you.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 5:34&lt;/strong&gt;) &amp;ndash; woman with flow
of blood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples healed people who had faith for healing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In Lystra there sat a man crippled in his feet, who was lame from birth
and had never walked. He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul
looked directly at him, &lt;strong&gt;saw that he had faith to be healed&lt;/strong&gt; and
called out, &amp;ldquo;Stand up on your feet!&amp;rdquo; At that, the man jumped up and
began to walk.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ac 14:7-10&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[]{#_Toc349392282 .anchor}So we see that faith in the one receiving from
God is crucial. This is a big challenge in the developed world where the
primary dependence for health is on the medical profession. But in all
cultures, faith for a visible healing seems to be much more difficult
than for healing aches and pains. It takes love and grace and care when
ministering to a sick person with little faith. We must do all we can to
help them catch our faith, confess the faith they do have and act on
that faith in some way. Our faith in ministering will communicate and be
responded to by those we pray for but in fact love is the most effective
means of helping someone come to faith. A mighty man of faith who just
goes along a line touching people does nothing to nurture the bruised
faith of a hurting soul. But love will fan a flicker of faith into a
bright flame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unbelief-hinders-answered-prayer&#34;&gt;Unbelief hinders answered prayer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Jesus was limited in His miracles by the faith or unbelief of those
around Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick
people and heal them. And he was amazed at their lack of faith.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mk
6:5-6&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If even Jesus required faith in those being healed, it is hardly
surprising if that is the case for us also. I think this goes a long way
to explaining why healing is far easier in Africa than it is in the
west. We in the west are taught to be sceptical not believing. On
occasions Jesus took people aside to heal them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;quot;Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep.&amp;quot; But they
laughed at him. After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and
took the girl by the hand, and she got up. (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 9:24-25&lt;/strong&gt;) (Healing
Jairus&amp;rsquo; daughter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly
talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man. After &lt;strong&gt;he took
him aside&lt;/strong&gt;, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man&amp;rsquo;s
ears. Then he spat and touched the man&amp;rsquo;s tongue. (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 7:32-33&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged
Jesus to touch him. He took the blind man by the hand and &lt;strong&gt;led him
outside the village&lt;/strong&gt;. When he had spat on the man&amp;rsquo;s eyes and put his
hands on him, Jesus asked, &amp;ldquo;Do you see anything?&amp;rdquo; He looked up and said,
&amp;ldquo;I see people; they look like trees walking around.&amp;rdquo; Once more Jesus put
his hands on the man&amp;rsquo;s eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was
restored, and he saw everything clearly. Jesus sent him home, saying,
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t go into the village.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 8:22-26&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems likely that the reason Jesus took these two people away from
the crowds was the same as with Jairus&#39; daughter, the atmosphere of
unbelief. This perhaps is also why the blind man was told not to go back
into the village &amp;ndash; he would have been in danger of losing his healing
through their unbelief. Where onlookers are sceptical, prayer should be
conducted in private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only the faith of the recipient that needs to be protected,
but also the faith of the one ministering. Perhaps this is what happened
when the disciples failed to cast the demon out after the
transfiguration (&lt;strong&gt;Lk 9&lt;/strong&gt;). By then they had a track record of success
in dealing with demons (&lt;strong&gt;Lk 9:1, 10:17&lt;/strong&gt;). But a father brought them
his son for deliverance and perhaps he was a little dubious about the
disciples praying, preferring the Master Himself. He was certainly
struggling to find faith for he later said to Jesus, &amp;ldquo;If you can do
anything, take pity on us and help us&amp;hellip; help me overcome my unbelief!&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Mk 9:22&lt;/strong&gt;) It is evident that this poor father was gripped by fear
and unbelief. Perhaps this infected the disciples, for when they saw the
boy convulsing on the ground (as he also did for Jesus) they started to
doubt. However, had the disciples stood fast on the authority that Jesus
had given them, they would have succeeded, for Jesus had given them
authority over &amp;ldquo;every demon&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Lk 9:1&lt;/strong&gt;). Jesus came to the rescue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed
from that moment. Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked,
&amp;ldquo;Why couldn&amp;rsquo;t we drive it out?&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;Because you have so little
faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard
seed, you can say to this mountain, &amp;lsquo;Move from here to there&amp;rsquo; and it
will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mt 17:18-20&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word translated &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; faith can equally be translated
&amp;ldquo;short-lived&amp;rdquo; faith, and that seems to be the meaning here. Jesus said
they didn&amp;rsquo;t need big faith, but only faith as small as a mustard seed.
We should not be persuaded by the devil that our faith is too small or
too weak. The problem was not the smallness of their faith but that they
gave up on it. It was short-lived. As soon as they saw the boy fitting
they said, &amp;ldquo;We cannot do it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the same problem with Peter walking on the water. His faith was
not too small &amp;ndash; he is the only man known to have walked on water other
than Jesus. But his faith was short-lived. When he saw the wind he was
afraid. He let go of his great faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came towards
Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink,
cried out, &amp;ldquo;Lord, save me!&amp;rdquo; Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and
caught him. &amp;ldquo;You of little (short-lived) faith,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;why did you
doubt?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mt 14:29-31&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often Jesus intervenes when our faith fails, as in the incidents above.
But in each case Jesus rebuked the disciples for their failed faith
because He wanted them to succeed by their own faith, not His. We must
keep our eyes firmly on Jesus and keep our faith fighting fit. When the
disciples saw the boy fitting and when Peter saw the weather they gave
up believing. It is persevering faith, not great faith, that wins the
victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through
faith and patience inherit what has been promised. (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 6:12&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. You
need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will
receive what he has promised. (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 10:35-36&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, unbelief caused Israel to spend 40 years wandering in the
desert when they could have entered the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;faith-is-fact&#34;&gt;Faith is Fact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen the importance of faith and the danger of unbelief, but how
do we get faith? Where does it come from? Many people seem to think that
faith is just wishful thinking, wanting something to be true or that it
is blind belief in something for which there is no evidence. This is not
the faith of the Bible. Whenever God asks us to have faith He points to
evidence upon which our faith should be based. We have faith in God
doing the &amp;ldquo;impossible&amp;rdquo; because He created everything out of nothing
(&lt;strong&gt;Jer 32:17&lt;/strong&gt;), we have faith in Jesus&#39; teaching because of the
miracles (&lt;strong&gt;Jn 14:11&lt;/strong&gt;), we believe Jesus was the Son of God because God
raised Him from death. It is because faith is evidence based that it is
strengthened through trials. The issue that determines our faith is the
evidence we chose to look at, and the challenge of faith is that the
evidence is so often unseen or at least somewhat removed from the issue
we are confronting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when praying for healing the immediate evidence is
sickness and defeat. But we need to look to the less immediate evidence
of previous healings, the promises of God, the evidence for the gospel
in changed lives and the inner witness of the Holy Spirit. Faith is
based on fact, but we have to choose the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often look to biblical promises as a source of faith, but promises
are the foundation of hope not faith. Facts are the foundation of faith.
For example, in a promise God says, &amp;ldquo;I will deliver you from all your
fears.&amp;rdquo; This gives us hope. But this hope will not deliver us from fear.
A fearful Christian can memorise and quote this promise a thousand times
without ever being delivered from fear. They may say, &amp;ldquo;One day God will
deliver me, because I have this promise&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; But they may never be free
from fear. This is because God&amp;rsquo;s promises require faith for them to
work, and the promise does not produce faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find faith for this promise we need to look for facts. What reasons
are there to believe that God will perform His promise? What biblical
and historical records show me that God is faithful to perform His
promises? What has God already done to fulfil this promise? To these
facts the Holy Spirit adds His witness in our spirits. Faith transforms
the promise into an experienced reality. &amp;ldquo;Faith is the substance of
things hoped for&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 11:1&lt;/strong&gt; NKJV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some promises have been transformed into fact by what Jesus has done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we
considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. But he
was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities;
the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we
are healed.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Isa 53:4-5&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally this was a promise upon which the hope of a coming messiah
was based. But the promise has been fulfilled in Jesus and so now it has
become a statement of fact. For Christians it is a foundation, not of
hope, but of faith. We do not hope that Jesus took our sins and obtained
our healing, it has been done. The matter is not one of hope but of
faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing comes to us because of facts, established in history, not
because of hope in future promises. Jesus didn&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;I will heal you if
you pray right and if it is my Fathers will.&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;All authority in
heaven and earth has been given to me &amp;hellip; Go and place your hands on the
sick and they will get well.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 28:18, Mk 16:15-18&lt;/strong&gt;). The
statement of fact comes first (All authority in heaven and earth has
been given to me) and is the foundation for faith. The promise (the sick
will get well) flows from that fact and gives us hope that our prayers
will be answered. Faith in the fact of Jesus&#39; authority turns that
promise of healing into present reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the promises of scripture, look for the facts that they
are based on. It is those facts that are the foundation of faith in
those promises. Here is another example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray
over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer
offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him
up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins
to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The
prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;James
5:14-16&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note in the next verse Elijah, &amp;ldquo;a man with like passions as us&amp;rdquo; is
quoted as being righteous. By faith in Christ we are righteous, not
because we are especially sanctified).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here James makes the promise, on behalf of God, that the Lord will raise
up a sick person in response to the prayer of faith. Note how
confidently the promise is expressed - &amp;hellip; will make &amp;hellip; will raise
&amp;hellip;will be. This promised is based on a statement of fact: &amp;ldquo;The prayer
of a righteous man is powerful and effective.&amp;rdquo; This fact is offered as
the foundation of faith in the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some more examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to
you. Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father&amp;rsquo;s good pleasure to
give you the kingdom. (&lt;strong&gt;Lk 12:31-32&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish,
and it will be given you. This is to my Father&amp;rsquo;s glory, that you bear
much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. (&lt;strong&gt;Jn 15:7-8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again we see Jesus giving a promise and then making a statement of fact
upon which faith in the promise is founded. If you want to grow strong
in your faith, look to the facts, not just the promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;faith-precedes-sight&#34;&gt;Faith precedes sight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although faith is indeed founded on fact, that is not all there is to
it. Faith is founded on fact, but then launches out in courage to take
hold of the promise. Most of us are inclined to be like Thomas: the only
facts that matter are the ones our ordinary senses can tell us. We
believe it when we see it. Only when we receive what we are asking God
for do we believe we have it. Jesus rebuked the disciples for their
unbelief and blessed those who believe without first seeing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas said to them, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Unless I see&lt;/strong&gt; the nail marks in his hands and
put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, &lt;strong&gt;I
will not believe it&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jn 20:25&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them
for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who
had seen him after he had risen. (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 16:14&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith works the other way around. What pleases God is when we believe we
have our petition before we see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus told him, &amp;ldquo;Because you have seen me, you have believed;
&lt;strong&gt;blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jn
20:29&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these two quotes are not in the context of prayer, they are
examples of natural unbelief on the one hand and the kind of people God
blesses on the other. Jesus was absolutely clear about the kind of faith
that pleases God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, &amp;lsquo;Go, throw
yourself into the sea,&amp;rsquo; and does not doubt in his heart but &lt;strong&gt;believes
that&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;what he says will happen&lt;/strong&gt;, it will be done for him. Therefore
I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, &lt;strong&gt;believe that you have
received&lt;/strong&gt; it, and &lt;strong&gt;it&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;will be yours&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 11:23-24&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note there are three stages in receiving a request here. The pre-prayer
faith the post-prayer faith and receiving the outcome. Pre-prayer faith
says &amp;ldquo;What I say will happen&amp;rdquo;. Post-prayer faith says &amp;ldquo;I have received
it&amp;rdquo;. It is only &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; these two aspects of faith have been played out
that the final stage occurs, &amp;ldquo;it will be yours.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine faith goes beyond asking. It includes the confident belief that
having prayed God has granted the request. John says the same thing,
several decades later, writing as an old man:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask
anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he
hears us&amp;mdash;whatever we ask&amp;mdash;we know that we have what we asked of him.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;1Jo 5:14-15&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith does not look at the visible facts and say, &amp;ldquo;Oh! God has not
answered&amp;rdquo; but looks at the faith-facts and says &amp;ldquo;He who promised is
faithful. I have received what I asked from God.&amp;rdquo; After we have done
this, Jesus says, &amp;ldquo;It will be done for you. It will be yours.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not be surprised that faith works like this. It is how
salvation works. The new creation starts in the spirit by faith and
works its way into our flesh. In the same way healing and other answers
to prayer start in our spirit before being manifest in the flesh. It may
manifest in our flesh immediately or it may take time to develop in our
flesh. We are called to walk by faith, not sight. Abraham had
&lt;em&gt;not-seeing&lt;/em&gt; faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We live by faith, not by sight.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;2Co 5:7&lt;/strong&gt;) (Context is our hope for
resurrection)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what
is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;2Cor 4:18&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed&amp;mdash;the God
who gives life to the dead and &lt;strong&gt;calls things that are not as though
they were&lt;/strong&gt;. Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became
the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, &amp;ldquo;So shall
your offspring be.&amp;rdquo; Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact
that his body was as good as dead&amp;mdash;since he was about a hundred years
old&amp;mdash;and that Sarah&amp;rsquo;s womb was also dead. Yet he did not waver through
unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith
and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do
what he had promised.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 4:17-21&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot get Abraham&amp;rsquo;s blessing with Thomas&#39; faith (&amp;ldquo;When I see, then
I will believe.&amp;quot;) But if we are born again, we have Abraham&amp;rsquo;s faith;
that is how we got saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Understand, then, that those who believe are children of Abraham.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Ga 3:7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&amp;rsquo;s seed, and heirs
according to the promise.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ga 3:29&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-3---finding-faith&#34;&gt;Part 3 - Finding Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;our-spirit-is-not-our-mind&#34;&gt;Our spirit is not our mind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may have some promises and found the facts that God has given to
establish our faith, but that is still not the same as having faith.
Faith resides in our spirits, not in our minds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is
with your mouth that you confess and are saved.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 10:10&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture speaks of us having a spirit, a soul and a body (&lt;strong&gt;1Thess
5:23&lt;/strong&gt;). The soul refers to our mind &amp;ndash; the place of our intellect,
reasoning and emotions. Our spirit is the part that was dead before we
were born again and has the capacity to relate to God and receive
understanding of God&amp;rsquo;s will and faith to believe Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray
with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my
mind.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Co 14:15&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scriptures use heart/inner self/spirit interchangeably, and
mind/soul/natural man interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But the &lt;strong&gt;natural man&lt;/strong&gt; does not receive the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they
are spiritually discerned.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Co 2:14&lt;/strong&gt; NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For I delight in the law of God according to the &lt;strong&gt;inward man&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Rom 7:22&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are born again our spirit is renewed, but our minds and bodies
need to be brought into line with our spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God&amp;rsquo;s mercy, to offer
&lt;strong&gt;your bodies&lt;/strong&gt; as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God&amp;mdash;this is
your spiritual act of worship. Do not conform any longer to the pattern
of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of &lt;strong&gt;your mind&lt;/strong&gt;. Then
you will be able to test and approve what God&amp;rsquo;s will is&amp;mdash;his good,
pleasing and perfect will.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 12:1-2&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God works in our spirit, but we have to work that out in our bodies and
minds. We must renew our own minds with God&amp;rsquo;s word. We must offer our
bodies and minds to God as instruments of righteousness (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 6:13&lt;/strong&gt;).
When we are born again our spirits are fully redeemed but we await in
confident hope for the total renewal of our minds and bodies when we see
Jesus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not
yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like
him, for we shall see him as he is. Everyone who has this hope in him
purifies himself, just as he is pure.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Jo 3:3&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scriptures use the word heart to refer to our human, God enlivened
spirit, not to our minds. &amp;ldquo;he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and
circumcision is that &lt;strong&gt;of the heart, in the spirit&lt;/strong&gt;, not in the letter;
whose praise is not from men but from God.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 2:29&lt;/strong&gt; NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spirit relates to the spiritual realm, the soul to the intellectual
and emotional realm and the body to the physical realm. It is not the
soul/mind that believes for salvation but the spirit; &amp;ldquo;It is with the
&lt;strong&gt;heart&lt;/strong&gt; that we believe&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 10:10&lt;/strong&gt;). Thus we may often find
that our minds are not renewed and our intellect, emotions and reason is
offended by our faith. If to believe that you have received what you
cannot yet perceive is troublesome &amp;ndash; so be it. We believe with our
spirits, not our souls; with our hearts not our minds. Let it be our
spirit that renews our minds, not our minds that quench our spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith, the ability to believe God, is given to us when we are saved. We
can feed our spirit through prayer and meditation on God&amp;rsquo;s word and
through fellowship with other Christians. But recognising that faith
resides in our spirit is important. We are so used to operating out of
our intellect and physical skills that we can imagine that these are
what counts in God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom. But Paul cautions us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of
yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with
sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given
you. (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 12:3&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is written in the context of serving within the church. God is
looking for faith, not just faithful service. He wants to promote faith
and have leaders who &amp;ldquo;by faith and patience inherit the promises&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb
6:12&lt;/strong&gt;). So we are to consider the health of our faith, not the strength
of our skills in assessing ourselves and the same assessment must be
made when selecting leaders. Thank God for our skills and intellect, but
our spirit is not our mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-assent-is-not-faith&#34;&gt;Mental assent is not faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having seen that faith resides in our spirit not our minds, we can see
that it is wrong to look to our understanding for faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Trust in the LORD with &lt;strong&gt;all your heart&lt;/strong&gt; and lean &lt;strong&gt;not on your&lt;/strong&gt; own
&lt;strong&gt;understanding&lt;/strong&gt;; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make
your paths straight. Do &lt;strong&gt;not be wise in your own eyes&lt;/strong&gt;; fear the LORD
and shun evil.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Pr 3:5-7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may say we believe that the bible is true and that the Gospels are a
reliable record of Jesus words and ministry. But that is not faith. The
problem is that we use &amp;ldquo;the faith&amp;rdquo; to refer to the body of doctrine
which comprises Christian beliefs. This should not be confused with the
faith that is required to please God and obtain answered prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation comes to us when we believe Jesus with our heart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is
with your mouth that you confess and are saved.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 10:10&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe and then demonstrate our faith by confessing our salvation.
God responds by giving His Spirit to make us into a new creation. After
believing we enter into rest; faith comes first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do
not see.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 11:1&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now we who have believed enter that rest&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 4:3&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let God be true, and every man a liar.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 3:4&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as saving faith belongs to our hearts so also does on-going faith
for answered prayer. If you say, &amp;ldquo;I believe the bible, but I do not have
my petition&amp;rdquo; then you have mental assent not faith. In fact, you are
fooling yourself that believe. You may want to believe, but in fact you
don&amp;rsquo;t. If you did believe you would be saying, &amp;ldquo;I have my answer.&amp;rdquo; The
mind says, &amp;ldquo;I believe it but I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why I haven&amp;rsquo;t got it.&amp;rdquo;
The heart says &amp;ldquo;I have it, even though I can&amp;rsquo;t see it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, &amp;lsquo;Go, throw
yourself into the sea,&amp;rsquo; and does not doubt &lt;strong&gt;in his heart but believes&lt;/strong&gt;
that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 11:23&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are eager to confess to other believers (not doubters) that you
have the thing you are believing for, then you can be sure you have
faith in your heart, &amp;ldquo;for out of the overflow of his heart his mouth
speaks&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Lk 6:45&lt;/strong&gt;). But if you are afraid to confess it except to God
then you do not have faith, but hope. Keep praying and meditating on the
scriptures and speaking truth until you have faith. Faith grows as we
give glory to God (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 4:20&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hope-is-not-faith&#34;&gt;Hope is not faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have hope and think it is faith, but hope and faith are
different things with different purposes and must not be confused. Paul
said, &amp;ldquo;now these three remain: faith, hope and love&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Cor 13:13&lt;/strong&gt;).
Hope is a vision of a desirable but not yet obtained future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at
all. Who hopes for what he already has? But if we hope for what we do
not yet have, we wait for it patiently.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 8:24-25&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope always relates to future things, and often refers to uncertain
things, such as when Paul says, &amp;ldquo;I hope to visit you.&amp;rdquo; However, there is
a special kind of hope in the bible; a sure and certain hope. It is the
assured hope of one day receiving all that we have inherited in Christ.
It is part of the gospel message and is inspired by the Holy Spirit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters
the inner sanctuary behind the curtain. (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 6:19&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him,
so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
(&lt;strong&gt;Rom 15:13&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith has similarities with hope because it also relates to a desirable
but not yet visible future, but hope is not faith. A Christian may know
that the bible teaches the assured hope of resurrection yet may not have
assurance for themselves. They may have hope but not faith. Faith adds
certainty to that hope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do
not see.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 11:1&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith, therefore, adds assurance or certainty to hope. In the context of
prayer, faith has an even more specific role: it adds &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt;
certainty. In prayer, faith takes a future hope and makes it a present
reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyone &amp;hellip; who believes that what he says will happen, it will be done
for him. &amp;hellip;whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have
received it, and it will be yours.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 11:23-24&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;if you have faith and do not doubt &amp;hellip; it will be done. If you
believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Matt
21:21-22&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you have faith as small as a mustard seed&amp;hellip; it will move. Nothing
will be impossible for you.&amp;quot;(&lt;strong&gt;Matt 17:20&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said that He would answer the prayer of faith, not the prayer of
hope. There is no assurance that we will receive answers to our hopes in
prayer. &amp;ldquo;Jesus I ask you to do such and such because I really need help
here&amp;rdquo; is a prayer of hope not faith. A vision of a desirable future is
presented to God in this prayer, but that is not how Jesus instructed us
to pray. He said, &amp;ldquo;Whatever you ask for in prayer, &lt;strong&gt;believe that you
have received it, and it will be yours.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Faith says, &amp;ldquo;I am sure and
certain of what I hope for. Jesus has heard and granted my request. I
have my answer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation is by faith, not hope (&lt;strong&gt;Eph 2:8&lt;/strong&gt;). This is well understood.
A person hoping for salvation would be urged to put their faith in
Christ, so that they could stop hoping and make it real. Faith is the
realisation of things hoped for. We should approach prayer in exactly
the same way. Hoping God will answer your prayer is not faith. Faith is
knowing God has answered. Prayer is answered in response to faith, not
hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;denial-is-not-faith&#34;&gt;Denial is not faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although faith looks at unseen evidence, it does not deny our
experienced reality. Faith does not deny that symptoms are real, that
pain is real, that sin is real or that the devil is real. When Jesus
asked the blind man if he could see, he wanted a report of the
experienced facts, not a &amp;ldquo;confession of faith&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had spat on the man&amp;rsquo;s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus
asked, &amp;quot;Do you see anything?&amp;quot; He looked up and said, &amp;quot;I see people;
they look like trees walking around.&amp;quot; (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 8:23&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note the way Jesus asked his question. He could
have made a &amp;ldquo;faith confession&amp;rdquo; by asking, &amp;ldquo;What can you see?&amp;rdquo; rather
than &amp;ldquo;Can you see anything?&amp;rdquo; But it seems Jesus was not bothered by such
detail. However, the blind man&amp;rsquo;s experience was a challenge to Jesus&#39;
faith because he could not see clearly. The disciples might have given
up, but Jesus ministered healing again. Faith does not deny experienced
reality but neither does it allow those experiences to hold our
attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let us &lt;strong&gt;fix our eyes on Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;, the author and perfecter of our
faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its
shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb
12:2&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham is held up as our example of faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed&amp;mdash;the God who
gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they
were. &lt;strong&gt;Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed&lt;/strong&gt; and so became the
father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, &amp;quot;So shall your
offspring be.&amp;quot; Without weakening in his faith, he &lt;strong&gt;faced the fact that
his body was as good as dead&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;since he was about a hundred years
old&amp;mdash;and that Sarah&amp;rsquo;s womb was also dead. Yet he &lt;strong&gt;did not waver
through unbelief&lt;/strong&gt; regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in
his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had
power to do what he had promised.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 4:17-21&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham is an example of faith precisely because he hoped against all
hope. Abraham didn&amp;rsquo;t deny the fact but &amp;ldquo;faced the fact&amp;rdquo; that present
reality did not match the promise he was believing. It is not unbelief
or &amp;ldquo;negative confession&amp;rdquo; to say, &amp;ldquo;No. I am not yet healed. I still have
the pain.&amp;rdquo; But it is unbelief to say, &amp;ldquo;God has not granted my healing&amp;rdquo;
or &amp;ldquo;the prayer didn&amp;rsquo;t work&amp;rdquo;. Faith does not consider the problem, but
considers Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith (&lt;strong&gt;Heb. 12:2&lt;/strong&gt;).
We grow strong in our faith as we give glory to God, not as we give
attention and &amp;lsquo;glory&amp;rsquo; to our as yet unresolved problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than giving attention to the problem, focus your mind on what
Jesus has done for you and what He is doing for you as your High Priest.
Jesus is doing something for you right now. He is seated at the right
hand of God right now making intercession for you (&lt;strong&gt;Heb. 7:25&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we
profess.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 4:14&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My son, pay attention to what I say; listen closely to my words. &lt;strong&gt;Do
not let them out of your sight&lt;/strong&gt;, keep them within your heart; for they
are &lt;strong&gt;life&lt;/strong&gt; to those who find them and &lt;strong&gt;health&lt;/strong&gt; to a man&amp;rsquo;s whole
body.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Prov 4:20-22&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have
spoken to you are spirit and they are life.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jn 6:63&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith keeps God&amp;rsquo;s life-giving words in our thoughts and lets them hold
our attention. God has given us His Word to get our thinking
straightened out, so that we won&amp;rsquo;t be ignorant and so our believing will
be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no
longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. They
are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God
because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their
hearts.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Eph 4:17-18&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has said, &amp;ldquo;Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.&amp;rdquo; So we
say with confidence, &amp;ldquo;The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What
can man do to me?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 13:5-6&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;is-it-gods-will&#34;&gt;Is it God&amp;rsquo;s will?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ah!&amp;rdquo; someone will say, &amp;ldquo;But what if it isn&amp;rsquo;t God&amp;rsquo;s will for you to have
what you ask for.&amp;rdquo; To which I answer, somewhat simplistically, &amp;ldquo;But in
my bible, I have it written that Jesus said it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; God&amp;rsquo;s will to do
whatever we ask in believing prayer. So why don&amp;rsquo;t you concentrate on
doing what Jesus said, and let God worry about His part of the bargain?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ask and it will be given to you; For everyone who asks receives;&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Matt 7:7-8&lt;/strong&gt;) (this sentiment is repeated six times by Jesus in this
passage, and it is also recorded by Luke).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your
children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to
those who ask him!&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 7:11&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He replied, &amp;ldquo;Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if
you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain,
&amp;lsquo;Move from here to there&amp;rsquo; and it will move. Nothing will be impossible
for you.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 17:20&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you
ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mt 18:19&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not
doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig-tree, but also you
can say to this mountain, &amp;lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,&amp;rsquo; and it will
be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in
prayer.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Matt 21:21-22&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everything is possible for him who believes&amp;hellip; I tell you the truth, if
anyone says to this mountain, &amp;lsquo;Go, throw yourself into the sea,&amp;rsquo; and
does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen,
it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in
prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mk
11:22-24&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring
glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will
do it. (&lt;strong&gt;Jn 14:13-14&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish,
and it will be given you.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jn 15:7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jn 15:16&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth,
my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have
not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your
joy will be complete.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Joh 16:23-24&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus does not seem to be the least bit worried about what we might ask
for. Any one of the many recorded encouragements to ask could have been
qualified with &amp;ldquo;if it is God&amp;rsquo;s will&amp;rdquo;, but not a single such condition is
found in the gospel record among nearly 30 such promises. Let us be
honest. If a person says &amp;ldquo;But what if it isn&amp;rsquo;t God&amp;rsquo;s will for you to
have what you ask for&amp;rdquo; then you can hope that they will take care to ask
according to God&amp;rsquo;s will. I do not see asking for the wrong things as the
main problem that Jesus encountered. As it happens, we do read of Jesus
correcting someone who asked Him for something slightly dubious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the mother of Zebedee&amp;rsquo;s sons came to Jesus with her sons and,
kneeling down, asked a favour of him. &amp;ldquo;What is it you want?&amp;rdquo; he asked.
She said, &amp;ldquo;Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your
right and the other at your left in your kingdom.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know what
you are asking,&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to them. &amp;ldquo;Can you drink the cup I am going
to drink?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;We can,&amp;rdquo; they answered. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;You will indeed
drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to
grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by
my Father.&amp;rdquo; When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the
two brothers. (&lt;strong&gt;Mt 20:20-24&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that although the disciples were indignant about this request,
Jesus was not. There is not a hint of reprimand in Jesus&#39; response.
Indeed, He gives what He has the authority to give in meeting the
request. Not once do we read of Jesus refusing a request or reprimanding
someone for not asking in accordance with God&amp;rsquo;s will. The problem Jesus
confronted was not presumptuous faith but no faith. Jesus did not say
&amp;ldquo;When the Son of Man comes will he find people believing God for the
wrong things&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;Will He find faith on earth&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Lk 18:8&lt;/strong&gt;) So I say
again. You concentrate on asking God in believing prayer and let God
worry about fulfilling His promise to grant your request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that the apostles felt the need to add some qualification
to these promises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence
before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his
commands and do what pleases him.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Jo 3:21-22&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask
anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he
hears us&amp;mdash;whatever we ask&amp;mdash;we know that we have what we asked of him.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;1Jo 5:14-15&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yet you do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive,
because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jas
4:2-3&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jas
5:16&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives,
and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you
of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;1Pe 3:7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly a spirit filled believer who believes Jesus and takes His word
seriously is never going to knowingly ask for something contrary to
God&amp;rsquo;s will. We can confidently come to God in faith-filled prayer for
the abundance of His good gifts which the Father promises to give to
those who ask him. The issue is not God&amp;rsquo;s will, but our asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the occasions when we really do not know what God&amp;rsquo;s will is, we can
confidently use Jesus&amp;rsquo;s words from Gethsemane, &amp;ldquo;Not my will but yours be
done.&amp;rdquo; But when praying in accordance with God&amp;rsquo;s declared will we do not
need to use such words. We should pray single-mindedly for the result
confident in Jesus&#39; many promises to grant our requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-4---putting-faith-to-work&#34;&gt;Part 4 - Putting faith to work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;receiving-the-spirit&#34;&gt;Receiving the Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, God answers our prayers of faith. Faith says, &amp;ldquo;I have
got what I asked for&amp;rdquo; and confesses the fact even before seeing the
reality of the answer. The same is true when it comes to receiving the
Holy Spirit. We have a promise backed up by a fact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the
fact. Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father
the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Ac 2:32-33&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When praying for the gift of the Holy Spirit, we do not need to ask God
to give. We are not dependant on a promise but a &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt;; that God has
poured out His Spirit for believers. We see this in Acts where believers
were not asked &amp;lsquo;has God given you the Spirit?&amp;rsquo; but &amp;lsquo;have you received
the Spirit?&amp;rsquo; It is up to us to receive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked them, &amp;ldquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&amp;rdquo; They
answered, &amp;ldquo;No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Ac 19:2&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given the Spirit, we must receive Him by faith, just as we
receive salvation by faith. Then we must act on our faith by speaking in
tongues. The Spirit does not speak in tongues, we do, as the Spirit
prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in
other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ac 2:4&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that
the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.
For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. (&lt;strong&gt;Ac
10:45-46&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and
they spoke in tongues and prophesied.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ac 19:6&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here also we see that faith must be accompanied by action. Speaking
in tongues is how we demonstrate our faith in God&amp;rsquo;s promise to give the
Spirit. If we act in demonstration of our faith by speaking in tongues,
then God will give us &amp;ldquo;utterance&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been filled with the Holy Spirit, we also, like Stephen, need to
be filled with faith and power, then we will be able to obey Jesus&#39;
command to preach the Gospel with confirming signs and wonders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now Stephen, a man full of God&amp;rsquo;s grace and power, did great wonders and
miraculous signs among the people.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ac 6:8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;faith-without-works-is-dead&#34;&gt;Faith without works is dead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James says that faith without works is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no
deeds? Can such faith save him?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jas 2:14&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But someone will say, &amp;ldquo;You have faith; I have deeds.&amp;rdquo; Show me your
faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. You
believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that&amp;mdash;and
shudder. You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds
is useless? Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what
he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? You see that his
faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made
complete by what he did.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jas 2:18-22&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James is principally talking about evidence of faith in our moral
behaviour. But he takes Abraham offering Isaac as an example and thus
shows that the principal has a wider application. Like Abraham, we must
confess and act on our faith before we receive evidence. If you want to
wait for evidence before you confess it, you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. You&amp;rsquo;ve got the
cart before the horse. You&amp;rsquo;ll never inherit the promises that way. You
have to believe the promises in God&amp;rsquo;s Word are true for you, confess
them for yourself; then you possess them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does it say? &amp;ldquo;The word is near you; it is in your &lt;strong&gt;mouth&lt;/strong&gt; and
in your heart,&amp;rdquo; that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: That if
you confess with your &lt;strong&gt;mouth&lt;/strong&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&amp;rdquo; and believe in your
heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is
with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your
&lt;strong&gt;mouth&lt;/strong&gt; that you confess and are saved (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 10:8-10&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we see that the speaking out about one&amp;rsquo;s salvation is a required
part of receiving salvation. Confession in the heart to God is not
enough. Public confession is part of the package. The same is true of
any other prayer of faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is written: &amp;ldquo;I believed; therefore I have spoken.&amp;rdquo; With that same
spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak (&lt;strong&gt;2Cor 4:13&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere in the bible do we ever find faith receiving its answer without
action. Heart faith is not enough. It must be expressed somehow, either
by a physical act or through a spoken word and with thanksgiving to God.
If you cannot demonstrate your faith by action, you should confess it to
other people. It needs to go beyond the secrecy of you and God. It is
not that speaking it releases some magic but that hope is so easily
mistaken for faith. Acting on our faith or telling another person what
we have obtained by faith helps to reveal our true faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before
my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown
him before my Father in heaven.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mt 10:32-33&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and &lt;strong&gt;puts them into
practice&lt;/strong&gt; is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mt
7:24&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith without works is dead! Action without faith will fail, and faith
without action will fail. The people believed and shouted before the
walls of Jericho came down (&lt;strong&gt;Josh 6:20&lt;/strong&gt;). Shouting afterwards is easy!
Faith does so before it sees. If you don&amp;rsquo;t act, you did not have faith.
Or put positively, if you have faith, you will act. Who would not act if
they knew they had received their request? Give thanks after your prayer
and before you see the evidence of the answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and
petition, &lt;strong&gt;with thanksgiving&lt;/strong&gt;, present your requests to God. And the
peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts
and your minds in Christ Jesus.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Php 4:6-7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said something which seems very unfair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever
does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mt 13:12&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said this because it is true. It is how faith works. Faith begets
faith, doubt begets doubt. What you sow you reap. Those who have faith
will get more, but those who doubt will lose what little faith they
have. Whenever the storms of sickness or other challenge come along, one
standing on the word of God will overcome and be strengthened in their
faith, whilst the one who hears but does not truly believe and confess
them will be overcome and what little faith they had will be lost. The
only way to increase faith is to act on the faith you already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-fight-of-faith&#34;&gt;The Fight of Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith comes through our study of the word and through hearing sound
teaching. It is likely to be contested by circumstance and physical
evidence, in which case we must fight the fight of faith. We insist on
the truth of the word and deny the authority of any contrary evidence,
acting on and speaking the truth, not the lie. We must hold fast the
confession of our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is
faithful.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 10:23&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to
which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence
of many witnesses.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Ti 6:12&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight of faith takes place in our spirits and minds. All kinds of
&amp;lsquo;reasonable&amp;rsquo; arguments arise in our minds saying that we do not have
what God promised, that our prayer has not been answered, that Satan has
prevailed over us. We have to take every such thought captive and
declare instead the truth of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the
contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish
arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge
of God, and we &lt;strong&gt;take captive every thought&lt;/strong&gt; to make it &lt;strong&gt;obedient to
Christ&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;2Co 10:4-5&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an American proverb: &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t keep the birds from flying over
your head, but you can keep them from building a nest in your hair!&amp;rdquo; You
can refuse to dwell on Satan&amp;rsquo;s accusations. You can also refuse to put
evil thoughts into action. The best thing to do is to laugh at the devil
because he is a liar. Cultivate the habit of thinking big things
according to the Word and acting out your faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee
from you.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jas 4:7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it
says.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jas 1:22&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refuse fear and anxiety which undermine faith. Don&amp;rsquo;t think about
negative things, even if they are true! Think about the good truth of
God&amp;rsquo;s word and rejoice in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is
right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable&amp;mdash;if
anything is excellent or praiseworthy&amp;mdash;think about such things.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Phil 4:8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of trials, we should turn the tables on Satan, rejoicing in
the fact that trials serve to strengthen our faith, not undermine it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Consider it pure joy&lt;/strong&gt;, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many
kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops
perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so &lt;strong&gt;that you may&lt;/strong&gt; be
mature and complete, &lt;strong&gt;not lacking anything&lt;/strong&gt;. If any of you lacks
wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding
fault, and it will be given to him. But when he asks, &lt;strong&gt;he must believe
and not doubt&lt;/strong&gt;, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown
and tossed by the wind. That man should not think he will receive
anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he
does.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Jas 1:2-8&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weapons and armour of our warfare are faith in God and in His word.
Memorising scripture is one of our best defences, allowing us to recall
truth whenever we face attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full
armour of God so that you can take your stand against the devil&amp;rsquo;s
schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against
the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark
world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
Therefore put on the full armour of God, so that when the day of evil
comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done
everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled
round your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and
with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of
peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which
you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the
helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of
God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers
and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for
all the saints.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Eph 6:10-18&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let us be bold in our counter attack against the lies of Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Phil. 4:13&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The LORD is my light and my salvation&amp;mdash;whom shall I fear? The LORD is
the stronghold of my life&amp;mdash;of whom shall I be afraid?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ps 27:1&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Scripture says, &amp;ldquo;Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to
shame.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 10:11&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians are often very quickly offended if they hear another
Christian swear, but don&amp;rsquo;t even seem to notice when they speak words of
doubt and unbelief . I think the Gospels show us that Jesus would
consider speaking words of doubt and unbelief to be an offence far worse
than swearing! Doubt and fear come from the devil and we should have
nothing to do with them. We must stand against them with God&amp;rsquo;s word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;walking-in-victory&#34;&gt;Walking in victory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our inheritance in Jesus is not sickness and defeat but resurrection
victory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into
the kingdom of the Son he loves,&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Col 1:13&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be careful not to &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; what is not ours; not to speak of
troubles as if they were ours, but rather as impostors with no right of
abode or access. We should not endlessly confess our sin and failures
but confess God&amp;rsquo;s total forgiveness and grace. Let us confess our
righteousness in His sight because of Jesus. Neither should we confess
our sickness, but rather our inheritance of healing in Christ. If only
we believed that almighty God is IN US! What victory we would walk in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Co 15:57&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one
man, how much more will those who receive God&amp;rsquo;s abundant provision of
grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one
man, Jesus Christ.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 5:17&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the
one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Jo
4:4&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given promises to strengthen us against fear, which is so often
Satan&amp;rsquo;s weapon against us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your
God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my
righteous right hand.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Isa 41:10&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can
be against us?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 8:31&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it is important to recognise that the Holy Spirit is our helper,
not our doer. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t force himself upon us, but prompts and
encourages and empowers our actions. We must be willing and courageous
and act in the faith that God will empower us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. (&lt;strong&gt;Eph 6:10&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.&amp;rdquo; So we say with
confidence, &amp;ldquo;The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man
do to me?&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 13:5-6&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power
through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your
hearts through faith.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Eph 3:16-17&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this
world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;strong&gt;Joh 16:33&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may suffer many troubles in this life because of hostility to God,
but in our spirits, souls and bodies we can walk in victory. Victory
over sin, sickness and fear comes through faith as we believe and act in
demonstration of our confidence in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people who receive divine healing get sick again with the same
sickness. Their healing does not persist. Jesus spoke about this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places
seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, &amp;lsquo;I will return to the
house I left.&amp;rsquo; When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put
in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than
itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that
man is worse than the first. (&lt;strong&gt;Lu 11:24-26&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason a Christian gets sick in the first place is because of an
illegal intrusion of the devil. Healing prayer can drive out the
sickness, but if that person does not close the door to re-invasion by
maintaining their confidence in God&amp;rsquo;s promises, then Satan can easily
re-establish his former position. This is a serious problem because it
undermines faith for future healing. It is therefore essential that
healing is followed by repentance, the infilling of the Holy Spirit and
instruction on spiritual warfare. When Jesus healed He frequently said,
&amp;ldquo;Go and sin no more&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the
one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Jo
4:4&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple scripture can help to strengthen a person&amp;rsquo;s faith against
re-infection. If any symptoms reappear, we can declare, &amp;ldquo;God is in me!
There is no room for the devil as well.&amp;rdquo; And so kick him out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;faith-brings-peace&#34;&gt;Faith brings peace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellowship with Jesus is the mother of faith and joy. It is the source
of victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Joh
8:32&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may
be complete.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Joh 15:11&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our
Lord, is faithful.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;1Co 1:9&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith brings us to a place of rest in believing. It is not an inner
struggle. We may have to fight the devils accusations and other peoples
doubts, but faith is assurance, and assurance, by definition, brings
peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit
is life and peace;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ro 8:6&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in
him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy
Spirit.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ro 15:13&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now we who have believed enter that rest&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Heb 4:3&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of
righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Ro 14:17&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said to her, &amp;ldquo;Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be
freed from your suffering.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mr 5:34&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and
petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace
of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and
your minds in Christ Jesus.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Phil 4:6-7&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is evidenced by peace and joy in our hearts. If our hearts do not
condemn us, we receive whatever we ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before
God and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands
and do what pleases him. (&lt;strong&gt;1Jn 3:20-21&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;emulating-abraham&#34;&gt;Emulating Abraham&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have already seen, Abraham is held up as our example of faith. He
put into practice the things we have learnt in this study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed&amp;mdash;the God who
gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they
were. Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the
father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, &amp;quot;So shall your
offspring be.&amp;quot; Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that
his body was as good as dead&amp;mdash;since he was about a hundred years
old&amp;mdash;and that Sarah&amp;rsquo;s womb was also dead. Yet he did not waver through
unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith
and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do
what he had promised.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 4:17-21&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you see how he took the following steps that we have looked at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is Fact: Consider God&amp;rsquo;s statements of fact upon which your
faith is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe God&amp;rsquo;s word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith precedes sight: Call things that are not as though they were
(i.e. ignore the contradictory evidence)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give glory to God for His answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing of the woman with a flow of blood is another example of
faith in action. It is particularly instructive because the healing took
place without Jesus Himself taking any action. In that respect, it is
similar to our own healing. We take action to obtain healing because we
know what Jesus has already done for us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve
years. She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and
had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.
When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and
&lt;strong&gt;touched his cloak&lt;/strong&gt;, because she thought, &amp;ldquo;If I just touch his
clothes, &lt;strong&gt;I will be healed&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Immediately &lt;strong&gt;her bleeding stopped&lt;/strong&gt; and
she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. At once
Jesus realised that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the
crowd and asked, &amp;ldquo;Who touched my clothes?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;You see the people crowding
against you,&amp;rdquo; his disciples answered, &amp;ldquo;and yet you can ask, &amp;lsquo;Who touched
me?&#39;&amp;rdquo; But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. Then the
woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and,
trembling with fear, &lt;strong&gt;told him the whole truth&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 5:25-33&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see the same steps in her obtaining healing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her faith was based on fact: She had heard about Jesus healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She believed He would heal her. (&amp;ldquo;I will be healed&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She acted on her faith. (She touched His cloak)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gave glory to God for His answer (She told him the whole truth)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the pattern of faith that gains victory over the flesh, the
world, and the devil:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facts-&amp;gt;Faith-&amp;gt;Action-&amp;gt;Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other examples of this pattern of faith. It is how David
slaughtered Goliath, Joshua defeated Jericho and the prodigal son was
received back by his father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-model-prayer-for-healing&#34;&gt;A Model Prayer for healing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very hesitant about offering a model prayer for healing knowing how
susceptible we are to thinking that if we get the words right, God will
answer. But the following account of a prayer made by an elderly
missionary is, I think, quite instructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Father, this woman is Your child. She belongs to you. It is not right
that the devil should dominate her through sickness and disease. So we
thank You, Father, because You have made provision for her deliverance.
You laid her sickness and her diseases on Jesus, for it is written, &amp;lsquo;He
took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Then this retired
missionary exercised his authority over the devil based on the Word of
God. He said, &amp;ldquo;Now, Satan, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to take your hands off
this woman&amp;rsquo;s body because this body is a temple of the Holy Ghost. It
belongs to God and you&amp;rsquo;ve got no right to trespass on God&amp;rsquo;s property.
Now we demand that you remove yourself from God&amp;rsquo;s property.&amp;rdquo; Then the
retired missionary talked to the woman. He said, &amp;ldquo;Now, Sister, Satan has
oppressed your body with sickness, but God has made provision for your
deliverance. Your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost, and you are
commanded to glorify God in your body and in your spirit. Can God be
glorified in your body by the devil dominating it? No, therefore, you
stand against this sickness with me, and together we will demand that
Satan stop trespassing on God&amp;rsquo;s property.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three parties involved in sickness and healing, God, Satan and the
sick person, are addressed with simple confident faith in accordance
with God&amp;rsquo;s word. This is not a formula, but an example of a prayer of
faith which is in line with Jesus own ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul acknowledges that we experience present suffering with Christ
because of the wickedness of the fallen world we live in and we wait
patiently for the fullness of redemption, when we will receive
renewed bodies (see 1Cor 15:35ff for Pauls teaching about
resurrection bodies). For this he says &amp;ldquo;we hope for what we do not
yet have.&amp;rdquo; But note that it is specifically the final resurrection
redemption of our bodies which we do not yet have. Paul certainly
did not believe we have to wait for healing. He practiced healing as
an essential part of proclaiming and demonstrating the gospel (Ro
15:18-19)&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/organic-church/what-christ-has-done-for-us-interactive-preach/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-christ-has-done-for-us&#34;&gt;What Christ has done for us&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-the-youth-to-act-this-story-out&#34;&gt;Get the youth to act this story out:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev 12:7-12 Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels
fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.
But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The
great dragon was hurled down&amp;mdash;that ancient serpent called the devil,
or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the
earth, and his angels with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: &amp;ldquo;Now have come the salvation
and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his
Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them
before our God day and night, has been hurled down. They triumphed
over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony;
they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to
the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is
filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devil wants us to be sin-conscious; God wants us to be
righteousness-conscious. Paul warns us to guard against the fiery darts
of the evil one by wearing the breastplate of righteousness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist,
with the breastplate of righteousness in place (Eph 6:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose righteousness do you suppose we wear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-people-to-discuss-in-threes-each-verse-one-at-a-time&#34;&gt;Get people to discuss in threes, each verse, one at a time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each verse, get several people to say what it means to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He forgave us all our sins, having cancelled the accusation against
us. He has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. &lt;strong&gt;Col 2:10-14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having been justified (declared righteous) by faith, we have peace
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Rom 5:1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For by one sacrifice Jesus has made perfect forever those who are
being made holy&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no
more.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Heb 10:14,17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For he has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and brought us into
Jesus&#39; kingdom, through whom our sins are forgiveness. &lt;strong&gt;Col 1:13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interview-one-person-over-this-passage&#34;&gt;Interview one person over this passage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get them to &amp;quot;preach&amp;quot; each phrase, and ask the congregation for help
with anything they don&#39;t quite understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God&amp;rsquo;s
special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called
you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a
people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received
mercy, but now you have received mercy. &lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 2:9-10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>What is love</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/love/what-is-love/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/teaching-materials/love/what-is-love/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-love&#34;&gt;What is love?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS Lewis distinguishes between giving-love and need-love; we love God
because we need Him, but He loves us out of giving rather than need. He
also distinguishes between need-pleasure and appreciative-pleasure. We
enjoy a glass of water only when we are thirsty (need-pleasure) but we
enjoy the scent of a flower without having a need to smell flowers.
Need-pleasures are self-centred and passing (my need was met), whereas
appreciation pleasures are object-centred and enduring (that is
beautiful). These pleasures naturally lead to expressions of love, we
love those things that meet our needs, and we love those things whose
beauty delights us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I define giving-love as having a concern for, and taking delight in the
wellbeing and joy of another. It is a love that gives us pleasure, or it
is not love at all, but that pleasure is indirect. For instance I spent
an evening listening to Stravinsky&amp;rsquo;s Firebird with an elderly friend.
His wife said she wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in that sort of music and said she
would come and pick him up later . When she came to pick him up, I said
to her, &amp;ldquo;Ruth, just listen to the first few bars of this music&amp;rdquo;. She
humoured us and sat down. 20 minutes later she sat in silent spellbound
wonder. I had already enjoyed the music myself that evening, but it gave
me enormous added pleasure to see how much Ruth was moved by it. That
pleasure was itself two-fold. Partly I was pleased because I love the
music and feel it deserves peoples appreciation, but my greater pleasure
was because I loved Ruth and was so thrilled to see her evident wonder
and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need-love is easy to understand &amp;ndash; I love Mirrlees because she cooks
nice meals for me. Appreciative love is slightly more difficult; why
should I love the smell of sweet-peas? Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t know but the
appreciation of beauty enriches our lives. And so I also love Mirrlees
because of her qualities that I appreciate, such as her kindness. Both
of these loves are real and important and valid, but they are selfish;
neither are giving-loves. The test of giving love is &amp;ldquo;do I delight in
Mirrlees&#39; pleasure?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important for our receiving God&amp;rsquo;s love. His love is not
need-love. He does not need worshippers. God does not need us to
reassure Him that He is the almighty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s love is giving-love. As Paul says to the Romans, **^ &amp;ldquo;^**He who
did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all&amp;mdash;how will he not
also, along with him, graciously give us all things?&amp;rdquo; God loves us to
know His forgiveness and be free from guilt and shame and fear. He loves
to see our lives free from the corrupting effects of lies and deceit.
**&amp;quot;**It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then,
and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God loves our wellbeing; He loves our joy. Paul urges the Corinthian&amp;rsquo;s
not to &lt;strong&gt;receive God&amp;rsquo;s grace in vain.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a temptation to believe
that even after we have come to God in repentance for forgiveness, that
we still owe Him a debt of remorse and self-loathing. Yet when someone
has seriously wronged us and then comes in grovelling remorse it is most
irritating if they will not simply accept our forgiveness and move on.
To keep begging for forgiveness is tantamount to saying &amp;ldquo;I do not
believe you have forgiven me.&amp;rdquo; It is an insult to our integrity and our
ability to forgive. This is one aspect of receiving God&amp;rsquo;s grace in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul lived with the knowledge that he had actively persecuted Christ&amp;rsquo;s
brothers, having them arrested and thrown into prison, bringing terror
and misery to countless innocent families. He participated in the murder
of Stephen and perhaps in the death of other believers. He was arrested
by Jesus Himself and convicted of his sin against God and His people.
When Judas realised how he had sinned against Jesus, he went and hung
himself; but Paul became a passionate advocate for the gospel. Was Judas
beyond forgiveness? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. Jesus forgave those who nailed Him
to the cross. Although Paul was keenly aware that he had once been an
enemy of God, he was clearly not preoccupied with that thought. He had
received forgiveness from God, and that set Him free from the paralysing
feelings of guilt and shame. No doubt from time to time he did or said
things he later regretted and needed to receive further forgiveness from
God. But Paul clearly lived with a clear conscience, untroubled by his
previous sins and failings &amp;ndash; and not because he didn&amp;rsquo;t care about them,
but because He received the grace of God in forgiveness. Paul&amp;rsquo;s appeal
to the Corinthians was that they should not receive the grace of God in
vain. Have we learnt to fully receive God&amp;rsquo;s love and forgiveness? Do we
live with guilt and shame for past failings that continue to plague our
thoughts? The gracious forgiveness of God has been demonstrated on the
cross and promised to us in scripture, but is received by faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not always easy to receive God&amp;rsquo;s forgiveness; sometimes we cannot
truly believe God has totally forgiven us and that he does not want us
to carry a burden of guilt. ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What motivated Paul to withstand such difficulties in ministry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of pursuing some great goal many people endure incredible
hardship. Mountaineers and polar explorers for example. Most of us have
endure hardship of some sort for the prospect of future gain &amp;ndash; studying
for exams for example. Or scrimping and saving to get together the money
for a deposit on our first home. Paul describes some of the hardships he
has endured for the sake of his ministry, &amp;ldquo;so that our ministry will not
be discredited&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is motivated by two loves; firstly an appreciation for the Love of
God; the desire to see as many people as possible share in that
appreciation because God&amp;rsquo;s love is so beautiful. And secondly his love
for people. Paul loved the Corinthians as his own children. He loved
their wellbeing and joy, and knew that Jesus was the true means to the
greatest joys. He is not driven by need-love. Paul does not need the
adulation of men; far from it! He rebukes those who seek to please men
rather than God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our own relationship with God is firstly and primarily one of need-love.
We need His love and forgiveness. We need His assurances and care. We
are children in need of His care. Many Psalms are written from this
perspective, crying out for God&amp;rsquo;s deliverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we get to know Him we begin to appreciate Him for who He is. We
love His faithfulness, we delight in His righteousness, we wonder at His
glory. The more we appreciate Him the more we will want to make Him
known. This leads us to delight in worshipping Him, singing songs that
exalt His wondrous qualities. We see this appreciative love expressed in
many of the Psalms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither our need of God nor our appreciation of His qualities
necessitates a personal relationship with God; one in which giving love
is a two-way experience. Although God has no need of us, we can
nevertheless give Him pleasure. The scriptures tell us again and again
that God takes pleasure in the righteous, in those who put their trust
in Him, in those who take risks of faith in Him. He has no pleasure in
those who shrink back in fear. We can please God through our trust in
Him, and we can take delight in God&amp;rsquo;s pleasure. These things are the
essence of a personal relationship with God. It goes beyond simple need
and appreciation and includes a joyful motivation to give God pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
